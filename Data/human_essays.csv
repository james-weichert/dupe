English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Vicar of Wakefield as a Failed Morality Story,"Morality stories and plays that espouse Christian values have been incredibly popular in the history of English literature. In The Vicar of Wakefield, Oliver Goldsmith presents a narrator who gives an account of the events that transpire in his family with a, nearly overbearing at times, critical voice that points out Christian morality in every section of his story. These morals, however, or not necessarily Christian, and are certainly different than the morals we see portrayed in older Christian morality stories, such as Everyman, which is a 15th century morality play. Though the narrator attempts to impose morals on every part of the tale he describes, the Vicar of Wakefield is ultimately a failed Christian morality story, as the plot of the story and the action of the characters fail to portray the importance of Christian morals, and the morals it does convey are often conflicted.

A Christian morality story, in the sense that I will be using it, is defined as a story that seeks to teach the reader lessons about the importance of Christian morals. Almost every story ever written has a moral; colloquially this term has become synonymous with the idea of a take home message that the author of a text is attempting to impart on the reader. The phrase, the moral of the story, has arisen from a tradition of using stories to teach morals. In the later Middle Ages, around the late 15th and early 16th centuries, morality plays were incredibly common and popular in England. Morality plays often involve characters that are representative of larger social groups, abstract ideas, or objects. In the play Everyman, the protagonist is a character named Everyman who discovers he must die and has to fight off his old sins in the form of characters to be redeemed in God's eyes when he is judged. The play is incredibly heavy-handed with its morals—even God is a character that spouts his judgments out to the watching crowds. The morals that this play, and most morality plays, portray are quite different from what we see in the Vicar of Wakefield. As Everyman approaches heaven alone in the eyes of God, it teaches the reader that all men are truly alone in responsibility for their sins. Everyman must learn to turn away from his love of friends, goods, and spirits in order to redeem himself. The play imparts Christian morals in a harsh, stark way. Its main lesson is that man stands alone before the eyes of God.

The lessons that morality plays espouse continue throughout literature even after their popularity fades. In Shakespeare's King Lear we are presented with a tale of a man who is destroyed by making poor choices and loving the wrong people. There is no redemption for Lear, who dies at the end of the play alone in his suffering before God. We can see a clear shift from this type of morality story, one in which a lone protagonist is stripped of everything he owns and must die and face the wrath of God, to the kind of attempted morality story that we see in The Vicar of Wakefield. In this new kind of story, we have a protagonist who is literally constantly surrounded by others, and rather than the judgment of God, we see the judgment of the narrator on all those around him.

The narrator's judgmental nature is what leads the Vicar of Wakefield toward failure in its moral delivery. This judgmental air signifies a different kind of story—one in which the individual's life choices and events have become just as significant as the events in his afterlife. In the Vicar of Wakefield, judgment is something that occurs during this lifetime, with punishment coming in the form of poverty and reward in the form of wealth.

This is precisely why The Vicar of Wakefield fails to be a true Christian moral story. Though the narrator continually criticizes a love of wealth, saying, the nakedness of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trimmings of the vain, when his wife and daughters attempt to dress up for church, we do not see this sentiment echoed in the action of the play. The wife and daughters never give up their love of finery, as a few weeks later they are at it again, asking to ride the horses to church, and are in the end rewarded by being married to rich men. This is incredibly different from the reward of death and renewal in God's love that we see in morality plays.

It is interesting that the narrator of this novel seems so convinced that he and his family are the perfect embodiment of Christian ideals. His wife seems more conniving that pious. London is the only place in the world for husbands. …as Ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality be! She is the very embodiment of Mrs. Bennett from Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, and all of her meddling is rewarded in the end of the novel when her daughters are married to rich husbands. Charles, the narrator, is continually over-ridden and controlled by the whims of his family, rather than being the traditional stern and controlling father figure that is presented in most Christian tales. He is also given to moments of uncontrollable inaction. He finds himself unable to save his daughter as she is drowning in a river, and when he goes to rescue Olivia when she runs away he is waylaid for three weeks with illness. His inaction does not belie a kind of Christian fortitude to do what is right, and he is never punished for his inaction. Even, the unfortunate Moses was deceived (84). This is quite unlike the biblical Moses, who had the clairvoyance to be able to perceive the voice of God. He saw past the pharaoh's tricks in order to save his people. Moses Wakefield was not even able to see through the tricks of a common thief at market to help his family. The family is clearly lacking in Christian morals and strengths, and rather than atoning for this, they go through hardship only to be rewarded with wealth in the form of marriage to wealthy men. Rather than poverty being a blessing that allows them to live closer to God, as it is in when Everyman casts away his goods, it is an ordeal that they must live through and are rewarded for surviving by the acquiring of vast wealth. The business of wedding transactions is akin to winning the lottery plus a Get Out of Jail Free card to the Wakefield family. The moral lesson that we see here is, endure poverty, be good to those around you, and God will reward you with vast material riches. This is quite different from the reward of God's eternal love that Everyman and Lear receive after their deaths.

This is not to say, however, that The Vicar of Wakefield is completely devoid of morals. Rather, this story serves to show us how Christian morals are changing with society. Perhaps due to a rising middle class and exchange of goods an idea of reciprocity has entered Christianity. We can still see that an idea of giving to God without expecting in return is upheld in the vicar's exhortations, yet there is also a new idea that, Former benevolence [will be] repaid with unexpected interest (184). So, perhaps the morals haven't changed so much as the timeline seems to have changed—reciprocity can happen in this life or the next. We can see characters making larger strides to prove that they are doing good deeds, that they merit have wealth in their lives because of their good deeds. …never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveler or poor dependent out of doors, (38) the narrator tells us, and indeed he spends the entire first chapter explaining his families goodness, benevolence, and charity. There is clearly a sentiment that one must justify ones wealth, or to say, one's wealth is a result of one's charity. In short, moral good is rewarded in this life as well as in the next.

There is also an interesting sense that to be an upstanding, moral person one must be educated. This could be due to the rising importance of the marriage market within the middle class, however it is cited many times within the book that the women are able to read, and that this fact improves their worth. I armed her against the censures of the world, shewed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the miserable, and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would at least teach us to endure it (140). This shows a changed attitude about the morality of books. Previously we have seen a trend in literature toward viewing books as agents of evil and subversion. Books were to be feared. Yet this clearly shows that the vicar views books to be protective against ignorance. To him, they are something helpful he wishes to share with his daughter to help her through difficulty. Books are an aide that can lead Olivia back when she has gone astray. The only reference we see in The Vicar of Wakefield to the older idea that books are somewhat subversive is in the first chapter. The narrator tells us that his wife, During her pregnancy had been reading romances, [and] insisted upon [the name] Olivia (39). This seems to have a negative connotation, as the narrator later insists that he, had no hand in it (39). Books clearly still have some of their negative connotation, in that they still seem to be seen to have the power to subvert or take control of the reader's mind in a forceful way, yet overall it seems that books have lost most of their negative connotation and are viewed as healthy, moral objects.

The final conflicted moral that the book attempts to teach is that one must be loyal to one's family in order to be a moral person. The narrator spends countless pages exhorting his family and his love for his family. The book ends with the narrator, seeing all [his] family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside (199). It is clear that he sees nothing more perfect in life than a happy, loyal family. Yet is the narrator's family loyal? Olivia runs away from home, which, at the time, was a grievous insult to her families honor. In fact, there is little she could have done that would have been less loyal to her family. She even gets married behind their backs. Also, the father shows very little regard for his family when he stays in jail to prove his point against Mister Thornhill even after he hears that Olivia is dying and that it is tearing his family apart. Is his pride—one of the seven deadly sins—more important than his family? The actions of these two characters create conflict in what is the story's most heavily emphasized moral.

It is clear that The Vicar of Wakefield does not fit in with earlier Christian morality stories, as it doesn't emphasize the same morals, and it even refutes several of the moral lessons taught by morality plays such as Everyman. It is also unclear as to its own moral message, while still obviously trying to impart a strong one. While the plot of the story and the actions of the characters show an interesting shift in ideas surrounding morality and Christianity around a time when the middle class was rising in England, it does not do an effective job of explaining what these new morals are. In this sense, The Vicar of Wakefield fails as a true Christian morality story.",0,0,0,1.48,11115
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Governmental Funding for the Development of Self-Sustaining Communities: The Stabilization of the HIV/AIDS Crisis,"At the end of 2006, over 39.5 million people were living with HIV globally. The year saw over 4.3 million new infections, with over one-third of HIV-AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the pandemic (Global). On a continent where two-thirds of the population lives on less that one or two dollars a day, the disease devastates poor communities (World Vision International). Because HIV/AIDS can infect anyone (not just the young, elderly, and sick), the disease frequently infects middle-aged people in vital societal positions. These people then can no longer function as agricultural workers, health-care providers, and teachers within communities (World Vision Aids Experience). The United States, along with the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries, should increase funding for the development of HIV-AIDS-educated, sustainable communities in Africa and globally to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Educated, sustainable communities will stabilize the pandemic by creating environments where those affected by HIV/AIDS have the necessary resources to combat the disease successfully.

Currently, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is fighting the battle against the disease. UNAIDS is an organization of ten smaller United Nations groups. The organization does much of its work creating action plans for leading industrialized nations to follow to combat the disease. UNAIDS presented a plan to stabilize and eventually even phase out HIV/AIDS in 2005 (Schroering). This plan, titled the Universal Access Plan, discusses the current needs of the countries most seriously affected by the pandemic. The Universal Access Plan outlines the necessary monetary support needed to combat HIV/AIDS globally, including a tiered system to yearly increase the amount of funding for HIV/AIDS. The underlying theory of the plan is that if the appropriate amount of financial support is received, HIV/AIDS could be so effectively subdued that infection rates would stabilize and begin to taper, eventually even diminishing. The tiered system would provide complete funding for all necessary programs to stabilize infection rates by 2015, totaling approximately 100 billion US dollars of funding (Financial 13). The necessary programs envisioned would include traditional programs that provide medicine, food, and sexual education, in addition to more innovative programs targeting some root-issues exacerbating the disease: sustainable community development for communities ravaged by HIV-AIDS, and education programs targeted at the myths and stigmas that surround and attribute to spread of the disease.

While the work UNAIDS did to create the Universal Access Plan is an amazing step in the right direction to eradicate HIV/AIDS, no leading country has yet collaborated with UNAIDS to enact the plan. The United States and its global partners should be working with UNAIDS to complete the proposed plan. After creating the Universal Access Plan, UNAIDS presented it to the Group of Eight (G8), a global needs awareness collation, which includes the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Japan. The G8, one of the most powerful global entities, showed great support for the Universal Access Plan; however, to date it has not implemented the plan. Using the tiered scale-up plan, the G8 is more than capable of providing the prevention and education programs, medical therapies, sustainable-community programs, and ambitious attitude needed to start curbing infection rates and reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS and related concerns. However, the G8 has not lived up to its identity as a global leadership team. The G8's past involvement in HIV/AIDS crises proves that it is the best candidate to enact the Universal Access Plan. When the governments of the G8 countries work with HIV-affected areas, they motivate the local and national governments to make ambitious goals leading to stabilization of the virus (Financial 15). The G8 needs to reengage in the HIV/AIDS crisis immediately, to prevent the pandemic from becoming even bigger.

There is a certain urgency needed to effectively combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The concept of an ever-increasing pandemic holds a dually evil nature. The longer the G8 waits to implement the Universal Access Plan, the more people will struggle against HIV/AIDS, and the more lives will be lost to the pandemic. Less intuitive, however, is the fact that the longer the G8 waits, the more difficult curbing the virus will become. Because of the explosive nature of HIV/AIDS, increasing infection rates create more people who need care, and more programs needed to assist those who need care. Thus, as the pandemic continues to reign unchecked, more financial support is needed to effectively stand against the disease. By taking a passive stance concerning the Universal Access Plan, the G8 is only exacerbating the HIV/AIDS problem. For example, the Universal Access Plan projects that per year, about 10 billion US dollars are needed for the next ten years to supply every HIV/AIDS infected person with necessary healthcare, and implement effective national education and prevention programs to decrease infection rates (Financial, 15). However, if no group takes initiative within the next five years, the numbers will be even larger. Immediate application of the Universal Access Plan would prevent over half of the new infections that are projected to occur between 2005 and 2015. The 2005 UNAIDS Financial Resources report cites the implications of the G8's passivity the best:

The high levels of funding that will be needed to move towards universal access [care for all HIV/AIDS-affected persons] in the coming years reflect the world's failure to respond to the epidemic before it achieved crisis dimensions. Had the world made prudent investments 10-20 years ago – in prevention, in strengthening health systems in low- and middle-income countries, in preserving and building essential human resources, in addressing the corrosive effects of gender inequities and other drivers of the epidemic – much smaller amounts would be required today (Financial 5).

Just as the lack of response from global leaders in the past created a crisis today, careless attitudes concerning HIV/AIDS today will render a catastrophe of epic proportions if the G8 and other global leaders do not make some financial contribution now.

Some would say that the United States and other national governments should not be responsible for dealing with the financial burden of HIV/AIDS, because that job belongs to the various humanitarian organizations like UNAIDS that already work with the disease. It is true that national governments have many concerns to balance, and the weight of AIDS does not make the burden lighter. The reality is, however, that global governmental groups are by far in the best position to move against HIV/AIDS. Humanitarian organizations are most effective in providing on-the-ground support running medical clinics, supplying food and shelter, and running educational camps to teach people about HIV/AIDS. However, they are not as well suited to build a financial support system of the proportion needed to eradicate HIV/AIDS. Relief organizations are funded by donations from private individuals, in addition to occasional corporate funding. Because funding for these organizations comes from individual people, it would be impossible for any group of relief organizations to raise the 100 billion of projected need. Additionally, it is difficult for relief organizations to obtain permission to be present from both national and local governments in foreign areas affected by HIV/AIDS. Often relief is only provided to countries that invite the relief organizations to participate in the combat of HIV/AIDS. This makes it difficult to implement the necessary health, educational, and sustainability programs needed to relieve stress on struggling communities.

In contrast, global governmental groups like the G8 can easily provide the funding needed for HIV/AIDS. The countries that comprise the G8 represent approximately 65 percent of the world economy (Of the eight countries involved, seven of them hold positions as the highest military expenditure countries globally) (G8). If each of the G8 countries pledged an equal share of the needed 100 billion in funds, each country would contribute 12.5 billion US dollars. In a nation where hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on military funding and war every year, it seems that 12.5 billion in funding is a minor expense to pay to curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Additionally, world-recognized groups like the G8 are in a better position to provide needs to struggling areas because they have more political power and can work directly with national governments to implement plans that affect local communities. They do not have to struggle with the same bureaucratic red tape many humanitarian organizations deal with. As a globally recognized authority, the G8 has both the financial resources and the political influence to enact such a comprehensive plan.

Because the G8 as a united entity needs to step up to the challenge of HIV/AIDS, one might ask why the United States should contribute more money to the HIV/AIDS crisis when President Bush has already generously implemented The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). One could argue that the United States is already concerned about HIV/AIDS and that the other G8 countries need to do more. President Bush's concern and active stance against HIV/AIDS are admirable. Unfortunately, the PEPFAR program falls short of the need for intervention. PEPFAR has guaranteed 20 billion for AIDS funding sometime in the next ten years. However, the funding is geared to treat 2.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS by 2015. While these efforts are commendable, UNAIDS predicts that by 2010 there will already be over 10 million people in need of treatment (Schroering). By simple mathematical analysis, this means that the format of the PEPFAR program would dictate a need for 120 billion (over four times the promised amount of funding) to actually provide universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention measures outlined in the Universal Access Plan. Clearly, it seems that the PEPFAR program misallocates its resources to serve such a small number of people. The PEPFAR program's flaws are that it allocates most of its funds for the physical treatment of HIV/AIDS through antiretroviral therapy (medicinal) provision and some sexual education, in an untimely fashion. While these issues need to be addressed to combat HIV/AIDS infection and death rates, they do not get to the root problems of the HIV/AIDS virus. PEPFAR has no programs focused on disease education and sustainable community development, and it does not follow the projected UNAIDS timeline. Thus, the United States needs to remain actively engaged combating the disease because its current measures against the disease will not work. The United States is the most powerful nation in the world, so it needs to lead a powerful plan to combat HIV/AIDS that includes funding for solutions to the root problems surrounding HIV/AIDS.

The type of funding that will curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic has already been outlined by UNAIDS in the Universal Access Plan. Plans like PEPFAR need to provide funding for antiretroviral treatments and sexual education programs, but they must also provide funding for programs that educate about the actual circumstances of the disease. They additionally need to provide funding for sustainable community development. Because the PEPFAR program does not fully address problems like food shortages, education about HIV/AIDS, and other issues the Universal Access Plan does address, the money, time, and effort given to PEPFAR has a small return in terms of its impact on the pandemic. Without funding to combat issues that are root problems of the HIV/AIDS crisis, progress against the disease that leads to an eventual phase-out of funding will not be made. Education programs that teach people about the stigmas and myths associated with HIV-AIDS are much more effective in slowing its transmission as sexual education programs. Sustainable community development programs build communities that become economically self-dependant, creating opportunities to end funding. Without funding for the education and sustainable community development programs that the Universal Access Plan calls for, financial support for HIV-AIDS becomes a life-line to struggling communities. Funding that only provides medicine and sexual education programs is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken arm; the arm will only get more infected because it was not given the proper treatment. PEPFAR is not a solution to the HIV/AIDS crisis; it is only a basis to begin larger-scale efforts like those presented by the UNAIDS Universal Access Program.

The two most necessary focuses of HIV-AIDS prevention are sustainable community development and HIV-AIDS education. HIV-AIDS education should be focused on sexual education, but the actual facts about what the disease is and how it affects people are just as important. The stigmas and myths that surround the virus increase its transmission, while deplorable living conditions make maintaining a healthy HIV-positive status difficult (World Vision Aids Experience). Education about the disease will diffuse these myths, while learning domestic skills like growing crops or producing a retail good like jewelry, baskets, or cloth will help people in HIV-affected communities stabilize their economic need, decreasing constant dependence on relief money.

Uganda is a model country that has implemented effective educational programs about HIV/AIDS. The programs it implemented serve to teach people the difference between reality and the myths and stigmas that contribute to high infection rates. Many think AIDS is a curse from God, witchcraft, or a means of warfare by industrialized countries like the United States (World Vision Aids Experience). These false beliefs create stigmas that cause a plethora of problems. Frequently, people struck ill with HIV/AIDS do not receive care because family and community members believe casual contact, like being coughed on or touching infected people can transmit HIV. When the parents of young children in Africa die from AIDS, relatives who could care for them often abandon the children; in some cases they are even rejected from the community. This rejection and lack of care yields the child-headed household phenomenon: one child caring for several younger siblings while dually trying to provide basic needs like food, without the opportunity to pursue an education. Likewise, some people believe that having sex with virgins cure HIV or that condoms spread HIV. This myth increases incidents of rape and unprotected sexual activity (World Vision Aids Experience). By implementing a national educational program about HIV/AIDS, Uganda successfully diffused these types of myths, decreasing its infection rate to fewer than three percent of the national population (World Vision Aids Experience). Those who already have the virus are less stigmatized, receiving better care from health clinics and their families or friends. Funding for more national educational programs like those in Uganda would slow down the infection rate and reduce stigmas around HIV/AIDS patients. The G8 should be funding these kinds of education programs. Because these programs target the unhealthy trends that spread HIV-AIDS, educational programs will lead to eradication of HIV-AIDS much faster and with much less funding that only giving people antiretroviral drugs and condoms.

Apart from stigmas and myths, the problem of non-self-sustainable communities generates multiple economic issues for countries fighting HIV-AIDS. Inadequate food supplies and clean drinking water cause those who could be healthily living with HIV to struggle. Antiretroviral drugs will not work without proper nutrition. This poses a huge problem in areas where agricultural workers often contract HIV and cannot accomplish their job of producing food (World Vision International). The labor supply for the agricultural community dwindles, and food shortages become abundant. Governments themselves feel economic repercussions from lower agricultural production, inhibiting their ability to provide relief to their own citizens. The few relief programs that attempt to develop sustainable communities teach individuals and communities how to cultivate gardens that can produce the grains, fruits, and vegetables needed to feed the community. Many humanitarian organizations have tried without success to develop the sustainable community programs needed to help HIV-AIDS-ravaged areas become economically independent again.

The reality simply is that humanitarian organizations do not have the might to create comprehensive, far-reaching sustainability programs. While they may teach an individual to grow vegetables for daily food, they cannot mandate governmental programs to provide employment or education. Industrialized nations like the United Sates that have previously experienced economic crises have an advantageous position in assisting struggling countries. National governments understand the economic needs of the individual people, but also of the country as a whole. For example, during the Great Depression, President Roosevelt created the New Deal program to serve many issues experienced due to the strained economy. One part of his program generated jobs for individual people through civil service industries like building and repairing infrastructures. The all-encompassing financial reformations, however, provided relief to the nation as a whole. The United States with the G8 can assist third world countries to develop the necessary sustainable community programs to help create governments that deal with HIV-AIDS internally, without need for funding in the future. If the G8 would provide the basis funding to launch comprehensive sustainable community development programs, later funding would be unnecessary. All of the countries represented in the G8 have experienced national crises before and successfully emerged from them. Thus, it is much better for the experienced G8 to help struggling communities, both locally and nationally.

Many humanitarian organizations are passionately committed to eradicating HIV-AIDS. Funds raised by the private sector are helpful in providing community-to-community support through education, heath needs, and development of sustainable community programs. Unfortunately, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is already too big for these relief organizations. National governments like those involved in the G8 should increase the funding for HIV/AIDS relief and develop programs that deal with the root-problems exacerbating the effects of the virus. If nationally funded programs were in place to create communities where local citizens were self-sufficient and well-informed about HIV-AIDS, instead of providing short-term relief through medicinal support and sexual education for suffering countries, governmental monies would create environments that no longer depended on foreign aid. The HIV/AIDS pandemic would stabilize and in a few decades eventually recede, ending the need for funding. The G8 and other national governments can only help themselves by fighting HIV/AIDS. With the proper resources and allocation of funding, the G8 could easily stabilize HIV/AIDS by 2015, eliminating a pandemic that will only present more problems in the future if not dealt with immediately. The United States, the most powerful nation in the world, should set an example for the rest of the G8 by implementing the full Universal Access Plan, and as soon as possible. It is our responsibility both as leaders and human beings, and making the right decisions for funding as soon as possible can prevent a future epic disaster.",50.19,68.22,35.78,35.13,20057
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Who Is God?,"One common problem for the Christian tradition is the idea of evil in the world. Many struggle to believe in a faithful and loving god when there are so many apparent problems with society. People feel that if God is so loving and just, merciful and great, He would not let there be so much pain and struggle and toil in the world. Toil is a concept thoroughly explored in William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. In Faulkner's tale, the Bundren family endures physical and emotional pain to a heightened degree, while claiming trust in a god who seems not to care about them at all. Faulkner explores one's personal view of God through the suffering of the family as they try to bury their dead wife and mother. He creates in the character of Anse one who trusts in God, but through Anse's crude musings on theology and scripture, Faulkner actually paints an unjust and unfaithful god.

Faulkner introduces the character Anse with in a monologue where Anse is complaining about all of the things going wrong in his life. Anse blames a number of different objects and people for the grievances he suffers, in a seemingly random fashion that impresses on the reader his dismal outlook on life. However, upon a closer look at Anse's problems, a common theme emerges. The major and continuous problem Anse finds in his pathetic life is the road by his house. His first statement is Durn that road, (35), followed by a cursing of the rain, his sons, the men or government in charge of building the road, and even the idea of taxation. While Anse does not solely curse the road, he curses the rain because it appears to travel up the road toward his farm. He curses his sons because they have to travel on the road; he curses the men for building the road; he curses paying taxes because his tax money probably helped pay for the road. Amidst Anse's philosophizing, there are deeper concepts within the language that Faulkner uses to explore the impact of the road on Anse's life.

When Anse begins his monologue about the problematic road, he contemplates God's role in the creation of the road. Anse reasons that God (through divine intervention) uses men to build roads on the earth, and that in His divine power, He would never build a road and later build a house beside it. Anse states that instead, Man has somehow aggravated God's initial intention for roads by building houses beside them: precisely where they should not be. Anse concludes this portion of his monologue and begins his next point about the road:

…keeping the folks restless and wanting to get up and go somewheres else when He aimed for them to stay put like a tree or a stand of corn. Because if He'd aimed for man to be always a-moving and going somewheres else, wouldn't He a put him longways on his belly, like a snake? It stands to reason He would.

Putting it where every bad luck prowling can find it and come straight to my door, charging me taxes on top of it. Making me pay for Cash…(36).

The abrupt transition between these two paragraphs makes one ask, But wait, who does the phrase 'putting it' refer to? It may be an implicit reference to the men who built the road; however, because this idea is unclear, the unidentified party responsible for building the road could also be read as God. Whether or not this logic is correct, Anse has already discussed that God plays some role in human actions, by crediting God with the concept of a road: God put roads for traveling (35). This causes an interpretation problem for the reader: Faulkner has allowed his character seemingly to contradict himself by stating that God does not lay roads by houses, but then leaving the language vague enough for one reasonably to assume Anse is still cursing God for building the road near the pre-existing house. Because Anse has already stated that God does not build roads by houses, this generates the idea that God is breaking His own rules.

If Anse's character is saying implicitly that God has broken His own rules, then the rest of Anse's monologue develops new meaning. Next, Anse discusses his eldest son Cash. Here it is useful to note that Anse regards his entire family as his possession on a level uncommon in society today. Not only are they his flesh and blood, but their time and ability to produce fruitful labor belongs to him as well. This concept becomes apparent when Jewel purchases the horse and Anse reprimands him. You know how tight it is for us to make money, yet you bought a horse for me to feed. Taken the work from your flesh and blood and bought a horse with it, (136). Thus, Anse survives off the abilities and hard work of his family. It is worthy to note that Faulkner names Anse's most financially prosperous son Cash, – precisely that which he means to Anse. Anse complains further in his monologue by saying of Cash, Making me pay for Cash having to get them carpenter notions when if it hadn't been no road come there, he wouldn't a got them; falling off of churches and… (36). Here Cash, the bringer of financial prosperity, has fallen off a church: a house of God. The very same God who caused the building of the road that brings all of Anse's problems has ironically through the road given Cash a means of financial stability, and then taken it away again through his workmanship on a church. Not only has Cash fallen off the church, but he is also injured, so Anse will not make any money from Cash's work. It would seem that the road God allowed to be built by the house is not helpful to Anse's financial or personal situation.

Within his final rant about the road, Anse blames it for Addie being sick. His unclear logical connection between the road and Addie dying only exacerbates the idea that something supernatural or divine must be at work to make a simple road the reason for someone to die. He says of his ill wife:

She was well and hale as ere a woman were, except for that road. Just laying down, resting herself in her own bed, asking naught of none. …'You lay down and rest you,' I said. 'I knowed you are not sick. You're just tired. You lay you down and rest.'…And she was laying there, well and hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road, (37).

Here Anse describes his wife as laying down. He has already stated a theological idea that God made the road horizontal for traveling, and that other things made for traveling are horizontal as well, like snakes, wagons, and teams of oxen. He says that God made people to be in one place; this is why they stand vertically. This description of Addie as laying down, repeated four times within the paragraphs, feeds the idea of the road taking Addie away on a journey, away from Anse and the family through the medium of death. Just as the road brings Cash the desire to be a carpenter, it brings for Addie a desire to die and begin a new journey. Again then, the root of Addie's death is not just the simple road, but really the God who allowed the road to be built beside the house, consequently breaking His own rules.

As Faulkner develops his character and allows the reader to explore what Anse believes and sees about God, he moves away from Anse's complex theology and into the Christian myth of original sin and the sin-curse. In another titled chapter, Anse begins by saying: It's a hard country on a man; it's hard. Eight miles of the sweat and blood of his body washed up outen the Lord's earth, where the Lord Himself told him to put it, (110). Here Anse is referring to the sin-curse that God places on Adam and Eve, and consequently, all people, after they eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (from which they have been forbidden to eat). God curses Adam with the following: Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; and you will eat the plants of the field; by the sweat of your face you will eat bread, till you return to ground, (9). Here Faulkner toys with another paradox through Anse's words. God has told Man that he must labor with the earth to survive, yet through the supernatural power of the storm, God has undone all of the work and effort Man put into cultivating the land. As the family travels the eight miles to Jefferson, they are faced with destruction after destruction: bridges washed out and crops flooded and suffering. A mangled land that was carefully manicured by Man is now in complete disarray. God has cursed Man to toil with the land, but even after Man does toil with the land an prospers even a little, God washes away all of his hard work anyway with the storm.

Anse continues his soliloquy by discussing why a man would live off the land in such a fruitless fashion. He laments that the town people seem to prosper off his hard work while he never prospers. However, he finds comfort in that there is a reward for those who are hardworking, implying a reward from God of eternal salvation, blessings, and joy. He refutes this point by recalling a piece of scripture from the book of Matthew. Anse says, Every man will be equal there and it will be taken from them that have and given to them that have not by the Lord, (110). The problem with this scriptural recollection is that it is incorrect. The Matthew 13 passage is a quote where Jesus is teaching his disciples through parables. When questioned about why he teaches in parables, Jesus responds, For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him, (1386). Not only does Anse get the quote wrong, he gets it backward. The incorrect Biblical quote being wrong echoes the sin-curse myth: that despite all the sweat and toil that Man puts into laboring with the land, he will not be rewarded by the land. Likewise, it seems that no matter what kind of labor and effort Anse puts into being an honest, hardworking man, (110), he will not earn a reward. The people in the world who already are prosperous (here, Anse says the townspeople) will prosper more, and those who struggle and fight for a comfortable life will only have that taken away. There seems to be no blessing for the poor man, and justice is turned on its head as the rich prosper without ever having to work hard.

Despite Anse's belief that he will receive a heavenly reward someday for his toil, he does have some doubts about the validity of his hope. In the final two paragraphs of his soliloquy, Anse says that it seems bad that he should have to earn his reward by disgracing his family and dead wife through the journey to bury her. These inklings of doubt in his hope for some sort of salvation are finally echoed in his final scriptural recollection. I am the chosen of the Lord, for who He loveth, so He doeth chastiseth, (110). The scripture Anse recalls is a proverb that the writer of Hebrews later recalls in discussing the role of discipline in sanctification. This juxtaposition of the god Anse hopes will give him an eternal reward with a god who takes away from and disciplines those who have little creates a disconnect between Anse's god and the identity of God found in the text. The god Anse speaks of is the merciful, benevolent, saving-grace God of Christianity. However, the god deep in the text is an evil demiurge god who brings anger and wrath on the poor and needy, punishing all with the sin-curse given to Adam and Eve, yet allowing some to escape the curse at the sake of others who really deserve grace more.

When all of the puzzle pieces of Anse's theological ideas fit together, they create a unique image of the God he claims to believe in. The identity of God that Faulkner builds through Anse is not the one known to a young child in Sunday school. While Anse says that God is good, God loves him, and that God will take care of him, Faulkner uses Anse's language and philosophy along side of the circumstances of life to build a picture of God quite the opposite. This God Faulkner paints through Anse is one who deceives humans, causes them toil and pain, and has a skewed concept of justice. Faulkner portrays that God has unjustly made everyone pay for the sins of Adam and Eve, and that when people escape their curse by off-loading on others, God responds unjustly by prospering the prosperous and making life harder for the poor. He says that God has not been the faithful god of the people He promised to be; He breaks His own rules all the time, evidenced through the hardship of the poor, and allows people to suffer. Faulkner expects to find from life a god who will be grace and mercy and love, even for people like Anse who seem worthless. However, Faulkner communicates through As I Lay Dying that if that ideal god does exist, he has never met Him.",25.7,12.51,3.95,1.57,12773
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Absolute Necessity of College-Level Writing Courses,"Reading Mike Rose's article, The Language of Exclusion: Writing Instruction at the University only reaffirmed my pre-existing belief of the importance of writing and writing well. It also reaffirmed why I continue to have absolutely no doubt that writing courses should be nothing less than compulsory at universities and colleges. Institutions of higher education should not only continue to offer writing courses, but they should endorse and embrace the teaching of them. It is the higher educational institutions' responsibility and obligation to provide students with opportunities to improve their writing expertise just as it is their responsibility and obligation to provide students with a solid and well-rounded education in which writing plays a rather large role — whether it be a research university or not.

I believe that writing is a skill and I do not agree that labeling it as such should be considered the kiss of death. 1 It is common knowledge that universities and colleges teach principles and theories, but in most classroom situations, in order for students to convey to their professors and GSIs that they have grasped the principles and theories that they have been taught, they are required to utilize their skill of writing while taking exams and/or writing papers and they are expected to utilize it well.

Therefore, college level writing courses should be mandatory. By making them mandatory, students' writing skills would be elevated to the level that is necessary in order for them to do well in the classes that teach them the higher level principles and theories. In my opinion, by not making writing courses mandatory at universities and college, it is the student who receives the kiss of death. In today's college classroom, and in today's world, writing and writing well is a skill that is an absolute necessity.

Rose's article also states: to discuss writing as a skill, then, is to place it in the realm of the technical 2 as if the realm of technical is a bad or negative thing. No doubt, writing is technical, and is definitely a technique, but this is only one aspect of writing. Writing is also intellectual, and is, therefore, much more complex. To classify it as being only technical is reductive and incorrect.

I found it interesting that in Rose's article the academy, chose to make the statement that skill is nothing but a technique, something acquired differently from the way one acquires knowledge—from drill, from practice, from procedures that conjure up the hand and the eye activities 3 and then attempts to use a partial definition of the term from the American Heritage Dictionary (AHD) in order to justify and support their claim. But, there is a problem with their definition—it is incomplete. In the article, skill is defined as An art, trade, or technique, particularly one requiring use of the hands or body. 4 In other words, the academy took only what they needed from the AHD definition of skill to serve their purpose, which was to claim that writing is nothing but a technique that requires only the hands and body. Again, it is important to note that this is not the complete or whole definition, and, therefore, is inaccurate. Besides the former and partial definition, the complete and correct entry for the term skill in the AHD is as follows: Proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through training or experience, further, A developed talent or ability, such as writing skills. 5

What this complete definition of skill then means is that in order for one to gain an advanced degree of competence, and adeptness at writing, which includes mental as well as physical ability, one has to continuously practice it and develop it. This is just another reason why colleges and universities should offer their students writing courses. Regardless of the academy's attempt to relegate writing to the second-class and relegate it to the realm of the technical, writing is, and will remain, a key component to higher education whether the academy tries to classify it as technical or not.

I also believe that writing development is a continuum. But according to Rose's article there are many in the academy who do not agree. This fact is exhibited in the following statement: In the case of writing, the skills should be mastered before one enters college and takes on high-order endeavors….Yes, the skill can be refined, but its fundamental development is over, completed via a series of elementary and secondary school courses and perhaps one or two college courses, often designated remedial. 6 It is obvious from this statement what the academy is saying. And I disagree with several aspects of this claim.

First, I personally experienced very little writing instruction during my secondary education and I have witnessed the same with my two sons' secondary education as well, with the latter causing me great concern. It really wasn't until college that I was exposed to more rigorous writing requirements and found that in order to fulfill those requirements, further writing instruction and practice was needed. Second, I don't feel that because someone doesn't receive adequate instruction in writing during secondary school that they are illiterate and that the answer is remedial 7 English courses. How about dropping the word remedial and just calling them English or writing courses?

I have personally taken writing courses while at the University of Michigan—does this fact make me one of those who are [among] the truly illiterate? 8 I then must ask: if I am (or was) illiterate (because of my need and desire for further writing instruction) why did the University of Michigan offer me admission? The answer is simple: I am not illiterate, nor was I illiterate when I entered the University. All I needed was further, and better, writing instruction at the college level in order to successfully complete the college level courses and their requirements. In short, the two go hand in hand.

I submit to the academy's complaint that perhaps secondary schools are not fulfilling their part when it comes to writing. But this is and has been an ongoing problem and will not be easily solved — if it every really is. In any case, I firmly believe that the universities and colleges across this country have to face reality, address this issue head-on, and quit placing the blame and burden entirely on secondary schools. They also need to stop reducing writing to a second-class intellectual status or faculty, students, and society [will continue] to view the teaching of writing 9 as not their responsibility and the problem will never be truly solved.

I agree with Mike Rose when he states that it is a bitter pill to swallow when referring to writing as being reduce[d] to a second-class intellectual status 10 but I do not agree that we have little choice [but] to swallow it. 11 We do have a choice and by making every institution of learning, at every level, responsible for teaching and supporting the teaching of writing, the so-called language of exclusion will eventually become a dead language when it comes to the skill of writing.",51.73,37.99,21.81,23.01,7156
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,People or Property?,"In several of Shakespeare's plays, father – daughter relationships are defined primarily in terms of an ultimatum or a single function. In A Midsummer's Night Dream, Egeus attempts to force his daughter, Hermia, to marry Demetrius, as Egeus has promised Demetrius. When she refuses, he offers the option of the convent or death, effectually a non-choice. In Hamlet, Claudius continually tries to control Ophelia's interactions with Hamlet, either by forbidding her from seeing him or using her as bait in order to spy on the prince, and she is also given unappealing options that do not include being with the man she loves. In both plays, daughters are subject to the wills of their fathers and are treated more so as objects than as rational human beings.

A Midsummer's Night Dream opens with Egeus bringing a case against his daughter before the king. Egeus has given his consent to Demetrius to marry his daughter, but she refuses to consent due to the wooing of her by Lysander. Egeus confronts Lysander with:

With cunning hast thou flich'd my daughter's heart;
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness (1.1.36-38)

When Egeus refers to Hermia as my daughter, he is not only establishing their familial relationship with the word my; he is also indicating ownership. Hermia is his daughter not just because she was born to his wife, but also because he is in control of her. Her obedience belongs to him and him alone, and Egeus is enraged at the new stubbornness that Lysander's advances have planted in Hermia. Egeus, as Hermia's father, has promised her to another man, and Egeus refuses to allow his daughter to interfere in the dealing between two men: And she is mine, and all my right of her/ I do estate unto Demetrius (1.1.97-98). Although it may be Hermia's hand that is being given in marriage, it is only Egeus that holds to right to promise this hand, and he requests that the law be applied on his behalf:

I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this gentleman,
Or to her death, according to our law (1.1.41-44)

The very laws of Athens support Egeus in his view of his daughter as his possession, as an object subject to his disposal, and though these laws are framed as an ultimatum, there truly is no choice to be made.

Egeus' only presents two choices to his daughter: marriage to the man of his choosing or death. Death is not a reasonable option, though, leaving Hermia with no choice but to obey her father. After she pleads for pardoning of her boldness, Theseus does offer Hermia another choice, however, but not after reiterating that to her, her father should be as a god and that she should obey his will (1.1.46). Theseus tells Hermia that she is but a form in wax who has been imprinted by her father (1.1.48-49). Her image and her will are and should be aligned with and merely reflections of her father's. Hermia is not legally or culturally allowed to make her own decisions, but her eyes must with [her fathers] judgment look (1.1.57). The options that Theseus presents are not much more appealing. Though he does offer her the option to refuse to marry Demetrius, this refusal would result in her death or her taking the vows of a nun. Again, Hermia is given options that are merely variations on the same theme. Either choice that she could make would exile her from the man that she loves and the life that she is accustomed to leading.

Although Demetrius and Lysander are very similar men with very similar social standing, a fact that is admitted to by the king, one cannot be traded for the other. Because Egeus has promised his daughter to Demetrius, there is no turning back from this decision. Hermia cannot chose who she can marry, nor can she chose to refuse the man who has been chosen for her without facing serious consequence because she is not seen as an individual person capable of making her own decisions but as a commodity that can be bartered between two men. Demetrius requests that Lysander give up his pursuit of Hermia, with: Lysander, yield/Thy crazed title to my certain right, and Egeus speaks of estating his right to Hermia to Demetrius (1.1.91-92 and 97-98). Hermia is discussed in terms of property, as an object that has a title, or deed, that can be given from one owner to the next. By deciding her fate for her and refusing to give her say in her own future, the men in Hermia's life abolish her personhood, treating her instead like an object.

In Hamlet, Ophelia is given a bit more freedom in her actions, but she is still expected to obey her father's wishes. Though she is at first allowed to see Hamlet, when her brother and father notice that she is spending too much time with the prince, they confront her about it. As he is about to leave for France, Laertes reminds his sister that she is not of the same social status as Hamlet, and that, because of this, he may never be able to commit to marry her due to his required commitment to his country. This warning is not intended to protect Ophelia from a broken heart, however; it is to protect her from a scandalous reputation. Immediately after this goodbye scene, Polonius echoes the concerns that have been raised by his son:

Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you, and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
If it be so, as so ‘tis put to me,
And that in caution, I must tell you
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behooves my daughter, and your honor (1.3.91-97)

Polonius chastises his daughter for being too generous with her time in regards to Hamlet. Although he does not believe that Ophelia is actually in danger of compromising her purity, speculation and rumors are just as detrimental, and the behavior of his daughter is a direct reflection on his own social standing. Polonius reminds Ophelia that she is not acting as the daughter of Polonius ought to behave, and that she is not acting in a manner that reflects her honor. The order in which Polonius puts these two is reflective of the order of importance these aspects are to him. And your honor is placed at the end of his sentence, almost as if it were merely an aside, merely added at the last minute. While it may be important that Ophelia's honor remains intact and unsullied, to Polonius, this is only important so long as it is a reflection upon his own status and honor. It is not so important that Ophelia stays chaste and true to herself as it is that she stays true to the expectations that are required of a daughter of Polonius. Ophelia, like Hermia, is only viewed as an extension of her father, and Polonius uses this status of Ophelia as a near-object to glean information about the mental state of the prince.

After Ophelia obeys her father's wishes and refuses any more letters from Hamlet, Hamlet enters her room in a fit of enraged madness, and Ophelia obediently tells her father of this incident. Polonius confronts the royal family with a letter from Hamlet to Ophelia; a letter that she has given her father in her duty in obedience that comes from Ophelia belonging to Polonius as his daughter (2.2.107). The parents come to the conclusion that Hamlet's insanity is based in his love for Ophelia, and they plan to spy on a conversation between the lovers to confirm their suspicions. In the odd scene that follows, Ophelia is confronted by Hamlet in a state of madness, either genuine or feigned, and Hamlet offers Ophelia an ultimatum reminiscent of the one given to Hermia in A Midsummer Night's Dream. As Hamlet is attempting to drive Ophelia away by professing that he no longer nor has never loved her, he commands her to go to a nunnery (3.1.119). If this is taken as a literal statement and not as an innuendo for a brothel and, therefore, an insult to Ophelia's purity, Hamlet essentially tells Ophelia that since they can no longer see each other or wed, she is left only with the option to enter a nunnery and commit to a life of purity. When this option is not seen as adequate, or insulting, enough, Hamlet offers one more: to marry a fool (3.1.134). Like Hermia, Ophelia is left with no viable options; she cannot have the man that she loves, and she does not want to marry the alternative option or forsake the company of men forever.

Interestingly, though each daughter is offered a concrete set of options, at the conclusion of each play, each woman ends up making a choice that was not offered to her, but was offered to the woman in the other play. Hermia, after a night of magical madness in the forest, is allowed to marry Lysander, now that Demetrius has realized his bewitched love for Helena. Ophelia, after being driven mad by grief from the loss of her father and her lover, chooses death and drowns herself in the river. In the comedy of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the unexpected choice must be a positive one; the young lovers must end up coupled in exactly the right way. In the tragedy of Hamlet, Ophelia must meet a tragic end by choosing this tragic ending for herself. Even though both women are similarly objectified and controlled by their fathers and the other men in their lives, the genres in which they exist provide alternate ways out for each of them.

Hermia and Ophelia are both subjected to the wills of their fathers, brothers, kings, and lovers. They are presented with set choices that are not truly distinct options but merely variations on the same theme, and both must obey the wishes of the men in their lives. Both daughters are dehumanized and commodified, leading them to be viewed as merely extensions of their fathers and being used only to maintain or further the families' honor. When marriage to another's choice of man, death, or life in a nunnery are offered unappealingly, Hermia and Ophelia must create new and different options for themselves, bringing about rather different endings for both of the women.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,A (Solitary) Place For Fantasy in Reality,"Reality is composed of a rather tenuous fabric in the catalogue of fantasy novels we have explored this semester. The majority of this catalogue introduces a protagonist whose life is grounded somewhat firmly in the real world, but who also happens to encounter the fantastic. Unlike fantastic novels in which the protagonist is placed in a world that is wholly fantastic (that is, a world in which all characters acknowledge and accept the fantastic as being normal), fantastic novels set in reality require that measures be in place to preserve the laws of reality for the characters living outside of the protagonist's experiences. Were reality-based characters introduced to the concepts of the fantastic without the first-hand experience of the protagonist, the combination of ignorance and unfamiliarity would ultimately result in chaos. Thus, protagonists whose lives are set in reality must journey into or explore the fantastic alone (or in the company of fantastic creatures). Furthermore, to truly ensure the preservation of reality, once such protagonists return to reality, his or her experiences must easily lend themselves to realistic explanations.

In Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, for instance, the story is introduced with dreamy, rhyming verses that echo that of a child's lullaby or nighttime prayer in both form and content. The three tongues announce that, In fancy they pursue / The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new, / In friendly chat with bird or beast– / And half believe it true (no page). This verse encourages the reader to view Alice's journey to Wonderland as a curious dream before she even chases after the white rabbit (117). Thus, though the reader is never told that Alice has fallen asleep and begun dreaming, he or she is conditioned to fit her trip to Wonderland into a realistic framework. Dreams are, of course, a solitary activity as well, and so there is no way for Alice's sister to confirm or deny the actuality of Alice's experience with the fantastic. As a result, her sister does not have to confront or make sense of the fantastic; she is simply left to close her eyes and half [believe] herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality (117).

Similarly, in Marge Piercy's Woman On the Edge of Time, the reader is also set up to view the protagonist's journey into the fantastic through a realistic lens – that lens being Connie's diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hallucinations that result from schizophrenia are, like dreaming, entirely solitary experiences. Therefore, it is a convenient fact that there is Nobody around when Luciente appears to Connie (32). Her diagnosis, drug use, and solitary experiences with Luciente encourage the reader and the present-day characters around her to attribute her journey into the fantastic as solely a manifestation of her mental illness and habits – nothing more. In fact, if it were not for Connie's mental illness, Piercy's work would be an entirely different novel. The realistic explanation for Connie's experiences deters the introduction of superfluous complications in her already conflict-ridden world.

Tita's experience with the fantastic in Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate is slightly different than that of Alice and Connie, but the overall circumstances are deeply similar.

Tita's journey into the fantastic does not involve a trip to another land – instead, it is based on her emotions. Because she is forbidden to fully express her emotions until after Mama Elena and Rosaura's deaths, her journey into the fantastic is solitary. For instance, Tita experiences temporary blindness after seeing her sister's white wedding sheet; a sheet that causes her to think of a white church which she had never entered, without dreaming of the day she would enter it on the arm of a man (34). In the privacy afforded by the kitchen and Nacha's twin soul, Tita sheds a few tears for herself into the meringue icing. However, once she leaves this privacy for Pedro and Rosaura's wedding, she [makes] sure her face [does] not reveal the slightest emotion (36). Nacha's death keeps Tita's tears a secret, and the fantastic events that result from her emotions are explained by what her mother sees as a realistic, malicious act – adding an emetic to the wedding cake for revenge. Nacha and Pedro are, at times, privy to Tita's experiences with the fantastic because they drift in and out of being on the same emotional wavelength as she. Her experiences remain private, however, because Nacha has no desire to harm Tita (even in her death), and because Pedro is not allowed to openly express his feelings either.

Like Milo from The Phantom Tollbooth, who flops into his chair after school, looking for something interesting to do, protagonists based in realistic settings encounter the fantastic by themselves. In such cases, protagonists' fantastic experiences tend to be manifestations of their own desires for change in their lives. Alice seeks relief from her sleepy boredom; Connie seeks relief from her loneliness and isolation; and Tita seeks relief from her forbidden feelings about Pedro and her mother's control. All three protagonists find this relief, but the convenient, realistic explanations afforded by their solitary experiences allow them to return to an unshaken reality. Whether reality is a desirable place to return to seems to vary, but the fantastic can, at the very least, offer temporary respite.",0,0,0,0,5533
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Human-Animal Nature in H.G. Wells and Edgar Allen Poe,"H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau and Edgar Allen Poe's The Black Cat are both tales that explore human and animal nature. Both Dr. Moreau and Poe's narrator deviate from societal norms in their perspectives on human nature. As a result, both men live instinctually and compulsively. Unlike the liberty they allow themselves, however, Dr. Moreau and Poe's narrator view animal nature as if it were composed of malleable, brutish compulsions unworthy of man. The innocent animals involved in each story suffer needlessly at the hands of the two men. Both Moreau and Poe's narrator are aware of the pain they inflict upon the animals, but their personal interests and underestimation of animal nature motivate them to reject blame in every instance of abuse. Instead, the men identify external forces that motivate their behavior, placing blame on these forces rather than themselves.

The difference between Moreau and Poe's narrator, however, lies in the feelings each man has about the pain he inflicts. For instance, though Poe's narrator does not accept blame for tormenting Pluto, he does feel remorse for his actions. Moreau, however, views pain as an unnecessary response to necessary scientific research. This perspective does not produce any sort of remorse, since the study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature (Wells 115). Ultimately, though, whether he experiences remorse or not, each man's cruelty and misjudgment becomes his downfall.

In Poe's tale, the narrator reflects much on his perception of human nature. He describes, for instance, the humanity of feeling that he once possessed, a trait inherently linked to humane treatment of other living creatures (Poe 197). He does not, however, identify this trait as human nature. Instead, he describes it as being unusual and fleeting – a peculiarity of character (192). On the other hand, Poe's narrator declares perverseness – the feeling that motivates him to hang Pluto – to be [a] the primitive [impulse] of the human heart…which give[s] direction to the character of Man (194). This perception of human nature leads Poe's narrator to act according to his perverse impulses, rather than his ever-diminishing humanity of feeling. Conveniently, Poe's narrator avoids blame by placing himself at the mercy of human nature.

Moreau also shirks the responsibility of his actions, but rather than condense humanity into a series of irreversible traits, Moreau views humanity as a continuum; it extends from the most underdeveloped animal on one end, to the most advanced, God-like human on the other. This continuum is based on one's drive in life. Moreau is driven to seek the laws of this world's Maker…in [his] way to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living shape (Wells 114-115). Moreau's theory allows him to view himself not only as God-like, but also to justify his actions. Concurrently, this continuum also allows Moreau to view pain-driven creatures (whether they be animals or humans) as inferior beings with plentiful opportunity for improvement. As Moreau tells Prendick, But you see I am differently constituted. We are on different platforms. You are a materialist…so long as your own pain drives you…you are an animal (Wells 113).

It is here that Moreau and Poe's narrator face potential danger. Moreau's view of animals underestimates the strength of their natural instincts, causing him to believe (incorrectly) that he can conquer their stubborn beast flesh (Wells 118). He believes this despite his awareness of something [he] cannot touch…instincts…that harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst suddenly and inundate the creature with anger, hate, or fear (Wells 120). But Moreau ignores the implications of this realization – he is blinded by his self-inflated perspective on human/animal nature: his remorseless ego.

Similarly, in Poe's narrator's skewed perception of self-control, he incorrectly judges Pluto as a lesser being – an inconsequential outlet for his angry impulses. In fact, although Poe's narrator regrets killing Pluto, he does not expect any immediate repercussions for his actions – only those allotted to him in the afterlife (Poe 194). His disregard for the potential ramifications of his actions foreshadows his demise.

Moreau fails in conquering the strange hidden reservoir of animal instinct in the Beast Men, and his callous cruelty drives the pain-driven puma to lash out against his so-called research. As for Poe's narrator, his cold-blooded murder of Pluto seems to result in Pluto's reincarnation as a demonic brute beast. This physical product of the narrator's human nature seeks Pluto's revenge by bringing about immediate, real-world consequences for the narrator's lack of humanity.

While it is apparent in each individual story that cruelty to animals yields negative consequences, the pairing of the two works emphasizes this idea to an extreme level. Though it is important to examine the similarities Moreau and Poe's narrator share in their reasoning and actions, it is the difference between their settings that highlights animal cruelty as the undeniable basis for each man's downfall. For a greater contrast could not exist between Moreau's secluded, island laboratory and Poe's narrator's private, metropolitan residence. By recognizing the lack of influence this difference had on either story's outcome, it becomes apparent that no other factor – not setting, motivation, remorsefulness, nor personal justification – matters when animal cruelty exists as well. And so, in the face of better judgment (i.e., humanity of feeling), the men determine their own fates.",0,0,0,0,5645
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Pixels and Print: Effects of the Digital Age on Children's Literature,"The impact of the Internet and technology on children today is unavoidable: children are increasingly immersed in the digital world through a variety of media. One of my cousins, a happy eighteen-year-old living with Down syndrome, carries her Leap Frog Leap Pad everywhere she goes. When she first received the Leap Pad, she had been reading well below her grade level and hated how difficult it was for her to get through a book. The Leap Pad provided my cousin with an opportunity to see interactions with print as fun, exciting, and relevant: just as she loved watching her DVDs and playing computer games, she grew to enjoy her interactive storybooks. My cousin is only one of millions of children affected by the growth of the digital age in children's literature. The development of the digital environment, including interactive books, graphics, websites, games, movies, and television, has dramatically expanded the realm of children's literature and has influenced the way that children interact with reading and language.

Studies of the technology movement in children's literature began at the birth of the Internet and continue as technology becomes more and more applicable to different formats in children's literature. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Theory Into Practice magazine published a series of articles entitled Expanding the Worlds of Children's Literature. In one article, children's literature critic and technology analyst Eliza Dresang wrote about a way of thinking she titled Radical Change, a theoretical construct [that] identifies and explains books with characteristics reflecting the types of interactivity, connectivity, and access that permeate our emerging digital society (Dresang, 1999, 160). While children are still interpreting information through language, they are approaching these new texts with an expectation of connections and meaning that is much different from linear, traditional texts. Dresang explores such texts as David Macaulay's Black and White and The Stinky Cheese Man by Jon Scieszka, books that exemplify the interconnectivity of perspectives, plots, and meaning. Black and White is a four-paneled picture book that uses pictures and text to tell four stories with unlimited connections. The Stinky Cheese Man is a collection of scrutinizing challenges to classic fairy tales that requires the reader have an understanding of the original tales, of story structure, and of comedy. According to Dresang, the way in which children interact with text and meaning has also shifted with the literature they read: They are interactively and freely organizing information and making their own connections, not from left to right, not from beginning to end, not in the traditional straight line, but in any order they choose (Dresang, 1999, 162). Children have begun to own their reading, looking actively for meaning in places and frameworks that did not exist before the digital age.

The format of the classic children's picture book has also been challenged as a result of technology. The children's sections of modern bookstores are filled with more than bright colors and graphics; stores sell interactive books, books with characters from TV shows, portable audio books, books that come with stuffed animals, and books that talk back to the reader. In 1999, historian Gloria Skurzynski described the birth of a new kind of book, the portable electronic book that has screens rather than pages (Skurzynski, 1999, 179). She writes, They are easier to read than a laptop screen…and they advance one page at a time with a button push rather than by scrolling (1999). Certainly a technological leap at the time, these portable books paved the way for other book formats to emerge. Eight years later, children are clamoring for their Leapsters and Leap Pads, their books with interactive CD-roms attached, and books downloadable to their PSP or Nintendo DS. One educator compiled a list of technology tools that includes websites like BooksJust4Me and StoryPlace: The Children's Digital Library, which make it easy for children and parents to enjoy a children's story without physically turning the pages (Edyburn, 2007). The BookBox website, which guarantees Education and Fun, allows parents to download e-Books in a variety of languages at reasonable prices (Edyburn, 2007). Even Scholastic Inc. and other publishing companies have sections of their websites dedicated to interactive games with students' favorite storybook characters (Edyburn, 2007).

One format in particular has librarians and bookstores rushing to fill the shelves: the graphic novel. Bickers, asserting that publishing companies are taking what the students want to heart, writes, Graphix [a division of Scholastic Inc.] is arguably the first imprint dedicated exclusively to graphic novels for kids, but it is certainly no longer the only one (Bickers, 2007, 63). Publishers realize that putting words and pictures in a format that draws the reader through a story as if he was watching TV or a movie is an effective way to encourage students to read; graphic novels are now being used to retell classic literature like Beowulf or Oliver Twist as well as popular series like Babysitter's Club and the Hardy Boys (Bickers, 2007, 62-63). The Magic School Bus series by Joanna Cole, a favorite among both teachers and students, fills pages of scientific learning with speech bubbles, post-its, and compelling illustrations. While not technically a comic-style graphic novel, there is very little white space in a Magic School Bus book, and that's the way kids like it (Bickers, 2007, 63). In addition, the Bone comic book series by Jeff Smith, published into graphic novels for kids, is one of the most popular items in bookstores, libraries, and book fairs across the country (Bickers, 2007, 63).

There is no denying that digital interpretations of children's literature are being encouraged in a variety of places and media, but the effects of this digital hurricane are under the gun in research around the world. One research project proposed that preschoolers would benefit from digital read-alouds as opposed to the traditional print read-aloud. Not surprisingly, the project produced favorable results. Researcher L. Collen summarizes her interpretation of one of the project's results: That children in the traditional storytimes asked no picture-based questions and children in both digital storytimes did ask picture-based questions suggests that…the digital storytimes may have resulted in an enhanced understanding of the story, based on an enhanced visual experience (Collen, 2006, 14). In imagining a class of preschoolers in front of a large screen, one does not need to ponder long on how enthralled the students would be with the enlarged graphics. After all, many preschool-aged children have already been exposed to television and other media. The question remains whether the students were asking questions because they noticed more, or whether the traditional read-aloud format did not adequately encourage these kinds of questions.

Continued research and reflection will be necessary if teachers, parents, and society at large wish to determine whether the immersion in digital media that is occurring in schools and homes across the country—and the world—is benefiting our youth. Undoubtedly, the world is becoming more inter-connected with the evolution of the Internet and an exponential increase in communication. Children are clamoring for texts that are graphically appealing and have an element of technology, whether it is a website they can visit, a game they can buy, or an attached CD-rom. Books themselves are changing both in format and in content to meet the increasing demand for interconnectivity, and children are changing as they interact with text in multi-directional, multi-media ways.",0,31.74,9.06,5.75,7870
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"Historical Places, Violent Spaces: A discussion on violence, personhood, and space in Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts","Virginia Woolf's last novel Between the Acts is, more than anything else, a comment on contemporary society and how individuals function within that structure. She uses the house of the Olivers and the small-town pageant to provide a microcosm of the pressures and issues that existed in pre-World War II England. Both the characters and the house, the main focuses of the novel, have their own history of class and culture and attempt to distinguish themselves among the influences and voices of the past. Each character has a way of negotiating the pressures of the past; what the narration becomes is a portrait of people's acceptance of and resistance to their own individual chains of destiny—specifically regarding cycles of violence in history. In Between the Acts, the concept of space acts as a vehicle through which a study of character formation and the difference between individual assertions of place and the ways that history, culture, and one's own past limit freedoms of self-assertion.

The concept of space is introduced through the form of the house at which the reader finds the main characters preparing for the annual pageant. The house is described to belong to the Olivers who have only owned the house for a mere a hundred and twenty years. 1 The space is represented as having a history that predates the occupation by the current family, a fact which becomes important as the reader is further exposed to the idiosyncrasies of the Oliver house. Attempting to create a meaningful history for the family and the house, the narrator leads the reader up the principle staircase…[to] a portrait…and ancestress of sorts (Woolf 7). This image of a grand staircase leading up to a commanding matriarch immortalized in a portrait implies a rich and important past. Most importantly, the reader is told that the butler had been a soldier…and, under a glass case there was a watch that had stopped a bullet on the field of Waterloo (Woolf 7). The Oliver lineage is proven to be not only worthy of the house that predates their occupancy, but also worthy of the honor and respect that accompanies those who can be proven to be contributors to England's noble military history. And as the description of space can impart notions of the importance of history and participation, it can also convey ideas about the issues of contemporary politics and the uncertainty of the importance of the individual.

As the reader crosses the threshold of the library along with the narrator, it is relayed that a foolish, flattering lady once declared that Books are the mirrors of the soul (Woolf 16). But Isa enters the library, glances over the many books inhabiting the shelves, and realizes There they were, reflecting. What? What remedy was there for her at her age—the age of the century, thirty-nine—in books? Book-shy she was, like the rest of her generation; and gun-shy too (Woolf 19). There is a discordance between the space of the library and the woman who enters; Isa, in her modern, newspaper-dominated reality, does not truly belong in an environment dominated by Keats and Shelley. Isa, along with her generation, is unable to harmoniously reconcile the traditions of the past with pull of the present. The evolution of English culture that led to the importance of the newspaper also led to a hesitance to participate in world politics, referenced by the generation being gun-shy and supported by the contemporary resistance to entering the war by Britain. Just as space can imply the idiosyncrasies of a generation, it can also suggest impressions of individual issues and emotions.

And as the library evokes feelings of a culture, so the dining room elicits the feeling of individual austerity:

The room was empty. Empty, Empty, Empty; silent, silent, silent. The room was a shell, singing of what was before time was; a vase stood in the heart of the house, alabaster, smooth, cold, holding the still, distilled essence of emptiness, silence (Woolf 36-7)

Woolf embodies the room's emptiness in the language that she chooses to describe the vacant space. Her reiteration of the words empty and silent creates the illusion of an echo; the reader can almost hear the words bouncing around the shell of the room. The repetition of the s sound also instills the feeling of silence and emptiness in the reader—as if the echo continued but petered out until only the s of silent remained. Woolf's description of the dining room as a place this sterile, and cold communicates the emptiness at once felt by most of the occupants of the house. Because the dining room should, according to convention, be a room that is warm and filled with people and food, the lack is especially striking. The reader truly feels the isolation of each individual within the house, and more abstractly within history, suggested by the empty, cold room. And just as Woolf looks to the spaces to evoke certain emotions, she also looks at space as a means to convey social and political issues, mainly the struggle for an individual assert herself amid the din of societal expectations and gender norms.

As the dining room is readied for lunch, the reader's attention focuses on the two paintings that hang together in the room: The lady was a picture the man was an ancestor. He had a name…He was a talk producer, that ancestor. But the lady was a picture (Woolf 36). The man in the painting has a story, a name, and even his animals have names (Colin and Buster); the woman, however, remains a woman devoid of both a personal and legendary history. As if to truly emphasize this dichotomy between history and lack thereof, Woolf furthers, He was a talk producer, that ancestor. But the lady was a picture (Woolf 36). The ancestor provides the viewer with a subject, some sort of content that constitutes a story. The woman in the painting remains silent, without a story, without a name. It is also important to note that while the ancestor, in the narrative imaginings of his life, is dismayed that there is only space enough for one of his animals, the woman has plenty of space in her picture, her frame consisting of her person and a silver arrow prop. This contrast of space represents the different circumstances in which men and women have created, or were prohibited from creating, history. Although the lady has plenty of physical space to create a narrative in her painting, she does not—her voice is absent from her own story. At the same time, the ancestor almost forces his history on the viewer, shouting loudly of the unimportant animal compatriots. These two paintings and the spaces that they portray is indicative of woman's struggle throughout history to have her voice heard.

When Between the Acts was still Pointz Hall, Woolf included a few poems that speak to, among other concepts, the emotional realities of a few of the characters. Poem two, specifically, speaks to an inability to completely remove oneself from one's history, both personal and public. Woolf uses the metaphor of the single burdened donkey in the midst of a caravan, unable to speak with a single strong and authentic voice. None speaks with a voice free from the vibrations of the old voices in the dark caverns. 2 In using the idea of a single member lost not only in a group of compatriots, but also in the plane of history, Woolf explicates exactly how each person is, in space, a mere reflection of the past, guided also by the pressures and conventions of those who accompany an individual in society. People are forever haunted, and influenced, by the voices that remain from speakers past. In acting not by their own volition, but instead by their inability to break with conventional gender compulsions, or rather, what society dictates each person—male or female—should do, many of the characters assume the role of the burdened donkey, unable to significantly move fast or far enough from what came before. This inability to break with convention is most poignantly reflected in Giles and Isa's strain, but ultimate failure, to ignore the norms of their gender.

In a very emotionally charged scene of impulsive violence, Giles instinctively stamps on a snake in the midst of swallowing a toad, killing them both. Creating the scene for the reader, Woolf presents Giles kicking a stone, a barbaric stone; a pre-historic (Woolf 99). She asserts that stone-kicking was a child's game, a contention that gives Giles an impulsive, childish air (Woolf 99). By aligning Giles with child-like, barbaric, or pre-historic tendencies, Woolf is placing an emphasis on innate or natural inclinations; she wants to convey Giles as a man who acts according to impulse, much like children, who have yet to be influenced by societal pressures. As he observes the two animals, Giles sees the snake in the process of swallowing the toad and so, raising his foot, he stamped on them (Woolf 99). By using the word so, Woolf projects an almost logical causality to the sequence of Giles' actions; the so implies a necessary consequence of the observation. The implication of logic in the destruction of the two animals is indicative of Giles' inability to break with his masculine, and sometimes violent, persona. And although he struggles throughout the novel with his safe, banker image in a climate of combative soldiers, in this scene, Giles reclaims his maleness by demonstrating his facility with strategy and action: a necessary component of the ideal soldier.

As Giles is stuck in the prescribed expectations of masculinity, so Isa remains bound in the strictures of womanhood. While Giles proves his manhood in a scene of violence, Isa fulfills her role as a woman by remaining loyal to her husband and children, although her desire to do so is not exactly clear. The reader is introduced to Isa's character in the initial scene of the novel, as a woman concerned with the actions of a man who is not her husband. As she stares at this other man, she thinks on how her webbed feet were entangled by her husband, the stockbroker (Woolf 5). Isa clearly feels as though she is trapped in her marriage to Giles, and yet unable to really disentangle herself and leave. She feels constrained by her position, and throughout the novel, she is constantly trying to convince herself that staying with Giles is good and necessary. Isa creates a mantra that she repeats throughout that becomes a sort of justification of her decision to remain stagnant in her role as Giles' wife: namely that Giles is the father of my children (Woolf 14). At this point, for Isa and Giles, it is clear that love is not really a contributor to their marriage; rather, Isa and Giles maintain a distanced respect that Isa justifies with her constant repetition of Giles' role in the family. She stays with Giles because he fathered her children, children for whom her love is even questionable; she stays because she must.

Isa's inability to challenge the male-dominated system is also manifested in her reflections on Giles' infidelity. As Isa sits in the audience, she watches her husband… [and] she could feel Manresa in his wake (Woolf 110). Ultimately, Isa muses that it made no difference; his infidelity—but hers did (Woolf 110). Though Woolf ultimately does not believe there should be a discernable difference between the standards for men and women, she resigns herself that there is a palpable gulf between accepted behavior for each of the genders—especially concerning familial obligations. Isa permits her husband's infidelity because he represents the provider in the relationship; additionally, without Giles, Isa would not even be present at the Oliver home or pageant. In this perpetuation of expected gender interaction, Woolf's idea of the burdened individual resonates resolutely. Isa is burdened by society's conception of a good mother and wife, and her well-being and happiness necessarily suffers. Clearly, she has at least thought of breaking free of her familial fetters, but inevitably always convinces herself otherwise. By allowing Giles' indiscretions, and refusing to challenge or even object, Isa is complicit in the perpetuation of a conventionally gendered society—she becomes complicit in her own oppression.

Isa's complacency is even more palpably felt in her response to Giles' bloodied tennis shoes. Unlike Mrs. Manresa, Isa does not valorize Giles' act that leaves his shoes bloodied, but she also does not have a particularly adverse reaction to the sight either. Rather Isa dismisses the act of violence with the thought, Silly little boy, with blood on his boots (Woolf 111). In failing to question Giles' actions, or even the motivation for his actions, Isa contributes, perhaps unknowingly, to the continuation of the cycle of violence. By absenting herself completely, Isa participates in and confirms the worth of a male-dominated system of aggression and violence. As MacKay asserts in her examination of Modernism and war:

In the novel's sheltered world of village pageants, bazaars and cricket matches, Giles' bloodstained tennis shoes are a powerful emblem of the fall from innocence that comes from reacting with violence to violence. More than that, they speak of Woolf's own fall from innocence in accepting that it was no longer possible to be an Outsider, as she had advocated in Three Guineas, attacking patriarchal instincts and institutions from the radical margins: insiders and outsiders, Giles, Isa, William and Miss La Trobe, are necessarily in it together.  3

This concept of female complicity in the cycle of violence is relatively new for Woolf. She postulates in this last novel that women are not as far removed from the responsibilities of active citizenship as she had previously thought. No longer can women be seen as persons distinctly outside the political arena; men—and women—as a whole are involved in the realities of war and violence, even if as an individual one is not committing the acts himself.

Unlike Isa, Ms. La Trobe presents the reader with a strong, assertive personality that challenges the domesticity and submissiveness of her gender. But though La Trobe does occupy the role of a strong, assertive woman, it is imperative that the reader keep her actions in context. La Trobe is directing a yearly pageant in a small town that is not only unsuccessful, but also downright silly. What with the mishaps, forgotten lines, and the poorly-timed downpour, Miss La Trobe's pageant is a dud. Not to mention that the entire production of the pageant seems a bit futile; in the context of the impending war, the pageant seems a relic of more innocent times that do not quite fit with the climate in Britain. Admittedly, if done well, the play could have been a patriotic affirmation of the small town's love for their country, but considering the state of the actors, and the success—or lack thereof—of their acting, England, personified, is somewhat ridiculous. As Phyllis Jones opens the play, and repeatedly declares, England am I without continuing, the reader gets the sense not only that the country's fate is in limbo (this novel was written as England was deciding whether to get involved in the war or not), but also that La Trobe is cannot entirely escape from the relegation of the woman to a role silly and futile either.

This idea of the individual versus his own and the collective past can most poignantly be seen in the last scene in the novel. As Miss La Trobe plans her next play, Isa and Giles find themselves alone, acting almost entirely within the bounds of La Trobe's imagination. The action appears scripted, as if the two are not behaving of their own accord, but rather on the directions of the play. The language used: Before they slept, they must fight; after they had fought, they would embrace implies an inevitability to their performance (Woolf 219).

This last novel of Woolf's represents a move away from her earlier work in which her philosophy always seemed to be resolutely on the side of women's Otherness at the hand of men. In Between the Acts, Woolf gives a view of an equal responsibility of subjugation to both genders, intimating that both men and women contribute to the perpetuation of gender norms. This last novel represents Woolf's legacy and Bloomsbury's [as] the unfinished and unfinishable fight for civilization—peace, freedom, art, beauty, sociability—that they hand on to the later generations of the whole world. 4 Writing Between the Acts in tandem with a biography of Roger Fry, Woolf is forced to revisit the past and look back into her own personal history. She discovers that the space that we create is indicative of our emotions, our history, and ultimately, our failures. Woolf understands, as she observes England making the same political mistakes, and as she re-examines her life vis-à-vis the life of Fry, that while perseverance may not always bring change, it is necessary for the eventual evolution of society.",0,0,0,0,16932
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Bloom & Martha: Are You Not Happy in Your Home?,"The reader, after trudging through the strange stream-of-consciousness and reference-heavy prose introducing her to Stephen and Bloom, finally encounters Martha's straightforward letter in Lotus-Eaters. The letter, at first, comes as a welcome change—as the reader easily digests the simple prose, free of difficult allusion. Martha's letter, still early in the narrative, proves a lotus-like escape for the reader, just as s/he assumes that this affair must provide some kind of escape for Bloom from his faulty marriage to Molly.

Only after reading on in the novel does the reader learn the duplicitous nature of this letter's straightforward prose—that whenever Joyce offers her something easy to digest, it surely can't be so. Just as Father Conmee's simple and repetitive prose betrays his self-obsessed and delusional nature and Gerty MacDowell's cliché-ridden section demonstrates the influence and control advertising and popular culture hold over her identity, the reader should not approach Martha's letter as a narcotic escape from the difficulty of the text. Similarly, while Bloom and Martha's epistolary affair might at first seem an exciting escape from his faulty marriage, both Bloom's immediate treatment of the letter and the reoccurrences of Martha's words throughout the text imply that the affair works no better as an escape for Bloom than for the reader—it actually confronts him with his actions in light of the his struggling marriage to Molly.

On first reading, the letter's unadorned prose proves refreshing, but many of Martha's syntactical and grammatical errors betray her awkward bravado. Martha's trip-up, I do not like that other world, (substituting world for word) for example, could, with a Freudian slip, refer to the real world—outside of the couple's fantasy relationship. And even if Martha's slip up holds no significance for her own situation, it certainly holds plenty for Bloom's, whose other world crumbles throughout the day. Additionally, the letter seems made up of sentiments alternately sad and longing, and tawdry and flirty—making the flirtation appear difficult and somewhat pitiful. Martha's are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? exhibits this perfectly. The question are you not happy in your home? feels poignant and especially pertinent for the day, but Martha's calling Bloom a poor little naughty boy reminds the reader how much this letter operates as a performance. Thus, the flirtation complicates the question—seemingly asking, is that why we're doing this? Because you aren't happy in your home? Additionally, several of Martha's truncated sentences seem to omit words that might truthfully speak to how difficult her situation, and Bloom's marital situation have actually become. When she writes, I feel so bad about, she could potentially refer to her relationship with Bloom, or perhaps, how this affair reminds the two of them of that other world, and how their lives have pushed them into an affair with no substance beyond little black marks on paper. And later, when Martha tells that I have such a bad headache. today, the setting aside of today, if not speaking to Martha's struggle with grammar or her own day, reminds the reader how much more poorly June 16th is going for Bloom than just a simple migraine could indicate. Though the simple prose of the letter proves refreshing, many of Martha's words and errors still complicate it for the reader—within the context of Bloom and Martha's relationship—when s/he takes a closer look.

Though Bloom's covertness in picking up and disposing of Martha's letter suggests its importance—he feels the letter far too steamy and private to risk any discovery—his emotional reaction to the letter renders the affair more inert and benign. The supposed affair only takes place on paper—and that likely will never change. Bloom seems somewhat happy with the message, but only  weak joy opened his lips, not a more pressing or intense emotion (emphasis added). And just following, Bloom pokes fun at Martha's poor grammar, as he wonder[s] did she wrote it herself (64). He obviously thinks of himself as intellectually superior to his correspondent, thus assuaging any of the reader's suspicion that he and Martha share a deep cerebral bond. On that account, it appears as though Bloom intends to keep the affair innocuous; as he remembers Martha's offer to meet one Sunday after the rosary, he thinks, thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage(64). He would rather keep the relationship in the realm of the imagined. Bloom treats the letter with weak joy, gentle mockery, and vague disinterest upon first reading it, indicating the innocuous nature of his affair. At this point in the narrative Bloom's still might view the affair as, like a good cigar, narcotic. Go further next time…try it anyhow (64). However, as Martha's words resurface again and again, the reader sees how many more complicated ways they can work in, and also how Bloom's affair with Martha keeps him from escaping thoughts of his marriage, but rather encourages his return to them—just as he will eventually return home.

In Lestrygonians, the language from Martha's letter resurfaces in Bloom's thoughts, further complicating the content of her letter for the reader and demonstrating how for Bloom, the affair works terribly as an escape. When Bloom remembers his younger love with Molly in Lestrygonians, and how when we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy, he wonders, would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? (137). The resurfacing of his letter from Martha jars the reader. It reminds her that Bloom, while pining for his past with the cuckolding Molly, has explored—to a far lesser extent—a certain degree of infidelity himself. At the same time, though, the language helps Bloom to ask this question of himself, and even in its asking, answers itself: of course not. This reminder of the tawdriness of Bloom's affair seems to clarify for the reader Bloom's longing for a real relationship and connection with Molly, his wife.

Bloom comes back to the letter more frequently in Sirens, and understandably so; the clock moves closer to four, Boylan comes into the bar, and Bloom's thoughts circle around infidelity as he decides to write Martha back. As Boylan walks into the bar, and Bloom mentally tries to put the man down, thinking he can't sing for tall hats, and imagines Molly being perfumed for him, again Martha's words come back to him: what perfume does your wife? I want to know (225). If Bloom thinks about Martha's letter in an effort to distract himself from thinking about Boylan and Molly, the effort fails. His thoughts return to his wife's affair: Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door (225).

Later on in Sirens, when Lionel sings Martha, Bloom recalls his own Martha's words again: can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you a naughty boy (226). Here the prose moves in a truncated fashion, and Martha's words form the only full sentence in the paragraph, excluding Bloom's  Martha it is, and his exclamation at the end, how strange! Again, the closer and closer it gets to four, the more Bloom can't concentrate on anything but his wife's pending affair with Boylan, to the extent that he can't write (226). Additionally, though, the truncated style of prose reminds the reader how Ulysses constantly complicates, churns around, and repeats its own material. Martha's originally simple letter now finds itself wrapped up into the percussive prose of Sirens—refusing a simpler first reading. The sentences shortness might also come because as Bloom tries to write Martha back, he obviously struggles with the act—and with trying to mouth one thing and write another. Just as the affair proves no escape for Bloom, Bloom's thoughts and the complex and shifting prose of Ulysses complicates the reader's encounter with the affair as well. In articulating this struggle, the book won't release full sentences or words: my patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe (230).

However, Bloom's admitting to his struggle to write Martha back—if even in this thoughts—seems to display how his epistolary relationship with Martha has the ability to extract some truthfulness from him. At the end of the letter, he even manages to write, I feel so sad today (230). Though he obviously still performs this sentiment, and second-guesses himself moments later, Bloom's admission to Martha serves as one of the most honest communications Bloom has all morning. The relationship, a failed escape, brings Bloom face to face with the true difficulty of his situation and his day.

If the reader sympathizes significantly with Bloom in Sirens, s/he likely does less so in Nausicaa, when Bloom's infidelity becomes more active and tangible as he masturbates to Gerty MacDowell. Bloom again recalls Martha's words, as he writes a message in the sand: I, he writes, then thinks what is the meaning of that other world. I called you a naughty boy because I do not like. AM. A (312). Bloom, of course, never finishes his sentence. Just as he almost defines himself by scrawling a declaration in the sand, his thoughts again trace back to Martha's letter. This time, though, his recent encounter with Gerty complicates the memory. Now he truly has done something naughty, which likely contributes to his struggle to define himself. Bloom drops his writing tool in the sand, no room. Let it go and the narrative winds on. Again, the complicated nature of Ulysses—which could never release in direct, simple language what Bloom actually is—regurgitates Martha's words, using this piece of her letter to remind the reader how far the text can travel.

Bloom, more directly associates his encounters with Gerty, Martha, and his wife when, after Gerty has drained all the manhood out of [him], he remembers writing Martha care of P.O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling (308-309). Coming immediately after this recollection, Bloom's thoughts again turn to his wife. He thinks of: Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house, the occasion when, as the reader learns from Molly in Penelope, he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth (615). In this passage the reader encounters the complicated ways that Martha's letter resurfaces, as s/he cannot actually understand the full significance of Bloom's Dolphin's Barn ponderings until the final chapter in the book. Though Bloom's thoughts hint towards the Dolphin's Barn encounter earlier on in the text in Calypso (52) and Lestrygonians (130), the reader never fully comprehends the encounter, if they even ever make the connection, until Molly describes it in Penelope. Thus Molly's assertion regarding her kiss with Bloom, I couldnt describe it simply, could work as a synecdoche both for how Martha's letter—and the book as well—work: Joyce lets nothing, not Martha's letter, not Bloom and Molly's relationship, stay simple, or stagnant throughout the text. Martha's letter resurfaces in complex and unpredictable ways. Here, it challenges the reader to bring together two seemingly inconsequential details; Bloom's relationship with the two women hinges on this Dolphin's Barn Lane location.

Every time Bloom writes to Martha, or receives a letter from her care of the Dolphin's Barn Lane post office, he likely remembers this heart-kiss with his wife. Just as masturbating to Gerty MacDowell fails to provide an escape for Bloom, each letter to Martha care of Dolphin's Barn Lane must necessarily remind him that his relationship with Molly no longer makes him, or her, feel like nothing on earth. And Bloom seems to realize this a few moments after he remembers that night of charades in Nausicaa, when he ponders how [you] think you're escaping and run into yourself (309). Both his epistolary affair with Martha and his masturbation to Gerty remind him of the complicated and imperfect state of his marriage. And this line could just as well apply to the reader—who first encounters Martha's letter with relief, feeling it an escape—but later reads the resurfacing of the words with more confusion and difficulty, running into herself, as s/he learns that nothing in Ulysses stays as simple as it first seems.

In parallel to the way Bloom wanders Dublin, at first avoiding and then returning to his home, Martha's letter at first seems to provide escape, but eventually returns him to thoughts of his marriage. The reader of Ulysses, too, must constantly establish and reestablish a home, or place of comfort within the text. Driven away from the kind of reading s/he is accustomed to, the reader must find new ways of approaching the repetition, truncated prose, and references that demand ongoing reinterpretation of Martha's letter's place in the text—among other thoughts and events. Failing to explore many of Ulysses' complexities might leave the reader feeling like a tourist—seeing the sights but never fully understanding them. But to encounter the book as an object both shifting and static, and to explore the narrative both as familiar—with a plot line, characters, and a setting—and foreign—in which the relationship of the reader to the text constantly cycles and shifts—creates a home like Bloom's: a challenge to get to, but rewarding upon arrival.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Women in Beowulf,"Equality is a highly regarded goal in today's society; laws are designed to ensure equal treatment of all people, across different socioeconomic, ethnic and gender classifications. Along with the aim of gender equality is the goal of reaching equality through identical treatment of men and women. This modern mindset may influence a reader's perception of the power held by the women in Beowulf. On the surface, Queen Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother are dominated by men. However, both women actually have a great deal of power; it is simply manifested differently than the power of male figures.

Queen Wealhtheow initially seems to be a powerless woman dominated by the men around her. The reader is first introduced to Wealhtheow as she passes a cup around to the men, in the role of hostess. The fact that Wealhtheow is serving the men makes it seem as though she is subservient to them; however, this is not the case. Wealhtheow is not merely doing the men's bidding; rather, she is fulfilling the necessary tradition of recognizing a complex social hierarchy. It is her responsibility to serve the men, as a show of respect, in the correct sequence,

 Wealhtheow came in,
Hrothgar's queen, observing the courtesies.
Adorned in her gold, she graciously saluted
the men in the hall, then handed the cup
first to Hrothgar, their homeland's guardian,
…so the helming woman went on her rounds,
queenly and dignified, decked out in rings.
offering the goblet to all ranks
treating the household and the assembled troop,’
until it was Beowulf's turn to take it from her hand. (lines 612-624)

If Wealhtheow were to disregard her duties as Queen by not serving the men in the correct order, they would be offended. By following her responsibilities, Wealhtheow is maintaining peace and stability among her people.

Wealhtheow herself wants the best for her people, as seen in lines 625-628, With measured words she welcomed the Geat / and thanked God for granting her wish / that a deliverer she could believe in would arrive / to ease their afflictions. Wealhtheow is not being forced by a man to fulfill her duties; rather she does so out of her own desire for the well-being of her kingdom. Wealhtheow, with the intent of protecting her kingdom and family, wields her power in a couple of different ways. Not only can she wield her power by promoting peace through her complex role as hostess, but she also uses the power she has as a queen to warn the men about Hrothulf.

In a society where honor and respect are so important, it would be unheard of for Wealhtheow to overtly challenge the motives of a powerful male ally. However, within the social constraints she is bound by, Wealhtheow warns her people about Hrothulf. With her clever speech, she attempts to secure the safety of her sons and kingdom, by drawing attention to Hrothulf and entreating Beowulf to monitor his actions. Unlike the men around her, Wealhtheow does not appear blind to the possibility of Hrothulf's betrayal, …Wealhtheow came to sit / in her gold crown between two good men, / uncle and nephew, each one of whom / still trusted the other... (1161-1164). The men's trust for each other is explicitly stated, however, nothing is said of Wealtheow's trust. It is with ulterior motives that she does mention her faith in Hrothulf in her speech,

I am certain of Hrothulf.
He is noble and will use the young ones well.
He will not let you down. Should you die before him,
he will treat our children truly and fairly.
he will honor, I am sure, our two sons,
repay them in kind, when he recollects
all the good things we gave him once,
the favor and respect he found in his childhood. (1179-1186)

As queen, Wealhtheow is given the opportunity to make speeches to the public; she chooses to use this power to try to protect her sons, while the king does not. Wealhtheow's speech is a reminder to Hrothulf that he has an obligation to treat her children fairly. She even goes as far as to explicitly reference Hrothulf's debt to repay the kindness he has been given. Wealhtheow makes the speech in a public forum so everyone, especially Beowulf, will be reminded of the behavior expected from Hrothulf. Wealhtheow does not have the physical strength to protect her sons; however, she makes every attempt available to her to secure their safety. Ultimately, the reason Hrothulf is successful in his usurpation is because the men fail to recognize and act upon Wealhtheow's warning.

Although Wealhtheow's presentation of gifts to Beowulf may seem to signal his dominance, the gifts are actually a further indication of Wealhtheow's power. She contributes more to the likelihood of a positive outcome for her people than the king or any other male does, by bestowing these vitally important gifts on Beowulf. The first gift Wealhtheow gives, the torque, is a sign of commitment and trust between her people and the Geats. She knows Beowulf is a powerful ally and that, by binding her people to Beowulf, she is increasing the kingdom's strength. Wealhtheow gives an important speech as she presents the gifts to Beowulf,

Take delight in this torque, dear Beowulf,
wear it for luck and wear also this mail
from our people's armory: may you prosper in them!
Be acclaimed for strength, for kindly guidance
to these two boys, and your bounty will be sure.
You have won renown: you are known to all men
far and near, now and forever.
Your sway is wide as the wind's home,
as the sea around cliffs. And so, my prince,
I wish you a lifetime's luck and blessings.
to enjoy this treasure. Treat my sons
with tender care, be strong and kind. (1216-1227)

Wealhtheow flatters Beowulf in her speech, to endear herself to him. She knows Beowulf is a powerful ally and that it would be in her kingdom's, as well as her sons', best interest to be in his favor. She has the same motivation for giving him the torque. Wealhtheow's gift of the mail is evidence that she is also a powerful ally who can offer Beowulf protection. In fact, without the chain mail, Beowulf would not have been victorious in his later battle against another powerful woman, Grendel's mother.

Like Wealhtheow, on the surface Grendel's mother appears to be dominated by male figures. In fact, she is eventually killed by Beowulf. However, when examined more closely, it is clear that Grendel's mother is a very powerful figure in her own right. Like Wealhtheow, she has a strong desire to do what is right for her son. Grendel's mother apparently lived peacefully for many years and never attacked Heorot, until she decided to protect her son's honor and seek revenge for his death,

grief-racked and ravenous, desperate for revenge.
She came to Heorot. There, inside the hall,
Danes lay asleep, earls who would soon endure
a great reversal, once Grendel's mother
attacked and entered. Her onslaught was less
only by as much as an amazon warrior's
strength is less than an armed man's
…Then in the hall, hard-honed swords
were grabbed from the bench, many a broad shield
lifted and braced; there was little thought of helmets
or woven mail when they woke in terror.
The hell-dam was in panic, desperate to get out,
in mortal terror the moment she was found. (1278-1293)

Grendel's mother is clearly powerful enough to inspire grave fear in the warriors. She is not free of fear herself, yet she is courageous enough to risk herself to achieve her goals of getting revenge for her son's death and honoring his memory.

Grendel's mother succeeds in getting revenge against the Danes, especially King Hrothgar, when she seizes Aeschere,

She had pounced and taken one of the retainers
in a tight hold, then headed for the fen.
To Hrothgar, this man was the most beloved
of the friends he trusted between the two seas.
She had done away with a great warrior,
ambushed him at rest. (1294-1298)

It is not a coincidence that Grendel's mother takes Aeschere, the King's most trusted advisor; Beowulf is not present, thus Aeschere is the next best victim. Grendel's mother is clearly victorious in her attack, even though she is far outnumbered by the men.

Grendel's mother protects her son's dignity and honors his memory by reclaiming his arm, There was uproar in Heorot. She had snatched their trophy, / Grendel's bloodied hand. (1302-1303). Although her feelings toward her son urge Grendel's mother into battle, it is ultimately her decision to attack Heorot. During the attack, she proves her physical superiority over the men and manages to take two worthy prizes; the king's favorite man and the arm of her son.

Grendel's mother is eventually physically dominated, when she is killed by Beowulf. However, Beowulf is only triumphant because of contributions from both Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother. Beowulf initially tries to slay Grendel's mother using only his own resources, however his sword fails,

The hero observed that swamp-thing from hell,
the tarn-hag in all her terrible strength,
then heaved his war-sword and swung his arm:
the decorated blade came down ringing
and singing on her head. But he soon found
his battle-torch extinguished; the shining blade
refused to bite. It spared her and failed
the man in his need. It had gone through many
hand-to hand fight, had hewed the armor
and helmets of the doomed, but here at last
the fabulous powers of that heirloom failed. (1518-1528).

Even though Beowulf has used his sword to kill many men in the past, it is no match for Grendel's mother. Her power is too great to be conquered by Beowulf and his weapons alone.

Grendel's mother gains the advantage in the battle and is about to kill Beowulf, when he is saved by the armor given to him by Wealhtheow,

 The sure-footed fighter felt daunted,
the strongest of warriors stumbled and fell.
So she pounced upon him and pulled out
a broad, whetted knife: now she would avenge
her only child. But the mesh of chain-mail
on Beowulf's shoulder shielded his life,
turned the edge and tip of the blade.
The son of Ecgtheow would have surely perished
and the Geats lost their warrior under the wide earth
had the strong links and locks of his war-gear
not helped to save him… (1543-1553)

Were it not for Wealhtheow's gift of protection, Grendel's mother would have succeeded in killing Beowulf. Her power was great enough to cause Beowulf's death; however, the strength of Wealhtheow's gift prevented her from doing so. Beowulf is able to finally overcome Grendel's mother only after he steals her sword, Then he saw a blade that boded well / a sword in her armory, an ancient heirloom, (1557-1558). Beowulf cannot defeat Grendel's mother with his own assets; he must steal a sword from her realm.

The narrator credits God for Beowulf's success, rather than recognizing the women's contributions. Yet, it is unlikely that God would have anything to do with providing the sword Beowulf uses to kill Grendel's mother. Beowulf found the sword in the evil realm of Grendel's mother, which is a place God does not have any association with. Therefore, although Beowulf caused Grendel's mother's death, his strength is still overshadowed by the power of the women. Beowulf needed the protection of the armor given to him by Wealhtheow, as well as the strength of the sword that he stole from Grendel's mother, in order to be victorious.

Although it superficially seems the women do not have power equal to that of the males, in reality the issue is much more complicated. These women are not weak figures dominated by men; rather they wield much power in the lives of the men around them. Wealhtheow helps maintain the stability and peace of her kingdom, while doing her best to provide protection to her people. Grendel's mother exerts a great deal of physical power, but also gets revenge for her son while protecting and honoring his memory. These accomplishments may not be seen by the modern reader as typical displays of power. However, while the power of Wealhtheow and Grendel's mother may manifest itself in a different fashion than that of their male counterparts, its existence is undeniable.",0,0,0,6.69,12041
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Love Covenant,"The book of Hosea presents a different view of God's relationship with Israel than many of the previous books. The extended metaphor employed in Hosea 2: 2-4 portrays God as Israel's husband, but, more precisely, its spurned lover. This metaphor lays the foundation for a new portrayal of God's covenant with Israel, a covenant of love, which is detailed throughout the book.

The metaphor of God as Israel's lover highlights a new sense of the relationship God has with his people. The God in this passage (Hosea 2: 2-4) is not the unfeeling and indiscriminately violent God presented earlier in the Bible. One example of this earlier idea of God is in Genesis—And God said to Noah, 'I have determined to make an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence…now I am going to destroy them along with the earth' (Genesis 6: 13).

In contrast, Hosea's God is intimate with Israel—Plead…that she put away whoring from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts… (Hosea 2:2). The metaphor makes God very human-like and his jealous anger can be understood in the realm of human emotion. His anger is notably softer than pervious accounts where God would simply strike down any offenders. For example, in the book of Exodus, God tells Moses, 'Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book…I will punish them for their sin…' Then the LORD sent a plague on the people… (Exodus 32: 33-35).

In Hosea, God's anger is also passionate; the lines in Hosea suggest an image of a man whose passionate love is mixed with passionate jealousy as he remembers the look of his lover's face and the shape of her breasts. The memories are soft, but deeply painful as the husband laces them with their new marks of sin—his lover turns into a promiscuous wife as her face becomes whoring and her breasts cradle adultery. His violence is also intensely personal. Rape imagery is employed as the spurned lover threatens to strip her naked and expose her in order to punish the wife's sins (Hosea 2:3). This is no longer a God who dictates and punishes from above at a removed distance, but one who wishes to make Israel suffer for its crimes.

The punishment outlined for the adulterous woman parallels the slow way God will punish Israel. This punishment is of abandonment—make her like a wilderness—and of slow death—turn her into a parched land, and kill her with thirst (Hosea 2: 3). The metaphor turns God into the angry man who finds out his wife has taken other lovers and then systematically outlines the detailed ways of his vengeance. He is so angry that he will even dismiss his children in order to punish her. Upon her children also I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom (Hosea 2: 4). However, it is exactly this intense and detailed jealousy which illustrates the love between the man and the woman, between God and Israel. If he did not love so deeply, so passionately, he would not be so offended or take the time to punish so thoroughly.

In this way, the metaphor of God and Israel as lovers sets up the covenant as a covenant of love which is prevalent throughout the book of Hosea. This covenant appears different than past representations of God's covenant with Israel. In Exodus, the covenant stated that Israel needed to heed God's commandments. In Hosea, the covenant seems less specific and more human; God desires steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings (Hosea 6: 6). This covenant requires that the Israelites love God steadfastly without becoming adulterous and loving other gods.

Hosea's metaphor certainly reestablishes the idea of the covenant as one of love, but it is unclear why this new covenant is expressed here or why it is important. It does seem important to Hosea to weave together the old ideas of the covenant with this new covenant about love. He seems to want to unite the previous notion of a wrathful God with his new version of a loving God, and the text vacillates between the two. At one point the text reads, ...therefore the tumult of war shall rise against your people, and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as…when mothers were dashed in pieces with their children (Hosea 10: 14). Very shortly after the tone of God changes drastically—I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love (Hosea 11: 4). The text is silent about how these two different portrayals of God actually fit together.

Again, it is unclear why the covenant in presented as one of love in Hosea. One idea is that the book of Hosea is trying to reinterpret the covenant so as to end the repetitive cycle of the Israelites breaking covenant which exists throughout the Bible. In a way, it seems as though Hosea realizes that the original presentation of the relationship between God and Israel has a history of failing, and it may be helpful to create a new version of that relationship. Hosea attempts this by making God more human-like and giving him human emotions that the people would be able to understand. The employment of the lovers metaphor also allows the Israelites to understand their relationship with God by basing it off human experiences with love.

Going along with the idea of strengthening a covenant that seems again and again to be too weak is Hosea's idea that love is the strongest bond. This book may be seen as Hosea's final effort to bond the Israelites to God before Israel is taken. Hosea may see the use of love then as the motivation needed to inspire the people to stay with God. With the old covenant it was necessary for Israel to fear punishment for abandoning God. However, this punishment was God's wrath and destruction. Hosea employs a much more powerful fear—the fear of losing love. The threat now is not that God will just be angry, but that he will hate them, will drive them out of [his] house, and will love them no more (Hosea 9: 15). Losing someone who once loved them is much worse than losing someone who never loved them.

The need for this love covenant may also have grown out of what was going on at the point in time Hosea was a prophet. In the first covenant between God and Israel, the people had been suffering under Egyptian rule and God had brought them out of slavery. They had nothing and relied on God to protect them. However, at the time of Hosea, it appears that the Israelites are doing fairly well. They have established themselves on their land and are no longer poor. A God who can provide for them may not seem as necessary; it may be easy for this generation to forget God since they no longer need to ask him for help.

So then in order to bring the Israelites to God, Hosea may use the idea of love since one can endlessly aspire for love. In the original covenant, the people asked for and God provided them manna, but here the people need to strive for his love. There is no longer something concrete and tangible to receive from God, but something abstract. When the Israelites received the manna, or whatever else it was they desired, it was easy then to forget God. However, since they can never truly know if they have God's love, they must work for it forever. Love may be the strongest motivation for action and Hosea uses it to his advantage.

The love covenant may also be presented here to inspire repentance among the Israelites. In the past, the notion of covenant has been absolute. If the people obey God, he will protect them. If the people disobey God, he will abandon or destroy them. If the people come back to God, he will return to them. However, the covenant in Hosea does not seem to be so concrete. The book presents the idea of needing to heal one's relationship with God, just as a husband and wife would work to heal a problematic relationship.

The important twist in this idea of healing is that it is God who creates the wound by taking away his love, but also happens to be the only one who can heal the wound by returning his love. This is pointed out in Hosea: When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound (Hosea 5: 13). In this way, the love covenant leaves no room for other Gods or other kings if the Israelites wish to be healed.

The blurred lines of this covenant allow for temporary punishment that may inspire repentance. Much like the angry husband who cannot help but still love his adulterous wife, God will also take back his people. They seem to know that it is he who has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck down, and he will bind us up. After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him (Hosea 6: 1-2).

The strongest part of the covenant may be that in this idea of covenant God never truly abandons his people; even though he threatens to deny them love, he cannot do so. This may be more effective in motivating the people to admit their sins and return to God then if they thought of God's anger and abandonment as absolute. The promiscuous wife will be more inclined to return to her husband if he is temporarily angry then if he cuts her off completely.

It is uncertain why the book of Hosea employs this idea of the covenant between God and Israel as a covenant based on love. However, while there are confusion and holes in the text, it seems that Hosea does present the idea of the covenant successfully or persuasively. The first metaphor of God and Israel as lovers creates the foundation for the ideas and human emotions that course through the rest of the book. These ideas then expand into even greater metaphors about God's love covenant that seem almost too big to be contained by the small book of Hosea. The successful presentation of the covenant as love rests on an important ending in Hosea. The lovers reconcile. I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them. I will be like the dew to Israel… they shall again live beneath my shadow (Hosea 14: 4-7).",0,30.7,17.08,19.81,10018
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,An Artistic Composition of Hell,"Stephen's visualization of Hell is juxtaposed with its traditional description provided by the Catholic Church in Chapter Three of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. These two detailed versions are paradoxically similar and dissimilar at the same time. Both destinations are characterized by: repetitive diction; the torment of the sinner's visionary, auditory, and olfactory senses; open-mouthed images of the damned, their eternal murmurings, foul stenches, and suffocating filth (122). The principle difference between the two versions is that the Church's fundamental focus on eternal punishment utilizes physical torture, which, interestingly, Stephen's Hell completely lacks. While the idea of an eternity with physical torture is understandably frightening to his peers at Clongowes, Stephen's Hell is far more personal and intellectually gruesome; its imagery is borrowed from his past experiences and serves to aggravate his innermost horrors. It appeals to unconscious fears that, for him, supersede physical pain: the soiling of something otherwise innocent; mental and physical paralysis; and his family's impending poverty. For Stephen, all of these obstacles are fatal to the obsessively scripted life of his imagining—which is his greatest fear of all. His visualization of Hell can be viewed as a detailed composition of imaginative art that is ultimately a personal triumph over both the oppressive Church and his greatest fear.

The pastoral imagery of the landscape and its creatures is fundamental to Stephen's vision of Hell and unquestionably echoes the cowyard scene in chapter two when he sees for the first time a field empty of the cattle which had seemed so beautiful(63). He laments over the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung (63), and defines his sudden feelings of revulsion towards cattle as to the point that he could not even look at the milk they yielded (63). Stephen's visual and olfactory accounts of his Hell deeply mirror that of this cowyard scene, describing the landscape as: A field of stiff weeds… Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of solid excrement and stale crusted dung (137). Also strikingly similar between these two scenes are the animals referenced: cattle and goats—both of which are pastoral animals that produce milk. The presence of the goats in Stephen's Hell correspond to the revulsion experienced in chapter two with the defilement of the cattle which he originally found beautiful. Both scenes speak directly to his fear of the otherwise pure and innocent becoming spoiled and dirty. This concept has profound resonances of Catholicism and proves to be a constant struggle for Stephen throughout the novel due to his rigorous Catholic upbringing.

The goatish creatures' importance extend beyond their representation of spoiled innocence. There is a marked significance behind the repetitive and counterproductive nature of their rhythmic motions: essentially movements and shapes that have no endpoint. To emphasize this, Joyce utilizes onomatopoeia to name and describe the endless hither and thither motion—a motion that continuously reverses its previous movement and thus lacks progress. Consequently, this motion signifies both eternity and paralysis. To add to the stagnation, this winding hither and thither phrase describes the individual movement of each creature within the more uniform yet still futile movement of all six creatures collectively in slow circles (thus, still lacking progress and finality). The phrase hither and thither is reused often throughout the remainder of the book following Stephen's vision of Hell. It is generally his own unconscious reference to his current state of paralysis: either mental as on page 161: a din of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly; or physical as with his inability to approach the seabird girl moving her foot in the same fashion at the end of Chapter four. This paralysis of thought and action is yet another obstacle that Stephen struggles with during his childhood and adolescent years.

The remaining details of this composition are the initially puzzling images of a torn flannel waistcoat (138) worn by one of the goatish creatures and the two references to battered/rattling canisters (137/138). While their presence is seemingly inappropriate in a destination such as Hell, these images are meaningful if the Dedalus family's fast-approaching poverty is taken into account. The nature of the material is important; flannel is known for its ability to sustain warmth, thus originally making it popular among blue-collar workers in cold environments, such as farmers. Also significant is the quality of the waistcoat, being in a torn and weathered state. Furthermore, the scanty clothing is mirrored by the animal that wears it: a farm animal, thus also alluding to blue collar individuals--possibly more specifically to the impoverished state of Irish farmers during the period in which the novel takes place. When the waistcoat is coupled with that of the dump-like presence of rattling canisters, the reader can understand that these images are indicative of Stephen's fear of poverty.

Stephen's vision of Hell is a triumph for him for various reasons. First, he has triumphed over the Church, freeing himself of the images and fears they attempted to forcefully instill in him and instead fearing only that which is relevant to his life. Secondly, it is an artistic triumph, as his composition--though less violent--is insurmountably more eerie and terrible than the theatrically trite version provided by the preacher. Finally and incredibly ironically, Stephen's composition is in fact a triumph over his greatest fear itself. His Hell is comprised of obstacles capable of spoiling the carefully controlled life scripted in his mind. In imagining such a place, Stephen has succeeding in scripting, and thus controlling, all that he fears most.",0,0,0,0,6027
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Role of Nicholas Levin in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina,"Though the appearances of Constantine Levin's brother Nicholas in Anna Karenina are limited to a handful of scenes depicting his rapidly declining health and eventual prolonged death, their dramatic intensity and the lasting impressions that they leave on Kostya render them memorable and key to the progression of the novel nonetheless. Tolstoy employs Nicholas's fiercely liberal, communist-leaning political stances and his frequently radical intellectual and social viewpoints as a rather convenient vehicle for commentary on Russian society. Yet even more salient to the novel as a whole is Nicholas' role in prompting his brother's recurring existential contemplations of G-d and death and the way in which his demise ultimately functions to facilitate a deeper, more intimate union between Kitty and Levin. Kitty's proclivity for dealing rationally and comfortably with imminent death while her husband stands by, horrified and practically helpless in his cerebral contemplations of the situation, arouses poignant feelings of love and respect within Levin. Furthermore, on a more technical level, the revelation of Kitty's pregnancy coincides directly with the moment of Nicholas' death, thus completing a life-cycle of sorts within the novel. Nicholas' role in Anna Karenina gains its significance most prominently from the impact of his life on Kostya, as he possesses a unique ability to disturb [Levin's] innermost thoughts, (316) serving as a muse for his philosophical ruminations, compelling him to acknowledge the inextricable ties between life and death, and aiding his quest for the discovery of meaning in human existence.

Tolstoy introduces Nicholas quite early on and wastes no time in depicting him as a difficult, standoffish, somewhat repellent character, and moreover a ruined man who had squandered the greatest part of his fortune, mixed with the strangest and worst society, and quarreled with his brothers (24). No sooner does Nicholas gain his first mention in the novel than he becomes a source of mental anxiety for his brother Constantine, who because of Nicholas begins to feel that [He] cannot be at peace since a struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present, and the consciousness that this would be wrong(24). Though at this point Levin temporarily casts aside the thought of Nicholas as he prepares to visit with Kitty, his brother soon resurfaces in his mind when Levin asks himself is he not right that everything on earth is evil and horrid? (77). Thus the gloom permeating Levin's mind as he thinks of his pessimistic brother prompts him to look harshly upon the world with dark-colored glasses and temporarily integrate a dose of Nicholas' negativity into his own perspective. These periods of negativity are a key phase of the maturation process that Levin undergoes during the novel, and only by traversing through can he emerge triumphant in the glories of life by the book's end. Levin notably expresses a degree of sympathy for Nicholas and even compares himself directly to his unfortunate and oft-ridiculed sibling, noting that, I know his soul, and know that we resemble on another (77). The function of this comparison is twofold, as it initially forges a meaningful connection between the two brothers and thereby highlights for the reader the fact that Nicholas will play a vital role in Levin's story, and then it further inclines one to pity Nicholas and look upon him more kindly because he is juxtaposed directly with one of the novel's more reputable and upstanding characters. Levin's dedication to defending his brother as no worse than those who despised him (78) grants Nicholas credibility, paving the way for him to considerably influence the course of events in the book.

Tolstoy contributes to the pathos of Nicholas' character through his use of physiognomy, describing his eyes with their peculiar, naïve gaze which light up with joy upon recognizing his brother, and his generally awkward, blundering manner (80). He also relates that Nicholas has taken in a former whore, Mary Nikolaevna, to live with him as his wife, and while this action does not increase the respectability of his image, it does show that he is a man not altogether lacking in compassion, for he demands that those who wish to know him must love and respect her (80). During his first meeting with Nicholas, Constantine tellingly admits to himself that his brother is unfortunate and needed friendship (83) and subsequently vows that he will never allow himself to forget him again, but would watch over him, keep him in sight, and be ready to help when things went hard with him (85). This revelation on Levin's part forecasts the extent to which Nicholas' tragic story will come to affect Levin. Many of the details accompanying Nicholas' various appearances in the novel paint him in a disagreeable light, yet because of Kostya's consistent efforts to identify with his brother and vindicate his characteristically abrasive behavior, one cannot easily dismiss Nicholas as simply an embittered misanthrope, but rather must instead give him due attention as a relevant and purposeful character, and one whose life resonates with many of the novel's most crucial themes.

Nicholas remains characteristically present in Levin's mind even after the latter's return to Moscow, when remembering his brother Nicholas, he begins to reflect on communism and the state of the economy, resolving in light of the vast economic disparities he perceives between peasants and landowners to, work still more and allow himself still less luxury (85). In this moment the seed that will become his book about the nature of the laborer in agriculture begins to germinate, and his determination to work in the fields among his peasants rather than live idly off of their labor gains substantial momentum. These resolutions are integral to Levin's character and remain central to him throughout the novel, continually influencing his behavior. Here they have their impetus in his considerations of former conversations with Nicholas, thus revealing that the influence of Levin's brother lies at the core of his developing social and moral ideology. Later encounters with Nicholas will also precipitate evolutions in Levin's thinking process. A few months after this first episode, when Nicholas arrives to visit Levin at his estate, Levin initially worries that Nicholas, who knew him through and through…would force him to make a clean breast of things, but upon actually greeting his brother, his feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity (316). Thus Levin privately acknowledges Nicholas' powerful sway over him and admits that he fears the extent of his brother's influence, but because he is promptly consumed by pity and compassion when confronted by the emaciated figure of his ailing brother, he ultimately cannot escape this profound influence. In accordance with the recurring pattern that manifests whenever Levin spends time with his brother, his mind plunges deeply into thought the night after Nicholas' arrival, and he lies awake nearly all night contemplating death, the inevitable end of everything, bemoaning that I want to do something, and I had forgotten that it will all end in Death! (318). As the novel's human embodiment of misfortune and death, Nicholas' presence haunts Levin because he does not yet know how to integrate suffering and death into his ideas about life. Nicholas repeatedly spurs Levin into profound contemplations, forcing him to confront difficult and often moribund topics that might not otherwise occupy his thoughts, but Nicholas' demise will eventually give Levin the opportunity to synthesize key notions of sickness and death into what he already knows about life. Thus while in this instance Nicholas' poor health and nearness to death confound and distress Levin, sending him spiraling into philosophical deliberations on the new, insoluble problem of death (319), Nicolas will ultimately provide philosophical resolution for Levin through his passing, and death will evolve from an insoluble problem to a natural part of life.

These ruminations on death and the impenetrable problems of life echo the end of the novel, when Levin comes close to suicide because he cannot find a suitable system of beliefs to endow his life with meaning. The crisis of existence that Levin undergoes in the novel's final chapters, culminating with his discovery of true faith, has its roots in these earlier scenes when the presence of Nicholas provokes a strong intellectual response within him and commands him to address serious themes of death and G-d. Levin concludes his visit with Nicholas by thinking, there is little to be happy about in this world and, he saw death and the approach of death in everything; but the work he had begun interested him all the more, (321) aptly demonstrating that through just one brief visit, Nicholas has induced him to reformulate his entire perspective on life, death, and work. Nicholas has such distinct influence on Levin that his very existence can profoundly alter the very way in which his brother views the world. In a sense Nicholas also serves as an intellectual muse for Levin, a source of inspiration to which he can turn to fuel his ponderings. Because Tolstoy ties Nicholas' character so closely to the specter of death, he implies that by extension, death itself is a muse for Levin. Yet whether the muse takes the specific form of an abstract entity or an earthly being, it propels Levin onward as a man of ideas in Anna Karenina. As he constantly occupies himself with some item of philosophy, Levin owes much of the motivation for these cogitations to Nicholas and everything that he represents.

It is not only Levin who reacts strongly to Nicholas, for we see that Kitty's first encounter with Nicholas at the Wells inspired an irrepressible feeling of aversion in her, as she observed his large dreadful eyes, which followed her insistently [and] expressed hatred and irony (197). When she accompanies Levin to Nicholas' deathbed her feelings rapidly change, and she then feels pity for the invalid, experiencing, a need for action, for finding out all the particulars of his condition, and a desire to help him (449). In either case Kitty's response to Nicholas substantiates even further the potent impact that he has on Levin by reinforcing his status as a polarizing and thoroughly penetrating character that leaves a lasting impression on those who cross his path. At the deathbed it is Levin who feels horror and repulsion, choking with sobs and unable to utter a word (450). The reversal of roles and attitudes in this scene carries major significance because it causes Levin to understand that Kitty knew surely what death was…knew without a minute's hesitation how to behave with the dying and did not fear them, while Levin and others like him who were able to say a great deal about death, evidently did not know anything, for they feared it and had no notion what to do when people were dying (450). Levin comes to realize that however virile his mind, however much he might know about death from his readings, and no matter what questions on the subject he might be intellectually able to confront, nonetheless he remains pragmatically helpless, for G-d has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes (451). Not nearly so bogged down in the mire of heady ideas and existential concerns as her husband, Kitty experiences none of the resulting paralysis that so plagues Levin when the time comes for action. She thus gains a new level of respect and appreciation from Levin as he observes her remarkable ability to tend to Nicholas confidently and sensibly, addressing not only his physical but also his spiritual needs, and he comes to recognize that all she did was well done (452). Levin sees her in a new and favorable light in the days leading up to Nicholas' death, and this evolution in his view of her brings them closer to each other. Originally having rejected Kitty's request to join him at his brother's side, claiming you will be in my way (442) and annoyed that perhaps she loved him too much, Levin now experiences an intense upwelling of emotion after watching Kitty excel at her work for a few days and seeing how quickly his brother was able to find comfort in her presence while he himself was at a loss for what to say and do. He tells Kitty quite genuinely I am very, very glad you came. You are purity itself, (453) and in this moment Levin and Kitty unite to connect on a deeper level, all of which is occasioned, albeit indirectly, by Nicholas. The novel's intricate connections between life and death are on display again here, for by helping him to address the question of death Kitty increases her value in Levin's life. Similarly, it is in his time of death that Nicholas makes his final and most enduring contribution to Levin's life. Furthermore, an assertion of love for Nicholas (“because he loved the dying man more than the others did, Levin felt that lie most painfully (456)) precedes Levin's subsequent declaration of love for Kitty, as though Levin needed to affirm to himself his love for his brother and accept the pain of his death as a natural part of life before declaring later in the chapter the potent and inexplicable nature of his love with Kitty.

Nicholas' death renews in Levin's soul that feeling of horror at the inscrutability, nearness, and inevitability of death, but these thoughts do not drive him to despair as they have previously, because in spite of death, he felt the necessity of living and loving. He felt that love had saved him from despair, and that that love under the menace of despair grew still stronger and purer (459). Levin loves Kitty even more at the moment of Nicholas' death than he has before, because he realizes that her love possesses a preserving power which has kept him afloat when he was in danger of drowning in his despondency. There is little question that Levin and not Kitty will wind up the novel's hero, but this does not fundamentally devalue the importance of her role in this particular episode. Levin has his wife to thank for sustaining through her presence and support his very capacity to live and to love in the face of death and confusion, and he owes an equal debt of gratitude to Nicholas for providing the very menace of despair that allows his love to grow stronger and purer. Without Nicholas' suffering and death to give a physical form to Levin's moribund intellectual despair, he would have been deprived of the opportunity to forge a closer bond with Kitty. This new sense of togetherness between Kitty and Levin quickly gains a physical manifestation when the doctor confirms Kitty's pregnancy, prompting Levin to muse, scarcely had the unexplained mystery of death been enacted before his eyes when another mystery just as inexplicable presented itself, calling to love and life (459). A life-cycle progression comes full circle, as one life ends only for another to begin -- sickness and death unexpectedly heralding of birth and new life. By placing Nicholas' death and the announcement of Kitty's pregnancy in immediate sequence within just a few lines of each other, Tolstoy suggests that Nicholas may have traded his life for that of Levin's child, thus completing a circle of mystery for Levin and helping to teach him how to love. This direct juxtaposition emphasizes to Levin that he need not fear death and can instead incorporate it organically into his conception of life, as the two are forever connected. The irony inherent in the fact that one of the more spiteful and loveless characters in the novel actually plays a large role in bringing two other characters together and introducing thoughts of love and new life into their minds only enriches Nicholas' unexpected role.

In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy molds and develops his secondary characters with dexterity; each one plays a critical role in the book no matter how few pages s(he) may actually traverse. Constantine's invalid sibling Nicholas Levin appears in only a handful of scenes before he vanishes entirely about halfway through the novel, yet because of the ways in which he represents death and the commanding influence he has on his brother, his effect on the book extends far beyond the limits of his physical presence. Functioning, among other roles, as a catalyst for the unification of Levin and Kitty and as a starting (and ending) point for Levin's frequent philosophical and ideological contemplations, Nicholas leaves an indelible stamp on Anna Karenina as he is paradoxically integral to the development of both the book's themes of love, life, and death.",0,0,0,0,16800
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Grey Zone of Shame: The Drowned and the Saved,"The Drowned and the Saved is a very different endeavor compared to Primo Levi's other writings about the Holocaust. Both Survival in Ausweitz and The Reawakening take place in the moment of action – in the Lager – and were written soon after the experience. By contrast, Levi wrote The Drowned and the Saved in the 1970's. With the additional time and some emotional distance, The Drowned and the Saved directly discusses the issues that were depicted in Levi's previous novels. Writes Levi, the novel contains more considerations than memories (Levi 35).

Specifically, Levi explains the ambiguousness of morality, guilt, and shame. He calls this the grey zone.

The grey zone appears to describe a (fittingly) broad set of actions and ideas. On the surface, the grey zone demonstrates the absence of a clearly demarcated line between good and evil. Levi feels that the desire for simplification (37) is justified for the young, but this concept of true heroes and villains is a literary fantasy that cannot be realized in real life. Levi describes the moral disintegration that struck almost everyone: life in the Lager involved a regression, leading back precisely to primitive behavior (39).

As evidence for this transformation, one may examine the treatment of new prisoners by the established veterans. Levi writes, Rarely was a newcomer received… as a companion‐inmisfortune. Rather, in the majority of cases, those with seniority showed irritation or even hostility… [the newcomer] was envied… derided and subjected to cruel pranks (39). How can one reconcile these actions with the tremendous guilt that follows? Levi argues that the reaction of those in the Lager, while barbaric, was a natural human reaction given the situation. He defends, The prisoners of the Lagers… represented an average, unselected sample of humanity (49). Essentially, Levi makes a statistically based, scientific argument to defend the actions of the prisoners. Since the prisoners of the Lager represented a true cross‐section of humanity, it can be extrapolated that any other representative sample would have reacted the same way. Thus, their behavior was rigidly preordained as the vectors and instruments of the system's guilt (49).

The grey zone becomes cloudier when one considers the actions of the privileged prisoners. Levi's description of the kapos is drenched with resentment, these prisoners instead of taking you by the hand, reassuring you, teaching you the way, throws himself at you, screaming in a language you do not understand, and strikes you in the face. He wants to… extinguish any spark of dignity that he has lost and you perhaps still preserve (41). Yet, Levi concedes, in general, [the privileged] are poor devils like ourselves (44). Indeed, privileged prisoners were also those responsible for the most daring and successful revolts in the camp. It also should be remembered that Levi himself was a privileged prisoner for working in the chemical kommando. However, the members of the chemical kommando were never charged with harming or controlling other prisoners. But what if they had been? Would Levi have reacted the same way as the Einsatkommandos, who slaughtered Russian civilians under orders (31)?

This inability to truly judge one's own actions, this relative morality, is the grey zone.

How, then, can one judge the kapos? Levi seems to place the kapos perilously at the edge of the grey zone. Their actions are more deliberate, more conscious – more evil – than the other prisoners. The difference is that once given power they took it upon themselves to seek more and assert it. In doing so, many kapos began to emulate the Nazis, power was sought by the man among the oppressed who had been contaminated by their oppressors and unconsciously strove to identify with them (48). That places many kapos outside of the grey and the realm that the Nazis occupy – that of the truly guilty.

From the grey zone, Levi observes two phenomena that emerge: the shame of the victims, and the distortion of the memory of the perpetrators, a falsification of reality, [a] negation of reality… to protect the conscience (31). Though Levi advocates an understanding of this grey zone through relative morality, that does not mean that one should refrain from judgment. For this reason, Levi does not allow the Nazi perpetrator's entry into the grey zone: The majority of the oppressors, during or after their deeds, realized that what they were doing or had done was iniquitous… but its suffering is not enough to enroll them among the victims (59).

Indeed, there is a line, that when crossed, is most certainly evil. But one of Levi's most crucial messages in The Drowned and the Saved is that the prisoners (with few exceptions) did not cross this line. Levi stresses with great urgency that the prisoner's errors and weaknesses are not enough to rank them with their custodians. The victims of the Holocaust were human beings placed in an inhuman environment. For their actions, however bad, they should understand and reflect, and perhaps feel some shame, but not guilt. The real crime was the Holocaust in itself.",0,0,0,0,5139
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Individuality and Isolation in Defoe's Moll Flanders,"Moll, in Defoe's Moll Flanders, is a female character who, curiously, seems to lack maternal instinct, who abandons her children time and time again and shies away from ever creating or being a part of a traditional family unit. The traditional female roles of belonging to the private sphere, of maintaining the home and staying out of public affairs is still a standard in the early 18th century. But Moll entirely defies this convention; her wishes are externalized, her personal will made known from the first few pages of the novel. Her methods of obtaining money force her out into the world. She is constantly interacting with others, practicing a sort of employment that, though illegal, resembles a trade. Her thievery gives her a reliable income and puts her into the public sphere. Her externalization is, for the time, characteristically masculine; her livelihood does not consist of raising children, but of making business in the world. This recurring masculinity in the portrayal of Moll's character suggests a woman of a new era; the 1800s become an era in which the first cinders of feminism are kindled. But along with defiance of convention and female masculinity come the consequences: Moll remains, throughout the novel, an incredibly isolated figure. Each interaction she has with other human beings falls almost immediately, in most cases, to economic exchange. By her very external actions defining her character, the idea of family and companionship solely for human interaction and interpersonal connection is barely emphasized. The psychological, her inner life, is suppressed. The lack of any psychological probing by Defoe even isolates Moll, in certain cases, from us as readers. Defoe's Moll represents a changing age, one in which people are not entirely products of their circumstances and family, in which the individual becomes increasingly more valued over the ties of duty and kinship; her isolation is the product of not belonging to any particular group, but to herself.

At the outset of the novel, in Moll's youth, we see straight away what emphasis she places on independence and self-possession, very unfeminine characteristics for the time. She wants, as a gentlewoman, to be able to Work for myself, and get enough to keep me without that terrible Bug-bear going to Service, whereas they meant to live Great, Rich, and High… (14). Her notion of being a gentlewoman centers entirely around what she can accomplish through her own actions. She values being able to Work for [her]self above all else; this is the foundation of her aspirations. The definition of gentry that she misses has to do with living Great and High, like how others in the society conceive of gentry. These, in contrast with the very physical nature of earning money and subsisting, are ideals and subjectivities. It is in the perception of others that one is great and high; the second part of belonging to the higher class has to do with social connections and establishment of a name in the higher society. Rather than wanting to belong to a class or to an insular group, Moll wants simply to be the master of herself. In the case of the first family of a gentlewoman who takes her in after the death of her Nurse, she is allowed to live a similar life to the daughters of the house: and as I was always with them, I learn'd as fast as they...yet I learn'd by Imitation and enquiry, all that they learn'd by Instruction and Direction…I learn'd to Dance and speak French as well as any of them… (18). She outlines here the distinction she draws between formal learning, Instruction and Direction, which belongs to the realm of the gentry, and her own sort of learning, by Imitation and enquiry. Thus, she is not completely dependent on anyone for her learning; the mention of enquiry suggests an active curiosity that enables her to learn. Her learning alongside of the daughters of the family is acceptable, but we see later that it becomes problematic.

Moll seems, at every turn, to threaten both the gentry and the notion of family. In the case of the family, it is when Moll is a threat to intrude on their family, to threaten the cohesion. The mother addresses Moll after she refutes wanting to marry the son without prior parental consent: for we have all look'd upon you as a kind of Snare to my Son...for we have all a Respect for you still, tho' not so much, as to have it be the Ruin of my Son; but if it be as you say, we have all wrong'd you very much(43). Moll is addressed as a potential Snare and Ruin. But addressing Moll's intentions of not wanting to marry the son, the mother changes her tone, saying that is the family who has wrong'd her. The snare here is in reference to Moll's potential unadvised marriage to their son. The implication is that her lower birth would tarnish his name. Moll is upsetting the family dynamic because, suddenly, she is in a position to make herself a permanent addition to their family. Moll's semblance of belonging to the gentry is so great that they hold a certain respect for her, that eventually she does marry this son, without great consequence.

In much the same way, children are presented as inconveniences and disruptions to life and independence. After the death of her first husband, she says: My two children were indeed taken happily off my Hands, by my Husband's Father and Mother, and that by the way was all they got by Mrs. Betty (49). Here, the children as talked about as if they are objects: children could easily be replaced by any other tangible noun—shoes, or pillowcases. They are being acted upon, taken; they have no agency and no human characteristics, serving in this sentence as simply things Moll chooses to leave behind. The familial tie that Moll has to them is completely severed at this leaving, because she conceives of them as objects. Later, she says in reference to her Lancashire husband, …tho' I was in no condition to have had him yet, not being so foolish to marry him when I knew my self to be with Child by another Man (127). She also has no sense of maternal tie to this child; the child, instead, is a tangible and visible manifestation of the affair she had with another man. It is because she bears this child that she meets the Midwife and her future governess, who says ...and if you have no Friends to come to you, you may save the Expence of a supper (131). This is where the reader is reminded explicitly of Moll's lack of connection to those around her. It is in her isolation that this child is a burden; this time, there is no family to hand it off to, and no acquaintances to give support during this time.

Moll's occupation as a thief necessitates her isolation from society, yet at the same time, her bond with her Mistress seems to be one of the most genuine in the book; her Mistress is the only confidante she has, and the only one to whom she tells the story of her affair. In some of the phrasing used, like I came home to my Governess, we see the contrast between Moll's state here and in the rest of the book; she has, for once, a home to which she returns, not an impermanent lodging or an apartment at which she awaits her lover, but a place of refuge (158). She says, when she leaves to hide out for fear of being apprehended, I had no Recourse, no Friend, no Confident but my old Governess, and I knew no Remedy but to put my Life in her Hands (173). Surprisingly, she speaks of her life, for one of the only times, as under the control of someone else, but the situation is such that she must remain anonymous so as not to be arrested. Her faith in her Governess here is out of desperation, and soon enough, she is back to her occupation and independence. She is even isolated from her fellow thieves: Here again my old Caution stood me in good stead; Namely, that tho' I often robb'd with these People, yet I never let them know who I was, or where I Lodg'd; nor could they ever find out my Lodging…They all knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders (175). Anonymity is the vehicle through which Moll is a success at robbery, and her preservation of her identity keeps her in the business much longer than the rest; she is not a member of the gentry that she robs from, because they must not recognize her, but she also is not a member of the society of thieves. Though the interdependence between Moll and her governess most closely resembles anything close to a family unit, the dissolution of the unit sheds light on the very nature of the relationship: when Moll is charged with the sentence of death, the governess is struck with Horror at the Sense of her own wicked Life (225). Though they do depend on each other, they also share solidarity without safety; they endanger their lives and oppose the law; their sort of familial structure has no allowable place in society.

Moll is a stranger to both us and to those around her; the connections she forms with people all eventually dissolve. She always moves on independently, and ultimately, her entire life is gained by her own hand and her own initiative. Even at the end, it is her will and her plan for buying a plantation that brings them back to Virginia, where the traditional family unit is re-established, with the reintroduction of her son. Even so, the end of the novel does not define the rest, and Defoe comments on the necessary isolation and anonymity of a woman in pursuit of her own agency. It is through denying the maternal instinct and not defining herself as belonging to any single society or community that Moll achieves the financial independence that allows her to be the sort of gentlewoman she defines for herself at a young age. In Moll's masculinity and externalization, Defoe creates a story that is at once about an individual struggle and a struggle that sheds light on the growing individualism and subsequent isolation of humanity in a changing society.",0,0,0,0,9884
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,On Frames and Resistance in Pride and Prejudice,"In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the larger philosophical questions of beauty, truth, and rationality are examined in the context of frames. There exist the frames of the country and of the city, of privilege and of poverty, of men and of women, of family, and, potentially of most thematic importance to the novel, of acting within and without the limits of decorum and the judgment of others. There are limits to everything in this society, limits on who can court whom, limits on the manner in which one either defers or condescends. Lady Catherine acknowledges this existence of spheres based on inherent social limits, addressing Elizabeth: The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune…If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up(232). Lady Catherine very astutely focuses on the crux of the conflict that Elizabeth, Jane, and all who are not privileged face in the presence of richness and supposed good breeding. There is a certain association between acting inconsistently with one's class and upbringing, and pretense. Lady Catherine lists the very concerns which could potentially isolate the Bennets from the Darcys and Bingleys, of breeding and fortune, and very directly suggests that Elizabeth does not belong; her use of the term quit the sphere suggests that Elizabeth must cross a line, a demarcation which will involve her into an entirely different existence. It is this focus on decorum and acting within one's spheres of existence, in all their myriad forms, which certain of Austen's characters, like Lady Bingley, espouse. But Jane Austen herself seems to suggest a rethinking of rough demarcations, of pushing one's boundaries and frames in as many ways as possible. An inspection of those things and characters she chooses to paint reveals the ideals she is pushing thematically in the novel, of being constrained by one's context and resisting it.

Austen is inspired by the ideals of the picturesque, as suggested by a moment of metafiction which happens in the beginning of the novel. As Mrs. Hurst takes Darcy's hand and they walk off together with Miss Bingley, Elizabeth says You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye(36). In this moment, we see the literal illustration of Austen's thematic exploration. The footnote explains this moment as a rule of the picturesque, that groups of three are especially attractive because of their irregularity (36). A basic rule of picturesque, a focus on that which is irregular, a perception of that which is not typically smooth or perfectly beautiful (Gilpin). In the scene in the novel, Austen draws attention to her own acknowledgement of her craft; in addressing the fact the three are picturesque, she also expedites Elizabeth's immediate removal from the scene; yet, when Elizabeth is removed, so the scene ends. In terms of Elizabeth's notion of picturesque, that they are charmingly group'd, there is a simplicity to her meaning, implying a certain beauty or aesthetic appeal. We learn later, at Pemberley, that Elizabeth is very unacquainted with art. Austen, however, well-acquainted with notions of the picturesque, reveals subtly her design as an author; scenes end when Elizabeth is not in them; her choice of focus, like in a picturesque painting, is on the ruggedness, an irregularity of character, which manifests more in Elizabeth than in any other.

We begin the novel within the frame of the Bennet household, a household rife with the aspirations and endeavors of a number of women, though encircling and limited by the agency of a single man. The first dialogue comes from Mrs. Bennet, who is entreating Mr. Bennet to call on Mr. Bingley. Upon assuming Mr. Bennet will not do so, she says such things as I am sick of Mr. Bingley, and then hearing his admission of having called upon him, says I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance (6). The implied sentiment here is that the happiness of the girls is dependent on a familiarity with eligible bachelors in town, and that the task of creating such an acquaintance is entirely within Mr. Bingley's hands. Here, then, is the demarcation: Mrs. Bennet, insisting so vehemently on Mr. Bennet's taking an action, is not able to act directly on her own, because she is not the patriarch of the family. To neglect such an acquaintance would mean a certain disregard for the prospects of his daughters, and when Mrs. Bennet assumes Mr. Bennet has not called, she is resigned to Mr. Bennet's choices.

There is a certain aspect to the limitations of the Bennet household that is aptly described in Nina Auerbach's essay: The near-invisibility of Longbourn and the collective life of the Bennets within it is at one with its economic invisibility under an entail which denies a family of women legal existence” (330). This invisibility is not only thematically true, but physically and descriptively true. There is a glaring lack of description of the Bennet house itself; it serves as a baseline, a starting point from which all other things lead. Especially compared to other locations, the Bennet house remains elusive physically; because its ownership is so tenuous, because none of the women have any certain claim to it, the invisibility is, as Auerbach suggests, indicative of a disempowerment of the Bennet women. When we see the examples of higher-class, higher-power places, notably Pemberley, the descriptions are vivid and solid, just as is Darcy's solid and incontrovertible presence associated with the manor: …their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings( 159). The descriptions of the manor are constantly juxtaposed with references to the master; it exists because of his fortune and his taste. There is a consistent presence of Darcy, just in the description of his house; he has a certain dominion, both in the thoughts of Elizabeth, and over the manor. The descriptions are such of isolation, because Elizabeth has denied him, and is grappling at his presence through his material belongings. Austen's choice of painting Pemberley, but not Longbourn, is a conscious one, reflecting their frames of existence: where Darcy's Pemberley itself casts a dominion over the surroundings, Longbourn is invisible materially and economically, the Bennets quite unsure of its remaining theirs.

The sphere of family relations and connections, as Lady Catherine puts it, are most apparent in Darcy's case. His connections to Mr. Bingley bring connections to Miss Bingley, who hopes to seduce him; his tie to his sister creates a family dynamic that functions outside the typical two-parent and children assumption; his ties to Wickham stem from his father's legacy; his ties to Lady Catherine open him to a potential prospect for her daughter; and his ties to Elizabeth Bennet must invariably lead to his ties to her family. If we imagine Darcy with this web of connections, it is apparent that he must tread very carefully to avoid severing any ties. But in both Elizabeth and Darcy's cases, there are certain conventions that must be overturned in order for their love to exist.

Darcy overcomes his breeding, and the strict conventions of his class by condescending to Elizabeth, and helping her family. As we see in his first scene, Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party (8). Darcy's enclosure within a certain circle of acquaintances and of class is readily apparent in his refusing to dance or speak with anyone outside his immediate acquaintances; in doing so, he denies the social possibilities inherent in a party, choosing instead to stay rigidly confined within the frame he is accustomed to. However, during the accidental meeting at Pemberley, when he is introduced to Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, he expresses a much different perspective on mingling with those outside his class: That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner (165). The conversation, the beginning of a dialogue is exactly that which drives the novel; in conversing with Mr. Gardiner, Darcy is expressing an acceptance of Elizabeth's family as equals. A conversation implies that the two sides are equally engaged, and it is this equality of speaking which signals many turning points in the novel. This passage signals Darcy's breaking free of the rigid assumptions which bound him. Elizabeth's communication with Darcy when he first suggests marriage is what reveals to him all her notions of him that he had not before known. The extent of the conversation is what drives the plot; the subsequent letter from Darcy another extensive attempt at communication. Conversation breaks the barriers which have thus far disenabled them from behaving freely towards each other. And conversation seems to stem freely from them once they receive the approbation of the family.

In the end, we return to the idea of frames, this time illustrated by houses and their locations. Austen details where each couple lives and their relations to each other, and in doing so, establishes that these new frames are malleable and transcend the notions of class and fortune which guided the beginning of the novel. In terms of Lady Catherine, her resentment gave way…and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley… (254). So does Lady Catherine become integrated into a new order of social spheres which does not operate on exclusion.

Austen, in her attention to certain aesthetic and visual descriptions, reveals her tendency for complication, for malleable and changing characters which push their boundaries and frames. Though Darcy and Elizabeth both begin in spheres which are uncompromisable and very limiting in their individual ways, Elizabeth manages to break away from the invisibility of Longbourn and Darcy manages to rework Pemberley as a place of socialization and integration, rather than the isolation which was present in its initial description. The combination of physical descriptions and character-driven events defeat the notions of class distinction and immobility which mire the beginning of the novel.",0,0,0,0,10668
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Satire and Morality in The Vicar of Wakefield,"The Vicar of Wakefield, by Oliver Goldsmith, can be read as a satire because of the exaggerated portrayal of innocence and gullibility, particularly in the case of Dr. Primrose. The decisions the family makes and the situations they experience are ridiculous, not only for the reader, but for other characters in the story as well. However, The Vicar of Wakefield has a very different end than the typical literary satire. Rather than denouncing vice and folly through sinful characters, Goldsmith draws attention to the foolish acts of morally upright characters, suggesting that well-intentioned, religiously-guided behavior does not always result in a positive end. It is the more multi-faceted characters, those who are deceptive and shift roles both in the eyes of the reader and the family, who are in control of themselves and the destiny of the family. The eventual balance of reward for righteous behavior is not achieved by the Primroses themselves, but by other characters, specifically William Thornhill, who transcends notions of class and propriety, appearing in the story both as a villain and hero. When confronted with the deception and evil inherent in the world, the Primroses, guided and represented by the narrator, must be rescued time and time again. The story challenges the narrator's limited perception of the world, placing more importance on the mutability of character, chance and trickery to effect consequences in life, rather than to Primrose's much simpler, more ineffective notion of virtue that goes rewarded.

Dr. Primrose is a character both incredibly sentimental, showing emotion which oftentimes prevents him from acting in dire situations, and guided by very rigid principles. This dichotomy of reason and emotion creates tension between his actions and thoughts. He sets down laws, but cannot maintain his authority as master of the family. He elaborates for pages on end about the need for reform in laws and power, but we never see evidence in his character that suggests he can accomplish these reforms. He is a man of thoughts ideals that do not reflect in his actions. For example, he describes their first churchgoing day in the new town: When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery, which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well so ever I fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters; yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery… (23). My sumptuary edicts suggests that he has created laws to which he expects his family to adhere. His preoccupation with dress as a marker of class and worth is indicted here and throughout the novel. He creates legislation, but as demonstrated in this quote, his daughters remain secretly attached to all their former finery; they internalize their own wishes and vanity, but not admonitions, which more times than not fall useless. In another example, their landlord visits and asks for a song. Primrose narrates: As I did not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances, I winked out my daughters in order to prevent their compliance, but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother; so that with a cheerful air they gave us a favorite song… (25). Here, Primrose's action is counteracted by one from the mother, and the daughters end up ignoring his wishes and heeding their mother's. The use of the word counteract suggests that his effort is completely neutralized by the mother's, so that the woman's will supercedes the man's. This holds true to the sentimental form, and demonstrates how completely Primrose's edicts fail in practice.

Also speaking to the simplicity and ineffectiveness of the narrator is his obstinate adherence to class rules. He does not waver from his beliefs, which do not allow him to notice deeper than the superficial qualities of those around him. The examples of his efforts at creating laws for his family also relate to issues of class. He mentions disproportioned acquaintances, meaning that Thornhill was too wealthy to be prudently associated with his much poorer family (25). Later, he describes how his daughters touch Mr. Thornhill: All my endeavours could scarce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his cloaths, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes, to see what was there (26). The image is striking because of the way he describes his own family: dirty fingers which tarnish the clothes suggests a soiling, his family somehow denigrating Mr. Thornhill simply by touching him. His tone is detached, as if he is describing beggars on the street, people fouled, though we know from earlier descriptions that these women were earlier dressing above their class, polished and clean. As with the early sumptuary concerns, Primrose is painfully aware of his own class and the propriety of it; he is so much preoccupied with this that he remains a spectator: his family's touching and handling, their investigation of Thornhill's pockets is a symbolic curiosity, a search for secrets that are hidden, whereas Primrose can only see the surface, nothing past the class of the person and his own sense of imprudence.

William Thornhill, in the guise of Burchell, says of himself He was surrounded by crowds, who shewed him only one side of their character; so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing there were rascals (19). It is inferred that he changes greatly after this, because he must regain his fortune after having been too trusting. The way in which he describes his former self is very similar to Primrose's own predicament, especially in the case in which both he and Moses are hoodwinked by the same man, who takes both their horses. Being shown only side of their character alludes to the difference between William Thornhill and the narrator: Thornhill, once similar to Primrose, has since learned to embrace the multiple sides of his own personality, to seek out the reality of people and not judge by appearances alone. Primrose still cannot do this, as indicated by his interactions with different classes, of his judgment of his own family, and his misfortunes with money due to his snap judgments of others.

It is William who generally fixes all that has gone awry in the Primroses' life. He is the one who has the power to pass judgment in the end. He says, upon revealing his true identity to the family I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most sincere esteem (152). It is William who must bring justice; Primrose's own actions do not promise a good end. His unveiling heralds a turn of events. Curiously, the eventual restoration of the family comes from a series of almost arbitrary events. Jenkinson happens to recognize the description of Sophia's kidnapper, also later admitting he had married Olivia and Thornhill, saying Perhaps you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this. But no. To my shame I confess it, my only design was to keep the licence and let the ‘Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come whenever I wanted money (164). This is followed by immediate pleasure, but the juxtaposition with the very selfish, unvirtuous story means that they have accepted the good news, despite the means to an end.

The ending rests not completely resolved, because though William Thornhill is established as a redeeming figure, bringing Sophia back and resolving the marriages of each of the family members, people like his nephew Thornhill have not redeemed their actions earlier in the story. The nephew says I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress (155). This theme continues from the beginning of the story, in which Primrose establishes his efforts at legal power over his own household. The difference here, however, is that the nephew Thornhill has the means to pursue prosecution and real consequences of legal precedents. To this end, the practice wins out over Primrose's idea of legality, which remains mostly theoretical, never practical. A sort of trial ensues, witnesses like the butler brought into testify. The narrator, upon hearing that the nephew Thornhill is already married, says For when we reflect upon the various schemes this gentleman has laid to seduce innocence, perhaps someone more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him (163). Thornhill's final punishment, having not been able to trick Wilmot from her fortune, rests entirely on another man's greater trickery. This neither aligns with Primrose's idea of virtuous action securing heaven, nor does it undo Thornhill's initial sabotage, abduction and trickery. The outcome, in which Olivia is thus restored to reputation, to friends and fortune at once, was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay and restore former health and vivacity (164). Reputation here is not a reputation based on moral goodness, but on fortune, the cause of all the class distinction that Primrose so adamantly lectures against, instead seeking modesty and class propriety for his daughters. This restoration to fortune, hinging on a marriage with a trickster and an exploitative cheat, is not altogether ideal. Thornhill is found criminal through the trial, yet because Jenkinson out-tricks him by having already married him, the family is happy. There is no complete sense of redemption or resolution here, because it is not virtue that is rewarded, but deceit.

The consequences and final judgments in The Vicar of Wakefield are rendered by those characters who express the greatest mutability, who have been deceptive, have worn guises and used trickery to achieve their ends. The most morally grounded character, with the most faith in doctrine and idealism, is Primrose, yet the family is punished time and time again for the foolish behavior which stems from his simple way of looking at the world. The end of the story, though seemingly establishing a virtuous family rewarded, places great emphasis on fortune and on deceit to achieve an end. Primrose, guided by morality and principles of class propriety, is the least ineffectual when trying to effect change; as the leader of his family, he remains generally ineffective until William Thornhill saves them. Goldsmith overturns the conventions of satire, exposing vice and folly, but moreso exposing and questioning innocence and the kind of morality that has no place in the world.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Space of Dreams in The Age of Innocence,"In Edith Warton's The Age of Innocence, dreams of self-fulfillment lie in contrast to the context in which the characters exist—the time, the place, the society. This context is eminently important to the denouement of the plot and is deterministic of the fate of these characters. Throughout the novel, the narrator is a voice from the future, so that the portrayal Old New York does not just exist insularly, but in reference to a potential, to impending and sometimes unthinkable change. For this reason, the last chapter is crucial to our understanding of unrequited dreams. In her portrayal of fate, Wharton suggests that the dreams of Newland and Ellen can only continue to be dreams within the context and time of their New York social circle, but for the next generation, the romance of Newland and Ellen would have had no restraints in a new world order. The world of the last chapter, particularly Paris is, in a way, the potential space of the dream of Newland and Ellen's love, but there is a sense that passing time and a life already lived makes this era the domain of the new generation.

Newland and Ellen's romance is shaped by their dreams, by the fantasy of their future together. When asked if he wants Ellen for a mistress, Newland responds I want—I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like that—categories like that—won't exist. Where we will be simply two human beings who love each other…and nothing else on Earth will matter (238). He wants a space devoid of context, not only without expectations and conventions to follow, but entirely without categories to qualify love. The idea that nothing else on Earth will matter is an ideal, a space in which the two of them can be the sole inhabitants, an idea of Eden or a personal utopia. They find this space separate from anything else on Earth for mere moments during the story: in her house the first time he visits, in the house of the old Patroon, on the boat in Boston, in the carriage coming back to New York. But the moments are fleeting, and, when they end, they still have no action or plan to assure a life together. It is a rare occurrence that they find each other in these solitary moments, and the possibility of such a rapport outside of these spaces does not exist. Similarly, the promises made during these interactions do not endure; on the boat, Ellen promises that I won't go back, a promise we want to believe (201). But, it becomes shattered when taken outside of the realm of their space apart; such a promise cannot exist when there are such duties to others, when there is a society in which they must fit themselves.

When Archer goes in his wife's chariot to bring Ellen back to New York, he envisions a dream of her: he pictured Madame Olenska's descent from the train, his discovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless faces…her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage…in the motionless carriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to the other side of the sun. It was incredible, the number of things he had to say to her… (234). The dream is detailed, with a series of seemingly ordinary images, but then the language tips into the realm of fantasy, in which even the movement of the earth bypasses them, seem[s] to glide away, and the carriage remains motionless. His dream is, essentially, a wish for a halt in time, in which a carriage is simply a space in which they can converse, not a vehicle in which society must always be heading somewhere. In his dream, the earth and sun are no longer relevant in their time-keeping. But even as he says after he sees her in reality that it all happened as he had dreamed, the dream must always end (235). In this case, it ends when Archer asks Ellen Then what, exactly, is your plan for us? and she replies For us? But there is no us in that sense! We're near each other if we stay far away from each other. Then we can be ourselves (239). This suggests that these moments of intimacy in which they are honest in their love cannot persist if they are two people in the world together; the microcosm of an ideal that they create in these small spaces, like in the carriage, exist within themselves. This microcosm cannot be externalized. The carriage stops to let him off, but continues moving; Archer does not stand but begins walking home. Real life and the inevitable progress of time continues; his walk home is a return to a familiar context.

In the final chapter, the flower of life that Archer misses is, in one way, this same dream, one which could not grow in the stifling environment of his youth, before he has a child (286). Fanny Beaufort is portrayed as a likeness of Countess Olenska, but at once not Countess Olenska, because she has not felt the sting of being ostracized or having to re-imagine herself for the sake of others. New York society instead of being distrustful and afraid of her, took her joyfully for granted...Nobody was narrow-minded enough to rake up against the half-forgotten facts of her father's past and her own origin (290). The conventions that once dictated and bound Archer to a life of duty—the importance of keeping up a façade in having a clean record and a good family, the absolute crash of the social structure around Archer when Beaufort was found to have defaulted on his finances, the ostracism of him and his apologetic wife—are forgotten by this new society. Fanny Beaufort is the descendant of these same Beauforts, yet it would be hard to tell simply by her interaction with the world. She seems completely separated from the Beauforts of the rest of the novel; if she is Countess Olenska, she is a perpetually happy one, accepted joyfully, taken for her accomplishments. Wharton stresses the parallel of Fanny and Dallas' love and that of Newland and Ellen's, but there is such little conflict between the personal and the social in Fanny and Dallas' engagement that this resembles the dream-world Newland once longed for, the one in which they are simply two human beings who love each other. Wharton urges the reader to consider this prospect by saying There was nothing now to keep [Ellen] and Archer apart—and that afternoon he was to see her (294). Nothing keeps them apart in terms of spousal obligation, but, yet, something does end up keeping them apart.

Archer's conception of Ellen in this last chapter is like a dream: When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was abstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed (286). Ellen was an ideal and an escape in his youth; she is, in his old age, a symbol of all his regret for not having been able to pursue his own passions. Whereas she was a real, tangible lover in his youth as well as a dream, she exists now, after so long, only as a dream. In the closing scene of Archer on the doorstep, he says to his son Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough (297). It is long past the time when he can pursue dreams; he is old-fashioned, the entirety of his life defined by a time long past. On the doorstep, his notion of her is, again, a dream: Then he tried to see the persons already in the room—for probably at that sociable hour there would be more than one—and among them a dark lady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly… (298). He has internalized her, and even the very vivid daydream is not the neutral space he once wished for; they cannot be alone in the dream, for there would be more than one. There is no person left who will keep them apart, but his fantasy has been so long internalized, his entire life lived without the flower of life. His inaction is at once a retreat into dreams, and a realization that he cannot externalize the dream; the only course for a man who has seen his life pass by him without passion is, as it was when he got out of the carriage, to walk home, to proceed with the tide of time.

We understand the impossibility of Ellen and Archer's love from the fleeting moments in which they are alone; each time they must return, the promises and hopes they have of one another no longer apply in the greater society and time. And so, their dreams are internalized and never expressed in the context of the greater society. The end of the novel describes a more progressive, more open time, rife not only with the potential of politics and technology, but with the potential of the individual; Dallas and Fanny's unsurprising engagement is what Ellen and Archer's might have been, had they both been born into this era. But Dallas and Fanny are not Ellen and Archer; they were not brought up in the 19th century. What marks Archer as an outsider to this modern society is his inability, ultimately, to pursue the individual, self-fulfilling life, in which Ellen is a central figure. Archer is irrevocably bound to what has come before; he has lived the majority of his life denying his dreams, and, ultimately, the dreams are more real to him than his pursuit of them. The potential space of their consummated romance is defined by their experience, their ties back to a context in which they could not live happily; although the society has changed, Archer's life is bound by the commitment he once made and cannot unmake.",0,0,0,0,9298
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Freedom of One Word,"Existentialist philosophy asserts that we live in a broken world (Marcel). An ambiguous world (de Beauvoir). A dislocated world (Merleau-Ponty). A world of indifference. Of absurdity (Camus). One we are thrown into and abandoned in, yet condemned and free (Heidegger and Sartre). It is this philosophy that detonates what superficially appears to be the doctrine of a dark and dismal lifestyle, yet it is quite the opposite. It is a philosophy of freedom, of choice, of letting go of that which is unimportant and accepting a world characterized by irrationality and indifference. Grounded in the freedom of self-invention and power of choice, one is not bound to the simplifications and theoretical definitions of others have determined what being human predicates, but the assertion that individual man defines his own reality and existence.

Often times in literature, an existentialist figure will find himself separated from the world and other people. As a result of feeling isolated or alone, he feels threatened, meaningless, insignificant, but learns to embrace the unresolvable confusion of the human world and resist the all-too-human desire to resolve that confusion by extending himself to whatever appears or can be made to appear safe or familiar. Published in 1952 by Ralph Ellison, the disoriented protagonist of Invisible Man fits this description by facing a confusing world in which he cannot fit into. Wherever Ellison's unnamed Negro character travels in the novel, he is weakened and left rootless by people who did either entirely disregard his inner character or envisage and use him as a symbol. In the 581-page novel, the narrator spends much of it shifting his personality like the colors on that of a chameleon, as each time he throws off that mask, he finds himself trapped inside another stereotype or disguise. In Ellison's existential bildungsroman, it is only until he realizes the absurdity and irrationality of the world that he is able to free himself of the building expectations of the roles he feels he is supposed to play. A close reading of the opening passage and concluding passages demonstrates the existential ontogenesis of Ellison's protagonist as it exhibits his movement from rural innocence to cosmopolitan maturity and disillusionment. With the discovery of one word, he finds himself free, free of the expectations and roles and he creates his own reality, and finally able to establish his identity as the man he wants to be.

Following a wild and disorienting prologue, the narrator begins in the first paragraph with self reflection. He comments, All my life I had been looking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tried to tell me what it was…I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer (15). Acting as frame for the novel, this narrative gives readers the context for the story of an existential bildungsroman.

Occurring later in the first chapter, the narrator attends a gathering to give his celebrated graduation speech to the significant white men of the community. Expecting a proper, polite, and respectable gathering, the narrator finds the scene of to be the exact opposite. He finds himself hurled into a group of other Negro boys, forced watch a beautiful, stark naked woman dance, and then fight in a humiliating battle royal. Serving no purpose other than vulgar entertainment for the prominent white men of the town, the battle royal exists as another occasion in the novel where white men take advantage of the narrator's passivity and idealistic nature.

In addition to heightening the tension between submission and rebellion, the battle royal can be seen as a contrast of the narrator's personality, between his youth and later developed self. Later in the novel at the occurrence of his existential revelation, he has a specific understanding and diction to describe the procession of chaotic ongoing events surrounding him. But, during the battle royal, he endures the same injustice, the same randomness, the same irrationality and problems of agency, yet he equivocally describes it. He claims he had some misgivings over the battle royal (17), feels guilt and fear (19) and blind terror (21). Despite the loss of his dignity (I had no dignity (22) in the mad (20) anarchy (21) of the situation, the narrator continues to fight automatically (24). He obediently follows and does not question his orders. There was nothing to do but what we were told, he claims (21). A fundamental cornerstone in existentialism is the belief in a choice – there is always a choice. With the narrator indicating he had none, Ellison highlights his immaturity and inability to command his own life as lives in the shadows of others.

In stark contrast of his thoughts and self at the end of the novel, Ellison willfully places this scene as the opening chapter. The absolute absurdity and irrationality of this commencing incident is no mistake. Ellison purposely introduces his narrator in a light of inferiority and literal and metaphorical blindness to show the development of his protagonist into a confident existentialist figure. Ellison extends his naïveté through the symbol of the blindfold. The blindfold parallels the narrator's metaphorical blindness in that he cannot see through the mendacious masks of the white men's benevolence. Like the blindfold, the speech he gives also plays with another theme of the book. His memorized oratory parallels the narrator playing the game as he participates in a sort of performance, a masquerade of acting and playing the part of a humble Negro boy. Contributing to the narrator's metaphorical blindness and performance, the sequence of the battle royal contributes to the narrator's initial steps in becoming the man he chooses to become.

Fast forwarding to chapter 23, the narrator realizes his role in the Brotherhood. Furious to finally understand his function was nothing more than to act as a puppet for a corrupt organization, the narrator begins a deep process of self reflection. He comments,

And now all past humiliations became precious parts of my experience, and for the first time…I began to accept my past…I saw that [images of past humiliations] were more than separate experiences. They were me; they defined me. I was my experiences and my experiences were me(507-8).

This passage marks the narrator's commencing conscious process of self-invention as he begins to flirt with existential philosophy in his building of his identity. It is further developed in chapter 25 while under attack by Ras's mob. This is the most crucial moment of the narrator's existential bildungsroman and it begins with Ras threatening his life. 'Hang the lying traitor,' Ras shouted (558). It is at this moment in which the narrator, faced with the very likely prospect of death, begins to see through the eyes of an existentialist. …It seemed unreal. I faced them knowing that a madman in a foreign costume was real and yet unreal, knowing that he wanted my life, that he held me responsible for all the nights and days and all the suffering and for all that which I was incapable of controlling (558). The playing with the words real and unreal plays with the idea of absurdity, of death and existence being absurd, and the world existing as a meaningless scope of irrationality in which he begins to realize his place. In the next paragraph, he repeats the word absurd four times, each time recapitulating the power and force behind that word. He now has a word, a language, to describe the night, Ras's existence, his existence, and the deceptive American masquerading for identity. Unlike his description of the battle royal in which he not once used the word absurd to describe the utterly insane chaos around him – the word absurd means something to now him: it offers him a new direction new and possibilities in life. The repetition of the word absurd furthermore alludes to a fundamental key in existentialism. Ellison crafts his interpretation of the absurd to refer to the objectivity, indifference, and ambiguity the narrator experiences in the world, and simultaneously the possibility of the narrator creating meaning through his actions and interpretations.

His new discovery of the absurd contributes to the narrator's realization for the first time that he has control over his life and the power of choice. [I] recognized the absurdity of the whole night…and I knew that it was better to live out one's own absurdity than to die for that of others, whether for Ras's or Jack's. His existential breakthrough creates the narrator's source of meaning to his life as the narrator's identity. He later comments in the epilogue that my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own (573), and following and attempting to fulfill the expectations of others, he found it destructive to his identity and his creation of meaning of his life. The consequent action of throwing the spear back at Ras demonstrates the narrator's commitment to his own identity and his permanent refusal to be subject to others peoples' visions and demands any longer. With this notion, he finally devotes himself totally to an effort to assert his true identity.

The next chapter finds the narrator's story has come full circle, as it both begins and ends with his underground life. Though some critics see his choice to live underground as a cop-out or evasion from his problems, in reading his choice through the philosophy of existentialism, readers find that the importance lies in neither asking if he is evading or snubbing society, but that he has made a choice. Instead of trying to follow the myriad of advice and guidance recommended to him throughout the text, the narrator takes matters into own hands and decides to stay underground to ponder his existence and the meaning he wants his life to have. In his cave, he points out, he does not have the interference of others, and he is open to thinking for himself. At the end of the novel, the narrator affirms his uncertainty in regards to a concrete identity, but determines to venerate his own complexity and duty to society as an individual. In reflecting back to his language and personality in the initial chapter of battle royal then comparing that to the closing episode with Ras, readers witness his movement from rural innocence to maturity and disillusionment in this existential bildungsroman, in which a lone protagonist discovers himself and frees himself of the expectations and roles created by society. Life is to be lived, not controlled, he claims, and humanity is won by continuing to play in the face of defeat (577).",0,0,0,0,10694
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Autonomy: Fact or Fiction,"In Western society (specifically in the United States) there has existed an idea since the colonial days that any individual, despite their class in the motherland, can achieve wealth and prosperity through hard work and determination alone. This idea has been commonly referred to throughout history as the myth of autonomy, because so many have tried it and failed. While not originally created as a myth, it was an idea that could give those trying to escape either religious persecution, monarchy rule, or an unfortunate lot in class structure a chance to become independently wealthy and part of an upper class where no upper class as of yet existed (the British colonies). However, this idea became a myth when it was realized that as long as there was a ruling body governing from a distance (England) and making all the rules to live by-from common law to business taxation-there was no chance to become independently wealthy unless birth had already dictated it. Thus, the myth of autonomy was born. Surprisingly, after the Revolution, the myth of autonomy was revived and in fact became somewhat possible for even those of the lowest class.

In Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, this myth of autonomy is alive and well. Crusoe is able to break away from his station in England and achieve independent prosperity on his island for twenty-eight years (as well as his later wealth due to his plantations in Brazil). Interestingly, he is only able to achieve this autonomy once the rule of the monarchy is completely lost from his life. There arises, however, a conflict between this autonomy and Crusoe's faith that God has intervened many times to save his life since he first washed up on the island. By examining this conflict in terms of certain aspects of autonomy and faith (such as pride versus humility and self-reliance versus gratitude), there is a much larger connection between capitalism and asceticism that arises. Looking at both of these, a greater understanding can be attained as to just how the conflict and the connection contributed to the myth of autonomy in the novel and in the people of the day.

Pride and humility are two emotions that have been at odds since the beginning of mankind; as it is said, pride cometh before the fall. It is therefore preached by many (both religious and secular individuals) that humility is required to have lasting success. But, when one achieves something great, it is only natural and acceptable to take pride in it. This is quite common in Robinson Crusoe, as Crusoe takes nothing but pride in achieving a stable life on his island through his own devices alone. He expresses this best as he lists all of the tribulations he went through to build his original shelter:

Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provisions…I made me a large Tent, which, to preserve me from the Rains…And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock…and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so pass'd and repass'd, as I said by a short ladder, (Defoe, 45).

Humility is lost, especially when Crusoe starts declaring himself King and Lord of the island, and the fall of pride never arrives. This greatly adds to the myth of autonomy, as Crusoe achieves great things and prosperity-and knows it-yet there are no negative consequences to this. He becomes a lord, gains great wealth, and is even rescued (albeit a bit late, but it still happens). Everything goes his way with no need for humility. In a time when very few were actually successful in achieving this type of wealth, the tale of Robinson Crusoe would have acted as a catalyst for more individuals to at least try to attain the dream.

Another well-known and often debated conflict between autonomy and faith is that between self-reliance and gratitude. This conflict, on a more religious level, is basically the age old debate over whether or not there is a God and if there is, what power He holds of an individual's life. Crusoe brings this debate to the forefront: he praises God for his salvation on the island, for bringing him the ship that leads to his rescue, for many of the things that happen in his everyday life after he has sufficiently set himself up on the island, such as when he washed back up on shore after sailing around the island to reach his house: When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, (103). Yet, when it came down to it, he relied solely on his own devices to survive and builds his successful new life. God doesn't give him anything, he does it all on his own. So, Crusoe's situation provides support to the idea that perhaps God has no power over the things that occur in the lives of men. Self-reliance is really the only way to achieve anything. When it is broken down as such, the conflict all but states that the myth of autonomy is not only plausible but possible. Autonomy comes first and foremost from being able to achieve wealth without help from anyone or anything. It is attained by one's hard work and by knowing that the only person who can help in achieving success is one's self. To know that it was possible for Robinson Crusoe to get so much by relying only on himself and pushing gratitude off to the side (and calling on it only when he felt it was absolutely necessary, or when he felt he needed to go through the motions of having retained faith on his island) would have spurred the myth of autonomy forward. This Day I went to Work with it accordingly, and got two Shores or Posts pitch'd upright to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-cross over each Post…and setting up more Posts up with Boards, in about a week more I had the Roof secur'd and the Posts standing in Rows, serv'd me for Partitions to part of my House, (55). Here, Crusoe applies carpentry skills he may not have realized he had to secure his house after a cave in. Even though it was a novel, anyone could have recognized that if a fictional character could have achieved so much on an island, imagine what someone could do in a major city in a new land with all the devices of society at their disposal.

Looking at how faith and autonomy have clashed in the novel (with autonomy coming out as the clear winner), a much broader connection has been revealed between the accumulation of wealth and the work ethic of an individual. This is the [once] commonly held idea that capitalism cannot exist without asceticism. While this has changed somewhat throughout history (with capitalism finding its old roots once again in generational wealth among families), for the most part, it remains the connection. Crusoe is able to achieve a capitalistic society purely by ascetic means. It is his hard work alone that gives him this unimaginable wealth in a place where money has no value and the only other people are cannibals. However, this connection itself is what originally created the myth of autonomy, and when the connection is applied to Western society in the strictly basic form that it is presented in the novel, a few problems arise that again show why autonomy became a myth in the first place. Capitalism is easy for Crusoe to achieve because he is the only individual in his society. He is Lord and laborer; he commands all and receives all wealth. This is fine for a one-man show, but in Western society things do not work so basically. Karl Marx even tried to apply what Crusoe accomplished to Western society: Let us now picture to ourselves…a community of free individuals…in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour-power of the community. All the characteristics of Robinson's labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are social, instead of individual, (Marx, 90). Capitalism relies heavily on the interactions one has with other people. The constant trading of goods and the buying and selling of services is what drives capitalism. Without both of these processes in a multiple person society, capitalism cannot exist, and if capitalism cannot exist then asceticism amounts to absolutely nothing. As Ian Watt said, He owns freehold, an estate which is rich, though unimproved…the shipwreck, which is supposed to be a retributive disaster, is in fact a miraculous gift…and one rendered particularly felicitous by the death of all the other passengers, (Watt, 107). Someone can work as hard as is humanly possible, but without the interaction with others, nothing will be gained. This application is what ultimately breaks the idea of autonomy and turns it into a myth. If there has to be trade with others, then self-reliance is gone, and with it often goes the pride of men. Therefore, while there is indeed a strong connection between capitalism and asceticism, the idea of how these two connect has to be adjusted if autonomy of any kind is going to exist in multi-person societies.

So, the myth of autonomy, while very tempting to many since the European powers began their colonization, is no more than that: a myth. Even with hard work and self-reliance, for capitalism to take off, there has to be trade with other people. While Robinson Crusoe may have been able to achieve autonomy, this comes more from his single person society than from autonomy actually being possible. The only time that autonomy was somewhat possible was just after the Revolutionary War, when the United States started its westward expansion. With the discovery of new land, new resources, and new means of transportation, some individuals were able to achieve great wealth through their efforts. But, in the end, the wealth had to come from somewhere else, since resources in their own right have no real value (save gold). So, even when things had not been discovered, those who did come across them still had to get their wealth through commerce with others. All of this shows that while autonomy and faith may be at odds, there is really no strict autonomy, and in order to achieve wealth, faith has to be pushed to the side. In the end, neither idea wins.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Epic Speak,"The epic classic Beowulf is weak with respect to many typical epic conventions such as starting in medias res, invocating the muse, and utilizing epic similes. In spite of this, the narrative is rich with the epic attribute of elevated language (Online Literary Handbook) in its descriptions of characters. This technique greatly augments the heroic qualities of Beowulf the character while illustrating the contemptible infamy of his foe, Grendel. The inflated prose illuminates the strong foil between the two with physical descriptions and accounts that set Beowulf and Grendel apart from others.

The embellished diction in Beowulf serves as a cue to the reader about the nature of the characters. Without it, the reader would certainly still interpret good characters as good and bad characters as evil; but with it, the reader sees to what extent they are this way. This is made especially clear with the characters Beowulf and Grendel. It is important that this is so since Beowulf is more than just a good character; he's a hero; and Grendel is more than just antagonistic; he's a dreadful villain.

Beowulf's character is elevated from the moment the reader sees him – literally. Before he proves his valor and accomplishes great feats, the author describes what a spectacular sight he is to see. The watchman at Heorot, upon first glance at Beowulf, states, Nor have I seen/ a mightier man-at-arms on this earth/ than the one standing here: unless I am mistaken, / he is truly noble (l. 247-50). This passage speaks a lot to the physical presence that Beowulf brings. He and his men have not yet spoken a word about who they are nor what their purpose is and, without reservation, the watchman not only identifies Beowulf as the leader of the group, but is also convinced of his strength and ability as a warrior. Later, when he reports to Hrothgar about the men, he describes Beowulf as formidable indeed (l. 370). Extravagant language like this used to depict Beowulf's appearance shows that his peers revere him. It is likely the intent of the author that readers feel the same way about him. Simply put, he has it, and everyone can see it.

The reader doesn't get much information about the physical appearance of Grendel, but it can be inferred that he appears mostly contrary to that of Beowulf. The poem depicts Grendel as a spectacle of size and strength. He is strong enough to take hold of 30 men at once (l. 122), and his head is large enough that it took four soldiers to carry it once removed (l. 1637-8). Still, these are just indications of his size. The author uses more emphatic language to depict his demeanor from his physicality.

In the first line about Grendel, he is introduced as a powerful demon, a prowler through the dark (l. 86). This line and the following lines of vague physical description suggest that the author wants readers to conjure up the image of a monster in their own minds instead of having to create one for them. Still, the author's inflated language puts evil ferocity in their heads to shape how they imagine him around mostly negative thoughts. It is likely that this demon is large, dark, and frightening, but beyond that the reader must construct his own Grendel. Later, he is called grim as if to solidify his already dismal disposition (l. 122). Each word employed to depict Grendel is strongly negative and connotative of evil. This is done purposefully; it makes him an adversary from the start. He starts out as evil, then initiates the conflict and remains an antagonist until death. Strong and intentional elevated language contributes greatly to this status, even in the vagueness of his physical description. It is clear that one look upon Beowulf brings amazement while one look upon Grendel brings terror.

Another way the author heightens Beowulf's character is by singling him out as a hero. Just before his showdown with Grendel the author forecasts the imminent outcome of Beowulf's clash with the beast saying, Through the strength of one they all prevailed; / they would crush their enemy and come through/ in triumph and gladness (l. 698-700). Of course this is a reference to Beowulf's conquest over Grendel, but this passage is more important for its implications. It likens Beowulf to Christ in that his people gain victory over their foe (Grendel, or the devil in this sense) through him (and him only). Certainly Beowulf isn't portrayed as a deity himself; nonetheless, the parallel to Christ stands as useful since, like him, everyone is dependent on Beowulf for deliverance. Later in the poem, Beowulf is lifted up again. Before seeking his vengeance on Grendel's mother, King Hrothgar tells Beowulf that redemption is in his hands and his hands only (l. 1376-7). He is their sole hope, and the word choice of the piece makes this quite clear.

Beowulf's individuality is highlighted again a few lines later. As Grendel sneaks into the hall to wreak havoc on the men of Heorot, everyone is asleep – except Beowulf. The text states, The hall-guards were slack, asleep at their posts, / all except one…/ One man, however, was in fighting mood, / awake and on edge, spoiling for action (l. 704-5, 708-9). Here, Beowulf is set apart from other men and placed above them. On this occasion, his preparedness to fight is put on display.

As much as the narrator of the tale does to individualize Beowulf, he distances himself from others with his speech before taking on his final foe, the dragon. He tells the men accompanying him that the battle is not theirs to fight, and that it is only up to him to display his might against the dragon. This is one moment where Beowulf declares his own independence. His words reflect his self-confidence and courage.

While Beowulf stands as the hope of mankind, Grendel remains the opposite. The author calls him God-cursed and The bane of the race of men (l. 712). These lines tell the reader exactly who Grendel is with respect to man and God. He is an enemy and it is his evil presence that necessitates the coming of Beowulf in the first place. It is Beowulf's single effort that dooms Grendel but, before this happens, Grendel's onslaught is defined as a me-against-the-world type of venture (l. 144-5). So we see how Beowulf and Grendel play off each other. Beowulf is the people's champion while the monster is the lonely public enemy number one. The diction of the author foils Beowulf as a creator and preserver with Grendel as a destroyer.

Looking at the initial description of Beowulf in the poem, he is portrayed in the following way: There was no one else like him alive. / In his day, he was the mightiest man on earth (l. 196-7). The author could have called him special and he could have called him mighty, but by including exactly how special and mighty, the reader sees Beowulf in a different light. Specifically, the author utilizes the superlative form often in his descriptions of Beowulf. Above, he is referred to as unlike any other and mightiest. Elsewhere he is conveyed as strongest of warriors (l. 1544), [best]/ to raise a shield or to rule a kingdom (l. 859-60), and unequaled in the quest for glory (l. 2645). The superlative form heightens Beowulf's character to otherwise unattainable levels and displays him as heroic in nearly every sense of the word.

On the other hand, there is strong (nearly superlative) language showing Grendel to be just as evil as Beowulf is good. Grendel is called The captain of evil (l. 749). Calling him a captain is very important to the reader's perception of Grendel as an antagonist. A captain is a leader who generally teaches others to do as he does (in this case, evil). By this, it can be inferred that Grendel is not simply a misunderstood figure gone wrong. Rather, he is a lost cause, fully corrupted and leading the charge against anything good. This point is furthered when the text says that Grendel ruled in defiance of right (l. 144). Here, we see that the monster has no excuse for his ways. In order to defy something, a person must know it first. So Grendel knows goodness and has consciously chosen to carry out evil in its place. He is everything humans strive to avoid and everything Beowulf is not. By utilizing specific diction, the author has achieved his aim at polarizing Beowulf and Grendel (l.164-6).

Most important of the near-superlative descriptions of Grendel are those that speak to his lack of moral convictions. He is intriniscally hateful and shameless (l. 137) and is totally numb to human suffering (119-20). It makes sense that his arch-enemy is exactly the opposite, and is called the man most gracious and fair-minded, / kindest to his people of all the rulers in the world (l. 3180-2). The evidence is clear; Grendel is the anti-hero. The extravagant (and almost exaggerated) style of the narrative makes it all the more lucid that Grendel is perfectly foiled with Beowulf. As inverses, they still share one common characteristic – incredible strength. We know from Unferth that no man has ever survived a tangle with Grendel (l. 525-8). Beowulf's military record is likewise. Something has to give. Fortunately, for the forces of good, it is Grendel's shoulder that does.

As is clear, Grendel is set up to be the antithesis of Beowulf. But the elevated diction of the narrative creates more than just a simple protagonist-antagonist relationship between the two. It is said, As long as either lived, / he was hateful to the other (l. 813-4). They despised each other to the point that each of their purposes was to destroy the other. Without the great emphasis on unambiguously good and bad characteristics and words assigned to each character, much would have been lost to the reader from their epic relationship as foils.",0,0,5.08,2.63,9753
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Autumnal Imagery in Persuasion,"Persuasion was Jane Austen's last novel, completed shortly before her death, at a time when, according to Virginia Woolf in The Common Reader, Austen was just beginning to reach a new literary maturity. This last work includes less dialogue and more reflection, and Austen's observations of humanity are less of facts and more of feelings (Woolf 144). Woolf believes that the story's heavier discussion of emotion proves that Jane Austen had loved and that she was no longer afraid to say so (Woolf 144). Having had this experience in her life, and writing with the knowledge that she was coming closer to her death, Austen dwells frequently upon the beauty and the melancholy of nature, upon the autumn where she had been wont to dwell upon the spring (Woolf 144). Anne Elliot manifests this pleasure in autumn in the novel, and mirrors Austen's own state of experience and lost love. To be in the November of life and still be beautiful and happy, as Captain Wentworth wishes for Louisa (Austen 81-2), is what Anne also wishes for. Through autumnal imagery, Persuasion shows that a mature love and a relationship later in life, without the bloom of youth still attached, is just as solid and fulfilling, if not more so, than those in their spring of life.

Even from the beginning of the novel, the narrator comments that Anne is already past the spring season of her life: A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early (7). However, Anne has also not yet reached her November of life (82). When Wentworth uses this term with Louisa, he refers to the time of life at which point he believes it will be evident if character traits, such as persuadability or firmness of character, remain true and steadfast. Although not yet to that point, Anne is certainly nearing the autumn of her life, post-bloom and youth. Austen may have seen herself at the November of her own life: post-romance (or romance cut short) and, because of illness, near to death. However, Anne, and presumably Austen as well, sees autumn as a beautiful and important season. Anne reflects upon the pleasure she will receive from

the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which has drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling. (78) 

Autumn incites meditation and deep feeling that is worthy and enjoyable to remember. This quote is perhaps a self-conscious statement, because Austen herself acts as a poet describing the beauty of the season with feeling here, especially in the line, the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges. It is clear that Austen, and Anne, value autumn, especially as a poetic theme. With such beauty and worth associated with it, autumn, be it in season of the year or season of life, is far from being a completely undesirable state.

Indeed, when it seems that Anne will be leaving the countryside right away to go to Bath with her father and sister, she reflects that she will miss all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country (32). She will miss the beauty of the season, a beauty which comes not because of the bright, happy feelings attending to it, but from its sweetness and sadness. Anne herself, described not exactly as bright and chipper, could be described in the terms of her depiction of autumn, as so sweet and so sad. Her sweet, kind nature is evident in her dealings with (and contrast to) Mary, in the Croft's and Musgroves' admiration of her, and in Lady Russell's favor for her. Her sadness is evident in her loss of bloom and spirit resulting from her broken heart.

However, spring's splendor still boldly interrupts this quiet autumnal beauty. When Anne overhears Wentworth and Louisa talking about their ideas of admiration and love during their group walk, her own meditation is disturbed. Louisa's spring-like youthfulness and conviction overpower Anne's passive, hidden, age-cured love and ideas about it. Louisa's energetic, blooming show of emotion is a jolt to Anne: The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by—unless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory (79). When confronted with spring, autumn often seems pale in comparison. Anne acknowledges here these negative connotations of the fall season, connotations of decline in seasonal comfort and decline in pleasure. Her personal situation of decline—her early loss of bloom and spirits (28)—is apparent in contrast to Louisa's energy. Her own autumnal situation seems not the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges, poetic and sweet, but merely a solitary withered hedge, sadly standing next to a bright, blooming young bud. When Anne then attempts to rise herself out of this moment of melancholy by questioning the group about a different topic, nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her (79). The others ignore her, or at least do not notice her, in favor of paying attention to more blooming, youthful, hopeful girls in the springs of their lives.

But, in the end, despite this discouragement, the mature, poetical autumn prevails over the spring. Louisa's bold assertions of character lead to her injury and to alteration of her outlook and personality. At the same time as these consequences of an over-exuberance of the spring of life, Austen shows that Anne's leaves are not completely withered. Mr. Elliot notices her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced (97). This helps Captain Wentworth recall what he so admired in her eight years beforehand. Anne hopes to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty (115), but is still able to be striking and admirable in her autumn. When she visits Mrs. Smith, the narrator comments on Anne's change, from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven and twenty, with every beauty excepting bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle (144). She has a more seasoned beauty, and her increased maturity is apparent in her increased understanding. She understands the reasons why she was able to be so persuaded when she was younger, and she understands that she would have been happier if she had not allowed herself to be persuaded (29).

Anne's mature meditation to Captain Harville on the constancy of women and men's feelings is a meditation which could only occur at this later point in her life. It is the final cue for Wentworth to express his feelings, which have also remained constant after the early spring of both of their lives. Deferring their romance until after Anne's youthful bloom actually ensured their later contentment: both reveal their feelings and are more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting (225). If they had been married in their early years, they would not have been so devoted and committed. Now with greater understanding and more developed emotion, their union is more solid. The happiness resulting from Anne learning happiness as she grew older (29) is worth the wait.

Other couples more in the spring of their lives in the novel are also happy, but most have also gone though some sort of maturation experiences before their marriages. Louisa has been sobered by her accident, and Henrietta reigned in by her brief flirtation with (and rejection by) Captain Wentworth. And even with these experiences, from the narrator's perspective, no alliance is as fulfilling as Anne and Wentworth's long-awaited union. Indeed, Anne's time of real action and joy comes in the autumn of her life, represented by her meditation on the season throughout the novel. The loss of her own spring did not ruin her chances—she certainly will continue to be beautiful and happy in the remaining autumn and November of her life with Captain Wentworth.",0,0,0,0,8527
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Milton's Relativism,"Adam and Eve are fortunate enough to reside in Earth's paradise, the Garden of Eden. In this original human home, the air is pure, the trees are loaden with fairest fruit (IV, 147), and man and beast get along swimmingly, playing and chasing one another. The humans who reside in this paradise would find it rather perfect, if only it didn't bore them. For although Eden is perfect, living there for all of eternity is a static, confining existence, especially to Adam and Eve, who reject stasis and embrace motion. For instance, despite the fact that her only experience of weather is the temperate atmosphere of Eden, Eve expresses her preference for the fluctuating conditions of the year's seasons: All seasons and their change all please alike (IV, 640). Likewise, the text's angels and Satan himself represent the excitement of movement on a basic physical level. Satan is often flying around the universe, or creeping and roaming, as in his first visit to Eden, Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale his roam (IV, 538). The angels of heaven, who frequently chase Satan are echo his universal movement (as summarized by the footnote to IV, 862): Starting in the east of Paradise, they encircle the garden on either side and meet again in the extreme west, where Uthuriel and Zephon conduct Satan. Images of the excitement and vitality of change and movement saturate this text.

It is Adam who proposes a theory for why humans (and, by extension, demons and angels) desire such kinetic change. Those other than God can never achieve a state of true, complete satisfaction; because their state is naturally deficient (whereas God's is naturally complete), they will always yearn for something outside of themselves. God alone is able to achieve perfection of himself: To attain / the heighth and depth of Thy eternal ways / All human thoughts come short, Supreme of Things. / Thou in Thyself art perfect and in Thee / Is no deficience found (VIII, 412-416). Adam then notes the human instinct to yearn for such perfection: Not so is Man [perfect], / But in degree, the cause of his desire / By conversation with his like to help / Or solace his defects (VIII, 416-419). Everyone in the universe, apart from God, is unable to enjoy stasis, because no one apart from God is perfect (and satisfied) in a motionless state. That is not to say that these creatures are able to attain perfection in their motion; indeed, they will be imperfect regardless of their actions. But, as Adam states, movement toward something outside one's own deficient self (in his case, movement toward Eve) is an attempt to further approach the type of perfection that God enjoys. The best example of this movement toward perfection is the fact that Adam and Eve have the potential to one day become angels themselves, a significant step up on the scala naturæ.

Coupled with this emphasis on movement and change is an emphasis on cognitive relativism. That is, the way realities are perceived in the book is dependent on the experience of the character. Satan, rather portentously, is the first to mention this idea of experience as not an absolute, but rather a subjective notion that hinges on past experiences: Me Miserable! Which way shall I fly / Infinite wrath and infinite despair? / Which way I fly is Hell, myself am Hell, / And in the lowest deep a lower deep / Still threat'ning to devour me opens wide, / To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n (IV, 73-78). He expresses a similar sentiment when he spies on Eden's humans and imagines them in hell: More woe the more your taste is now of joy! (IV, 369)

Eve expresses the same relativistic preoccupation, albeit in a much more innocent sense, as she worries that the beauty of Eden is wasted while she and Adam sleep: But wherefore all night long shine [the stars]? For whom / This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes? (IV, 657-8) The footnote to this line further illuminates Eve's meaning: things are not of value in themselves but only as they are perceived and shared (pg 95). Whereas Eve merely ponders such relativism, Adam notes his experience of it, noting that his perfect Eden became even more perfect with the addition of Eve: what seemed fair in all the world seemed now / Mean (VIII, 472-3).

This relativism is linked with the text's emphasis on movement in an important way – it is the human desire for change that allows us new and different perspectives. This link is also crucial for Eve's sense of her own reality and experience. As one who has acquired, in her entire life thus far, only one state of being (in her case, the joy of living in Eden), she is utterly unable to appreciate this happy state. She lacks the crucial variety of experience that allows one to feel not only appreciative of happiness, but to truly understand happiness – for to understand happiness is to experience comparative unhappiness.

It is useful to first examine Adam's creation and movement of happiness, in order to understand how Eve's creation and existence fundamentally differ. As Adam awakens for the first time, his first act is to recognize his dependence on God: fair creatures, tell, / Tell if ye saw how cam I thus, how here. / Not of myself: by some great Maker, then, / In goodness and in pow'r preeminent (VIII, 276-9). His first speech thus establishes himself as the dependent, deficient creature, whose first impulse is to need God: Tell me how may I know Him, how adore (VIII, 280). Yet after God speaks to him, [he] want[ed] still (VIII, 355). Despite his professed happiness, he desires greater happiness, for In solitude, / What happiness? Who can enjoy alone / Or all enjoyment what contentment find? (VIII, 364-366)1 Along with this relativistic pondering, Adam also dislikes the stasis of the prospect of being alone from all eternity (VIII, 406).

Adam's original state is one that questions the reality of his happiness and rejects a static state of being. In response to his question of Is this happiness? he is granted Eve, and can now definitively state  This is happiness. The fact that he is granted two states of being – one pre-Eve and one post-Eve – is enough to allow him a measure of comparison that endows an authority to his feelings. In achieving greater happiness, he is also partially cured of his human deficiency, and better able to approach perfection. Adam's idea of perfection resembles the Platonic creation story of humans, who were perfect in their cylindrical, merged state. Adam desires that Eve be his other half, and adhere/ And they shall be one flesh, / one heart, / one soul (VIII, 498-9).

Adam is also depicted as being changed post-Eve. Not only has he reached a higher plane of happiness, but he has also evolved. As a result of Eve, he senses a Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before (VIII, 475). This evolution, however, isn't quite perfect enough to allow for satisfaction in stasis (which only God can achieve). Instead, Adam is subject to a now constant flow of desire: In all enjoyments else / Superior and unmoved, here only weak / Against the charm of beauty's powerful glance (VIII, 531-3). Desire is never at rest, but instead sweet intercourse, / Of looks and smiles (VIII, 538). As the footnote to this line notes, intercourse here means exchange; literally 'running between'(pg 203). Thus Adam's urge for movement is realized, as his very desire for Eve is kinetic. His understanding of his own happiness has also been achieved, as he has experienced two states of being.

Eve's downfall is that she is not allowed the breadth of experience Adam is, nor his realization of movement. Unlike Adam, Eve is never given the opportunity to understand her own joy; it is simply what is— she is not able to judge it good or bad, as she has no experience to judge it against. Milton demonstrates Eve's lack of ability to understand her condition by portraying Satan's full enjoyment of Eden. Satan, in having the experience of Hell, can fully understand the beauty of Eden: As one who long in populous city pent / Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air / Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe / Among the pleasant villages and farms / Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight (IX, 445-9). Eve is truly incapable of such an understanding of Eden, rendered ignorant in her experience of only one state of being.

Eve's awakening also fundamentally differs from Adam's. Upon realizing consciousness, Eve doesn't immediately sense that she lacks, as Adam does. She instead finds herself to be quite satisfying enough: Pleased [the reflection] returned as soon with answering looks / Of sympathy and love (IV, 464-5). The scenario of Eve immediately yearning for both God and a partner, as Adam does, never materializes; it is clear that her kinetic energy will be directed elsewhere. Eve then disrupts Adam's notions of Platonic union: Yet methought (Adam) less fair, / Less winning soft, less amiably mild / Than that smooth wat'ry image: back I turned (IV, 478-80). In fact, the language of Eve's description of encountering Adam hints at the kinetic nature of her own state, as she was initially unwilling to go to him, using phrases such as What could I do / But follow (IV, 475-6) and thy gentle hand / Seized mine, I yielded (IV, 487-9). It is unfortunate that Eve does not desire Adam as much as he desires her; if she did, it is true she would still not realize her own happiness, but the Fall would have never occurred – the two would have been united when Satan arrived.

Two of Eve's conditions essentially caused the Fall to occur. The first is Eve's inconstancy of desire. Her tendency toward movement differs from Adam's – it is not continually directed toward him, but instead ebbs and flows. She moves from not desiring Adam (above), to desiring him, as when Satan views them in their conjugal bliss: Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles / Wanted, nr youthful dalliance as beseems / Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league (IV, 337-9). She then moves from desiring Adam to tiring of him, when she suggests that they part: Let us divide our labors (IX, 214). The second condition is that Eve is denied the opportunity to understand her own happiness, and will thus move toward change with even more urgency, for she desires a basic measure of comparison.

For Eve, parting from Adam is an attempt to experience the change she yearns for, as is evident in the way she presents her argument. She first expresses frustration with the lack of meaningful change in Eden, calling it a narrow circuit (IX, 323) (certainly no evolution or progress can be tracked on a circuit). She then questions the reality of her happiness: And what is faith, love, virtue unassayed, / Alone, without exterior help sustained?…Frail is our happiness if this be so / And Eden were no Eden thus exposed! (IX, 335-41) Although her argument attempts to persuade Adam that their faith should be tested, she also wants to explore if the state of her happiness is in fact frail, or if it is happiness at all. Despite the narrator's earlier warning, Sleep on / Blest pair and O yet happiest if ye seek / No happier state and know no more! (IV, 773-5), the fact that Eve has been pondering relativism leaves her susceptible to an agent who might propose change. And such an agent soon presents himself.

Satan, who we have previously seen flying around the universe in a prolonged burst of kinetic energy, represents Eve's wish for movement and change. As he tempts Eve, he casts her as one Deterred not from achieving what might lead / To happier life, knowledge of good and evil? (IX, 696-7). Intriguingly, Satan doesn't promise that such knowledge will lead to a happier life, but only that it might. This doesn't discourage Eve, however – she only seeks an altered state in order to experience more fully, not necessarily a happier one. Indeed, she doesn't even truly understand what happiness is. Therefore, it only a matter of course that Satan's promises too easy an entrance won (IX, 734) for he offers exactly what she is looking for. Perhaps surprisingly, Satan's promise holds fast, and Eve experiences the different state that she sought: Experience next, to thee I owe, / Best guide. Not foll'wing thee, I had remained / In ignorance (IX, 807-9). Finally, Eve has the experience be her own judge of happiness and sadness, as she has experienced two states of being: obedience and defiance.

This episode, however, emphasizes the fact that the reality of events is next to irrelevant; it is only Eve's experience of reality that matters. When Eve eats the apple, the narrator notes her pleasure is  Regarded, / such delight till then as seemed / In fruit she never tasted whether true / Or fancied so (IX, 787-9, emphasis mine). The amount of relativist modifiers Milton managed to pack in this one crucial line is impressive in itself. He wants to be certain we understand that Eve's knowledge of good and evil only exists on a subjective personal landscape, unlike God's absolute notions of good and evil. Unfortunately, this type of discernment is the only kind available to humans. Adam was able to experience such discernment in pleasing God with his questions and being granted the gift of Eve. Eve, however, obtained the ability of discernment only by disobeying God. Thus, both acquired the knowledge by altering their states of being.

The Fall is not fundamentally a conflict of love, but rather the unshakable human desire for change and understanding. As this perpetual desire for change is but a byproduct of humans' lack of perfection, the solution to the Fall is almost redundant: humanity fell because of its imperfection.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Contradictions and a Consistent Critique,"Geoffrey Chaucer's writing is able to maintain interest to modern audiences despite having been written approximately six hundred years ago. This continuing fascination is due in no small part to his sharp satirical mind and his unmistakable criticisms of the existing religious hierarchy, particularly vibrant in the Canterbury Tales. From the General Prologue's ironic portraits of the various religious pilgrims to specific tales from and about religious figures, the work uses subtle linguistic variation and blatant criticism to draw attention to inconsistencies and possible points of contention within Chaucer's contemporary religious environment. The Pardoner's portrait, prologue, and tale use both plot-oriented and poetry-oriented contradictions to create a specific and intricate condemnation of common contemporary religious practices that illuminates Chaucer's overarching views on 14th century religious practices.

When examining the Pardoner's portrait, it is important to begin with its placement within the set of pilgrims' portraits. The Pardoner is not grouped with other second estate figures such as the Friar and Monk, but is instead listed among the last of the pilgrims: Ther was also a Reve, and a Millere,/ A Sumnour, and a Pardoner also,/ A Maunciple, and myself- ther were namo (GP I. 542-544). While even the hypocritical, monetary-minded Friar is placed directly after the Monk, the Pardoner appears with the coarsest of the pilgrims. The Miller is the pilgrim who drunkenly interrupts the Host's preferred order of social deference (MP I.3120) and, in doing so, represents the voice of the commoners as opposed to the elite. By placing the Pardoner among these pilgrims, Chaucer (as narrator) is passing judgment on the Pardoner's character and worth. The Pardoner, when judged by the company he keeps, comes off as lowly and somewhat extortionate, especially as the characters of his companions are revealed. The Reeve and the Miller squabble within their tales, introducing a level of crudeness to the tale-telling game quite different than the courtly Knight's Tale implies. The Summoner, with whom the Pardoner appears to be close (GP I. 669), is also criticized heavily (although by the questionably noble Friar), both explicitly in a prologue and figuratively in a tale. Though relations between the characters in the Canterbury Tales are often strained and criticism between characters is often somewhat dubious (easily attributed to or indicative of general social position), Chaucer reserves some of his most outrageously immoral acts for the Miller, Reeve, and the summoner in the Friar's tale. It is no accident that the Pardoner appears alongside these men: as readers become aware of the company the Pardoner keeps, it becomes easier to predict his behavior and characterization.

Even among this undesirable group of ruffians, the Pardoner's portrait comes last and is noticeably concerned with his appearance. Nine full lines (GP I. 675-681) are devoted to the way in which he wears his hair, a seemingly irrelevant detail but one which helps illustrate the ways in which Chaucer is setting him up to be a frivolous religious figure. The Pardoner attempts to cultivate a modern, sleek appearance but instead appears foolish to his companions. The narrator notes his attempt when saying, Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet (GP I. 682). It is important, however, that the Pardoner's reasons for wearing his hair as he does are attributed to his mind rather than a shared sense of style. The Pardoner thinks he is up to date and fashionable, but Chaucer gives no hints that his self-evaluation is correct. The use of adjectives such as thynne and dischevelee, as well as a direct comparison to flax, imply a certain distaste for the Pardoner's sense of style amongst the group as a whole and creates a noticeable gulf between the Pardoner's personal evaluations and consensus opinions. Adding to this sense of critique is the emergence of a primarily physical description: the Pardoner's portrait places equal emphasis on his appearance and his possessions, allowing for his demeanor in religious duties and preaching mostly at the end of his portrait and then only as an afterthought. The primary view of the Pardoner that Chaucer offers is that of a man trying incredibly hard to appear legitimate and on the cutting edge of society, only to fail and worrying excessively over his appearance.

Following this description of the Pardoner as overly concerned with physicality (and also incorrectly applying that concern) is an interesting rhyme that recalls the beginning of the portrait and illuminates Chaucer's early bias against the Pardoner. Chaucer directly belittles the Pardoner's sense of stature and papal connections when he is Bretful of pardoun comen from Rome al hoot./ A voys he hadde as small as hath a goot (GP I. 687-688). The line concerning Papal pardons is sandwiched between a note about the Pardoner's sack and of his apparently grating voice, rhyming with goot and forming a decidedly unfavorable comparison. By associating the line about pardons with the goat, a traditional implication of Satan, Chaucer is commenting, although slightly and indirectly, on the quality of the Pardoner's supposed absolution. This decidedly negative connotation sets up another comparison to brutish animals (horses, GP I.691) and immediately precedes the direct discussion of the Pardoner's methods. More importantly, however, it is a repetition of a poetic technique used at the very beginning of the portrait, before any discussion of the Pardoner's appearance. The unlikely and almost blasphemous juxtaposition of Rome with trivial or inhuman elements in fact occurs twice within the portrait, and though the first comparison is to a song (not as overtly devilish as a goat), the rhyme in both cases trivializes Rome and the act of pilgrimage itself. Where the opening of the portrait could easily lead into a discussion, or even condemnation, of the Pardoner's actions, Chaucer instead digresses into a treatise on appearance. The Pardoner has come straight from Rome (GP I.671), but apparently all he has to show for it is a jolly attitude and penchant for singing love songs. The direct rhyme between Rome and to me in the first lines and the close connection between visiting Rome and having the voice of a goat undermine the Pardoner's attempts at spiritual gravity and set up the direct condemnations that follow.

Chaucer's narrator is not subtle in criticizing the Pardoner and his physical attributes, but he is ruthless when describing the Pardoner's possessions. While the other General Prologue portraits tend to be forgiving and positive in their descriptions, the Pardoner is openly ridiculed throughout. The narrator repeatedly trumps the Pardoner's voice: gone are the ventriloquisms of the Friar and Prioress. With regards to the Pardoner, Chaucer is markedly skeptical: lines 695 and 696 repeat he seyde when referring to the Pardoner's possessions. The repetition underlines the lack of trust and respect towards him; he is not taken seriously for a second and his words are repeated to draw ridicule. Chaucer's repetition here draws attention to the separation between narrative voice and character voice in the Pardoner's portrait, and while this makes the ventriloquism of earlier portraits more easily recognizable, it distances the reader from the Pardoner and excludes the possibility of sympathy. Compounding the Pardoner's already considerable problems of credibility is the outright dismissal of his relics. When he seyde that his relics had certain origins, there is a possibility that the Pardoner is correct. This room for vindication is removed when the narrator refers to a certain relic solely as pigges bones (700); these are not even afforded the Pardoner's description but are dismissed immediately as fakes.

Chaucer deliberately breaks form and openly despises and distrusts the Pardoner from his first observations of physical appearance to a description of occupation and preaching. The description of the Pardoner's normal mode of operation is unsurprisingly unsympathetic given the portrait's general treatment of his character. It is no surprise that the Pardoner uses feyned flattery and japes, along with his false relics, to get moore moneye/ Than that [a poor] person gat in monthes tweye (GP I.703-705): the portrait has been laced throughout with references to deceit and a fundamental disconnect between the Pardoner's presentation of reality and a reasonable construction thereof. This straightforward examination (and implied condemnation) is, however, unique to the Pardoner's portrait and conspires along with its placement to belittle the Pardoner at every turn and even when the Pardoner is granted talent (his resemblance to a goat does not impede his singing of offertories (GP I.710)), he is roundly abused. Chaucer intends his praise of the Pardoner's singing ironically, focusing on an already negative trait and linking good deeds only to the prospect of financial gain.

The Pardoner's portrait is throughout brimming with irony and contradictory phrases and rhymes that offset any religious authority the man might have. The lengthy focus on appearance does not deviate entirely from Chaucer's previous representations of religious figures, but it does place an unusual emphasis on the Pardoner's deliberate attempts to seem admirable. Whereas Chaucer simply presents the table manners of the Prioress (GP I.127-135), the Pardoner's portrait focuses on the distinction between personal presentation and actuality. By proposing reasons behind the Pardoner's actions, Chaucer contradicts his previous stance of absolute naiveté and shows a level of perception difficult to gauge from the preceding portraits. This essential contradiction in the narrator's demeanor is present amongst contradictory passages within the text itself. Rhymes that couple holy Rome with frivolity or, worse, devilry force readers to consider the holiness of this religious figure and, as an extention, the religious system itself. A religious climate that encourages absolution at (literally) any price is subtly criticized when a figure embodying its contradictions is held up to direct and unsparing scrutiny.

It is not only in his General Prologue portrait that the Pardoner is criticized; his prologue and tale go further in presenting contradictory condemnations of his preaching and practice. The Pardoner is again routinely attacked from the moment he is asked to tell a tale. The tale he follows is the Physician's Tale, a story concerned with moral purity; the Pardoner is conceived as its antidote. Telle us som myrthe or japes right anon (ParI VI.319) commands the Host, assuming that the Pardoner is not to be taken seriously and also assuming that his tale would, as a matter of course, lack sufficient gravity. The Pardoner is viewed as comic relief instead of as a legitimate religious representative or member of the second estate. As in the General Prologue, the Pardoner is placed on a relatively equal footing with the Miller and Reeve, each of whom told humorous tales of no great moral consequence; the Pardoner is expected to do the same. He obliges in good faith, but not before another criticism is leveled. The Host does not want the Pardoner to drink before telling his story, to which the Pardoner replies, I moot thynke/ Upon som honest thyng while that I drynke (ParI VI.327-328). The tale that the Pardoner ends up telling, however, is a repetition of the sermon he usually delivers to the masses, as far from an honest thyng as he can come. He attempts to fleece his fellow pilgrims, a dishonest action itself stemming from the inability to think of an honest thing even after claiming to attempt to do so. There are two levels of dishonesty and contradiction stemming from this line alone, the line that introduces the Pardoner's portion of the Canterbury Tales, defining it (at least in retrospect) as a particularly tricky and devious part of the collection.

Even more striking than the Pardoner's inability to succumb to drunken honesty (potentially excusable on account of drunkenness but important nonetheless) is the Pardoner's completely incorrect illustration of a Biblical verse. The Pardoner is a religious figure who preaches Radix malorum est Cupiditas (ParP 334) just before attempting to lull his audience into trust and, eventually, extort radical payments for dubious coupons of salvation. This is hypocrisy in its barest form: the Pardoner undermines what he preaches by exercising the precise opposite. His character is defined by greed and a love of money. In choosing this Biblical maxim to represent the Pardoner, Chaucer is calling attention to the problems inherent within a church that allows such practices without openly condemning them. In presenting the Pardoner as completely and entirely outrageous, viewed as nothing but a joke by his companions, Chaucer is placing religious criticism in the mouth of a buffoon, making it more tolerable and easing it into the fabric of the Canterbury Tales.

What the Pardoner does through his tale is symbolize an industry of religion that develops throughout the Pardoner's entire performance. The Pardoner sets the mood by beginning with scripture presuming that, when he comes to undermine it later, his audience will not notice or will be too ashamed not to contribute to the pot, believing that the Pardoner does not accept money from any wight…That hath doon synne horrible (ParP 378-379). This backwards method of enforcing compliance (and lining the Pardoner's pockets) turns religion into a social practice and draws it away from themes of repentence or absolution: a person hearing the tale who thickens the Pardoner's coffers may be doing so not out of a desire for absolution but to avoid seeming sinful to his neighbors. The sleight of hand practiced by the Pardoner uses scripture to promote the avarice it explicitly forbids.

Taken alone, the Pardoner becomes a reprehensible individual who does not necessarily stand in for the church as a whole. Chaucer includes other religious figures in his work who seem more reasonable and, in the case of the Parson, are ideal representations of the religious life. The Pardoner is obviously intended to stand out and embody precisely everything wrong with religion: when Chaucer openly criticizes the Pardoner in his portrait, he is criticizing the specific character and maybe his profession as a whole, but the critique seems limited in scope. Chaucer builds on contradictions within the Pardoner's portrait and the fundamental contradiction of his tale to create a criticism of pardoners, who come to represent money in religion. After reading the Pardoner's attempts to fleece his flock, however, it is important to revisit the earlier religious portraits and observe how they are more like the Pardoner than is at first obvious.

The Pardoner's Prologue and Tale are built on the contradiction between the Pardoner's words against greed and his greedy action; the intended effect is to enforce the original scripture (Radix malorum est Cupiditas) by presenting its abhorrent opposite. Easily forgotten in the Pardoner's extravagant flaunting of his own teachings are the contradictions within the Prioress's, Monk's, and Friar's portraits, which focus just as much on social status and physical appearances as does the Pardoner's, though they are treated with a certain degree of respect. Madame Eglentyne, for example, is ful simple and coy in the second line of her description (GP I.119); Chaucer goes on to speak of the characteristics of her voice and her wonderful table manners. The Monk is an excellent horseman who blatantly ignores the fact that traditional practice seith that hunters ben nat hooly men (GP I.178). His religious faults are masked within a venerating attitude of the adoring narrator, but it is clear that the Monk is more concerned with social status and the pursuits of the leisure class than living a sparse monastic life. The Friar is the worst offender of all, closely linked to the Pardoner through their mutual love of money. Though he hadde maad ful many a mariage/ Of yonge women at his owene cost (GP I.212-213), he is described as a member of a povre ordre (GP I.225). Both the Friar and the Pardoner embody precisely the opposite ideals than those they profess, and though the Friar is admired by Chaucer's narrator, he is no less guilty of similar sins.

The Pardoner is only the most obvious of the religious sinners in the Canterbury Tales, and when the standards he implies are applied to the other second estate pilgrims in Chaucer's group, each one fails. The Prioress and Monk seem to excel at the type of posturing for which the Pardoner is ridiculed, forging identities outside of their religious vows and adopting the manners and hobbies of the leisure classes despised by the Biblical aversion to greed and wealth. The Pardoner serves as a key to unlock the deep religious criticism in the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer's obvious contempt towards the Pardoner dwarfs the subtlety of his other religious critiques but illuminates his vision of proper religious practice. The Pardoner is crafted to show where Chaucer stands and to elicit agreement; viewing the previous portraits with an eye towards Chaucer's ultimate end draws out contradictions within them and reveals that they are not so unlike the Pardoner themselves. The staggering inability of the clergy to follow one of the most basic tenets of the Bible and of the vows specific to their orders is a direct condemnation of the commercial nature of the 14th century church, a condemnation that flows from the disconnect between religious preaching and religious practice. This is borne out most fully by the reviled Pardoner but becomes evident in earlier portraits as well as the religious overtones of the Canterbury Tales congregate to form a unified vision of where, exactly, religion is going wrong.",0,0,0,0,18076
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Sexualized Violence and Identity in Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo,"Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo is composed of seemingly isolated incidents of sexualized violence. However, these moments of violence are connected by an undercurrent of trauma resulting from identities fragmented by colonial constructions of power and by displacement. Throughout the novel, these isolated incidents are denied or left unacknowledged, resulting in a growing sense of discomfort that culminates in a moment of narrative rupture when Jimmy sexually abuses Rosa. Jimmy's actions cannot be ignored or denied, and thus they finally raise the question of whether it is possible to have a resolution or whether this trauma will always be a part of the Casas family's life in America. In the novel, homosexual protagonist Juani Casas family's refusal to acknowledge her sexuality situates her as an outsider, while her violent act enmeshes her in the midst of the Casas family's unspoken cycle of violence. It is from this simultaneous position of outsider and active perpetrator of conflict and denial, that Juani is able to demonstrate at the very least, the need for open communication in the exiled Cuban community, in order to break the cycle of violence.

The Las Casas family's Cuban history is defined by colonialism. In her article, Marked by Genetics and Exile: Narrativizing Transcultural Sexualities in Memory Mambo, Kate McCullough writes,

The colonial legacy of violence inherent in racial formation, for example, vexes the family's account of its genealogy. Juani's mother's desire, for instance, emerges from this matrix: a ""café con leche mulata,"" she will ""do just about anything to deny her real lineage,"" and she considers Juani's father, ""green-eyed and very light-skinned,"" a ""prize"" (32). 584

Juani's mother occupies a unique position, because she was born into a newly independent Cuban society, yet a society that still contained the social hierarchy and racism of its colonized past. As a privileged member of this society, Juani's mother has internalized the racist colonial stereotypes, desiring to deny her real lineage (Obejas, 32). McCullough points out that Juani's mother objects not to the colonial system itself but to its micropractices; she objects neither to the sexual violence implicit in slavery nor even to the consequent racial hierarchies, but simply to the possibility that her family does not occupy a privileged position within them (McCullough, 585). This is further demonstrated by Juani's family's immigration to the United Stats, which is driven by Juani's mother after witnessing the revolution in 1959. Juani states, When the revolution triumphed in 1959, nothing stunned my mother more than the fact that crazy Raul and his black friends were riding on tanks with Fidel through the city…In that instant, my mother—who'd been struggling to pass her entire life—could see that the order of things had just been altered (Obejas, 35).

Juani's mother drives the Las Casas family to leave Cuba, because she cannot cope with the idea of a society without hierarchal definitions and the power imbalances they create. Though Juani's mother never actually experiences colonialism, she exhibits the distorted identity typical of a member of a colonized society. Bart Moore-Gilbert discusses Homi Bhabha's concept of mimicry in his book Post Colonial Theory: Contexts, Practices, Politics stating,

The colonizer requires of the colonized subject that s/he adopt the outward forms and internalize the values and norms of the occupying power…At the heart of mimicry, then is a destabilizing 'ironic compromise'…the desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of a difference that is almost the same, but not quite. (Moore-Gilbert, 120)

Bhabha's concept of mimicry demonstrates one of the inherent contradictions in colonialism, the desire to create a subject that is almost the same, but not quite (Moore-Gilbert, 120). The colonizers' attempt to mold the colonized culture to their own, yet their refusal to fully accept them or acknowledge them as the same, inculcates the colonized culture with their stereotypes, while at the same time denying them power and mobility. Moore-Gilbert goes on to state that,

The consequence of this, however, is quite contrary to the 'intention' of the colonizer, in that mimicry produces subjects whose 'not-quite sameness' acts like a distorting mirror which fractures the identity of the colonizing subject and—as in the regime of stereotype- 'rearticulates [its] presence in terms of its ""otherness,"" that which it disavows.'(Moore-Gilbert, 121).

By attempting to produce not-quite sameness (Moore-Gilbert, 121), the colonizers actually generate identities in the colonized culture that are distorted and confused because their attempts to be the same, only demonstrate their differences. I will argue that it is this fractured identity combined with the feelings of displacement that is largely responsible for the linked moments of sexualized violence present in Memory Mambo. In the Casas family, there is an added layer of complexity to this fractured identity. Kate McCullough discusses how  Juani's mother's scripting of the family thus involves not only rewriting the past but producing the terms of the future (McCullough, 586). By fleeing to America,, Juani's mother is able to rewrite the past on her own terms, yet in doing so, she denies a past of racial impurity. McCullough argues that for the Casas family, Cuban exile results from a ﬂight not simply from communism but from a new racial order made possible by Cuba's revolutionary social restructuring and the new forms of desire it might open (McCullough, 586). I will also attempt to demonstrate that by denying her family's past in an attempt to produc[e] the terms of the future (McCullough, 586), Juani's mother further fractures the Casas identity and condemns her family to a future of the sexualized violence inherent in racial formation (McCullough, 584) and to further exile.

Juani Casas, Memory Mambo's protagonist has an identity further fractured by her homosexuality. For Juani, the impact of exile and her family's re-written identity leaves her aimless and unsure of what she wants. She states, I loved running the business, making decisions, having the respect of my family. But in my heart, I could not see myself here…The problem was, unlike Nena, who'd always wanted that PR career she was now off to in Miami, I had no clue what I could, or wanted, to do (Obejas, 97). Juani's confusion over her identity is increased when she falls in love with Gina, the Puerto Rican independentista. Juani does not consider herself to be political so she goes along with Gina's strong political beliefs stating, I really didn't care if she was a raving communist or a self-hating queer. Nothing mattered, nothing except the urgent, slippery sweetness between us (Obejas, 78). While Juani states that she does not care if Gina is a raving communist or a self-hating queer, the reality is that she can not ignore Gina's selectivity in choosing political causes worthy of a fight, because they affect their relationship, and ultimately destroy it. Juani finds that while she does not feel strongly about Cuban politics, in her relationship with Gina, she cannot escape them. Juani does not understand how Gina can ardently fight for Puerto Rican independence, while contentedly living the life of a closeted lesbian. Juani tells how Gina would respond to her discussion of queer politics: That's so white, this whole business of sexual identity' she'd say, while practically undoing my pants. ‘But you Cubans, you think you're white… (Obejas, 78). Though Juani tries to ignore how politics negatively affects her relationship, eventually she cannot help but notice the problems caused by her and Gina's different political beliefs.

After a year of dating, Gina tells Juani that she is not very happy with [their] relationship anymore…she [is] tired of coming over to my family's house and having to put up with my relatives, especially the men, making Puerto Rican jokes all the time, acting like Cubans were god's gift to the world (Obejas, 122). Though Juani's homosexuality isolates her from her family, Juani is deeply influenced by her family and is unable to form an identity outside of them. Kate McCullough states that Obejas' novel

Locates its heroine in an extended Cuban American family that is itself located in larger, overlapping political contexts. Juani moves through the world of the novel in relation to her parents, sisters, cousins, tíos, and tías, so her identity is produced in a largely heterosexual, ethnically marked community in which her lesbianism is tacitly understood but rarely explicitly recognized. Obejas argues that ""culturally we're deﬁned by our families. In Memory Mambo, Juani doesn't just function in the world as a lesbian. Mostly she functions in the world of her family. Her community is her family""(McCullough, 583).

Juani is deeply entangled in a large family with racist beliefs; her relationship with Gina does exist in a utopic world where politics do not matter. Juani constantly feels torn between her loyalty to her family, their traditions and their sense of humor and her love for Gina. She is unable to stand up to her family and tries to explain her family's disrespect away saying, I told her it was just a Cuban cultural thing, a generational thing, a Jimmy thing, but none of my words had any weight (Obejas, 123). Juani's fractured identity becomes increasingly evident in her relationship with Gina because in contrast to Gina who is strong and convicted in her beliefs, Juani appears weak and unable to stand up both to Gina, and to her family.

It is this growing sense of confusion and lost identity that causes Juani to finally lash out at Gina with violence. The night of Juani and Gina's fight, one of Gina's friends calls Juani a Gusana, a bad Cuban. Juani asks Gina it is so despicable (Obejas, 132) that her family left Cuba, because her and Gina would never have met otherwise. But when Gina asks Juani whether she would have left Cuba if given the choice, Juani is speechless. She thinks, Who would I have been in Cuba? Who could I still be, in Cuba or here? (Obejas, 133). She realizes that she remembers little of Cuba but snatches of color and scattered words and wonders What did I really know? And who did I believe? Who could I believe?..Suddenly, I hated that I was just sitting there like a big black hole, like the mouth of one of those big industrial washers into which everybody just throws all their dirty clothes (Obejas, 133). After listening to Gina and her friends how much they know about Cuba, Juani finally recognizes her lack of identity and is furious. Juani does not know how to respond to her feelings of loss and displacement and lashes out at Gina with violence. Juani and Gina both end up at the hospital, where Caridad's husband Jimmy sees them and crafts a story to tell the rest of the family. Jimmy tells everyone that Juani and Gina were attacked in Ginas' apartment, and that because Gina believes it was politically motivated, Juani thinks it is too dangerous to be around Gina, so the two are parting ways. Juani allows her family to believe Jimmy's story and refuses to tell the truth about what truly happened between her and Gina.

It is particularly significant that Jimmy creates Juani's cover story and hides the true nature of what happened between Juani and Gina, because one of the most interesting parallels drawn in the book is between Juani Casas, and Jimmy. Jimmy is also a perpetrator of domestic violence and he also has an identity that is fractured and confused by his experiences as a post-colonial Cuban exile. As the only out homosexual in her Cuban-American family, Juani feels an increased sense of displacement, because she is displaced from Cuba, and also feels alienated by her family. Jimmy feels a similar sense of loss, because he is displaced from his home, Cuba, but also feels isolated and alienated from his family. When Caridad first meets Jimmy, he tells her how he had been sent to the U.S. by himself on the Mariel boatlift, how he'd nearly died from dehydration and had to be hospitalized for weeks (Obejas, 43). Jimmy experiences the violence and trauma inherent in post-colonial Cuba and exile from Cuba at a young age. The Catholic Church places Jimmy with an American family in Indiana, who were kind to him but different from everything he'd ever known (Obejas, 44). Jimmy feels isolated from his American family, but does not realize how Americanized he has become until his real sister showed up from Cuba years later and he came to live with her, he didn't know her, and didn't know how to be with her. He'd say 'excuse me' all the time, preferred Folgers and eggs to Bustelo and toast for breakfast, and couldn't dance to save his life (Obejas, 44). Jimmy grows up without any clear sense of identity—of who he is, or where he belongs. It is this anger over his displacement and his inability to belong in either world (Obejas, 44) that causes Jimmy to lash out at Caridad.

One of the significant features of both Juani's and Jimmy's acts of violence is that they are perpetrated against loved ones. Both Juani and Jimmy have profound feelings of loss, yet they target those who are close to them. By targeting loved ones within their own community, it is as though Juani and Jimmy implicate the entire exiled Cuban community in their feelings of displacement, because no one is sure who to blame for them. However, there are unique features to the violence within Caridad and Jimmy's relationship that distinguish their relationship from Juani and Gina's relationship. Caridad and Jimmy's relationship is based on power imbalances and a desire to dominate one another. Though Caridad is initially drawn to Jimmy out of sympathy for the experiences he has had, their relationship quickly becomes about control and domination. Within the first twenty pages of Memory Mambo, Jimmy and Caridad fight because Caridad's father died and left her money and she wants to use it to buy a car, and Jimmy says no, they don't need a new car (Obejas, 15). However, the power imbalances in their relationship become immediately clear when Jimmy states that they have plenty of other debts to pay before buying something that luxurious. Besides, he sneers, where the hell does Caridad think she's going to go without him anyway (Obejas, 15). Jimmy immediately frames Caridad as the subordinated member of the relationship because she not only has to ask him for permission to use her own money, but also because by denying Caridad her own car, Jimmy denies Caridad her own sense of mobility and independence.

However, in spite of Jimmy's control over her, Caridad maintains her own form of compromised agency. Caridad likes the dangers that come with men too, especially certain Latino men…It's not that she likes getting beat up…in fact, she hates it—but she relishes the role she gets to play in bringing down her bad boys. She likes making strong men weak… (Obejas, 17). Caridad and Jimmy's power dynamics are highly sexualized, with Jimmy using his masculinity to dominate Caridad because he is physically stronger, while Caridad uses her sexuality to dominate him. Juani tells how, after making Jimmy come, [Caridad] just loves to look at him, all wet and red and shrunken, as helpless and beautiful as a newborn baby (Obejas, 17). Both Caridad and Jimmy are enmeshed in the exiled post-colonial Cuban community and their fractured identities cause them to seek roles that alternatively subordinate and empower them.

Jimmy's obsession with domination also plays out in his relationship with Juani. Jimmy does not like Juani, and does not want Juani interacting with Caridad. The first time Caridad leaves Juani and Jimmy alone, Jimmy sits on the couch, rubbing his penis until he has an erection. He then asks Juani, You ever want one of these?...Not inside you, but like, one of your own? (Obejas, 19). But Juani responds with cockiness stating, I get what I want; know what I mean (Obejas, 20). The two then sit while Jimmy loses his erection and Juani watches. Juani states, It was like a stand-off: dangerous, yes, but also just plain exhilarating. I went home that night and got off a dozen or so times just playing that scene in my head (Obejas, 20). Though Jimmy and Juani live in an exiled Cuban community, the politics of colonialism and the ways in which they play out in desire remain present. Of the characters in the Memory Mambo, Juani and Jimmy have arguably the most fractured and confused identities, and they are the two perpetrators of sexualized violence in the novel. Juani and Jimmy's struggle to define themselves results in violence against their partners, but also in a desire to remain in control of their lives and the people in them. Kate McCullough reiterates this point stating,

Indeed Juani and Jimmy have been repeatedly ﬁgured as doubles, from his claim at the outset that ""Juani's just like me, we're two of a kind. . . . She'd do anything"" to Caridad's comment that the two are ""so alike"" (20, 144). Specifying the terms of the comparison, Caridad claims, to Juani's horror, that "". . . you two react to things the same way. . . . you talk alike, you even stand alike"" (145) Signiﬁcantly, Caridad's words suggest that Juani and Jimmy's similarity is ultimately grounded in control and a shared capacity for violence (McCullough, 598).

Juani and Jimmy's struggle for power situates both characters simultaneously as doubles of one another and as rivals. Throughout the text, Jimmy uses his penis as a threat and as a weapon when he is trying to intimidate Juani or prove a point. When Jimmy tells Juani to stay away from Caridad, he hisses Do you fucking hear me, you little dyke? and then bumps her with his pelvis. He later gives himself an erection and asks Juani if she is jealous of his penis, telling her Maybe things would have worked out with you and Gina if you could have given her one of these huh? (Obejas, 56). Because Juani is a lesbian and is self-described as fairly masculine, tall, kind of big-boned and flat-chested—tomboyish too— (Obejas, 20), for Jimmy, his penis is the most significant defining characteristic between Juani and himself, and he finds power in his masculinity.

Interestingly, the healthiest relationships in the novel are among women who marry or date outside of the Cuban community. Juani's older sister Nena, moves to Miami and falls in love with Bernie Beck, who is black and half-Jewish. When Juani goes to visit Nena, she states It was wild to watch my normally tense and serious sister so playful and happy, as carefree as a co-ed during the first few days of school (Obejas, 171). The fact that one of the most successful relationships in the novel requires Nena to find a mate outside of the Cuban community reflects not only on the Cuban community but also on the Casas family. Juani states, I am as marked by genetics and exile as everyone else. . . . But...I'm also a stranger in my own family (79). Kate McCullough comments on Juani's feelings of alienation stating, If [Juani's] lesbianism emerges from the context of exile, then, it simultaneously constitutes a more metaphorical form of exile for her: exile within or from the family. However, I would argue that McCullough's assertion should be taken a step further. Though Juani's homosexuality increases her feelings of alienation from her family members, many of the other Casas family members experience exile within or from the family. In order to find happiness, Nena has to hide the truth about her boyfriend from her family, and has to leave Chicago to find herself. Nena tells Juani that even though I know [Mami's] whole thing about skin color is bullshit, it kept haunting me. You see, I know I would never give Bernie up because she won't approve, but I also know that my being with him is going to torture her, even though her reasons are totally fucked up (Obejas, 190). Nena demonstrates that while the insular Cuban exile community preserves tradition and memories, it can also be very detrimental to her generation. Instead of allowing herself to feel exiled within her family and community, Nena deliberately puts distance between herself and her family to develop her own identity and find happiness.

Though Nena chooses to move to Miami so that she does not hurt her family with her choices, one of the most significant issues within the Casas family is that problems are either denied or simply not addressed. Though the entire family knows that Jimmy beats Caridad, no member of the family will confront Caridad. One day at the laundromat with Juani and Juani's mother, Tia Celia states, Being loyal to your husband does not mean letting him hit you (Obejas, 96). Yet, though Tia Celia acknowledges the violence, she refuses to talk to Caridad about it. Similarly, Juani's parents and the other members of their generation refuse to acknowledge Juani's homosexuality, though her girlfriends are present at family occasions. Even after the incident with Gina,, Juani tries to tell her mother that Jimmy exaggerated the story, and her mother responds whispering, Juani, no. Don't torture yourself with this. There are some things that are better left unspoken (Obejas, 141). However, it is this silence that is the common thread between the many isolated incidents of violence in the novel. Jimmy begins harassing Juani early on in his relationship with Caridad, yet Juani refuses to tell Caridad about Jimmy's grotesque sexual displays toward her. Jimmy crafts a story about the fight between Juani and Gina, and Juani hides behind his story and refuses to take responsibility for her actions. Finally, even though Jimmy's repeated abuse of Caridad is condemned in the family, no one speaks out against it. Throughout the novel, the Casas family members refuse to speak out against the different forms of violence occurring and none of the characters question when or how it will stop.

In the final twenty pages of the novel, there is a scene of violence so reprehensible that the Casas family must finally acknowledge its occurrence. When Juani's cousin Pauli is confronted by the father of Rosa, her illegitimate child, Juani and Jimmy are left alone in the house with Rosa. Juani falls asleep and in a moment of narrative rupture, wakes up to witness Jimmy forcing baby Rosa to perform oral sex on him. Juani yanks Rosa off of Jimmy, just as most of the family bursts into the room and chaos breaks loose. Unlike the other highly private moments of sexualized violence in the novel, many members of the family witness this incident. It is though all of the repressed feelings and thoughts about past violent acts finally surface, as there is an explosion of sound: chains rattling, wood cracking as if in a fire (Obejas, 222). Ali, Rosa's father, hurls Jimmy around the room, and Pauli and Caridad begin to fight. The only people who stay out of the fight are Tia Celia, who comforts Rosa, and Juani, who is on the floor, worthless (Obejas, 223). Though Juani is the one to save Rosa, Jimmy's actions also implicate her. Jimmy stops the fighting by looking toward Juani begging her to tell them what really happened (Obejas, 224). When Juani is unable to speak, Jimmy turns on her yelling, I helped you, you stupid bitch, I helped you! (Obejas, 225), terrified and unsure what to do, Juani runs away. When Juani's cousin Patricia comes to find her, Juani is sitting in a coffee shop by herself doodling dots on a napkin, pretending it is a letter to their cousin Titi. Patricia tells Juani that everything will actually be okay, and Juani points to one of the dots on the napkin telling Patricia, This is the part where I tell Titi about what really happened with Gina (Obejas, 237). Jimmy's final act of violence is so unspeakable, that it finally breaks the silence surrounding the violence always present in the family. At the same time, Jimmy's act also forces Juani to speak up, because she does not want to hide behind the story that Jimmy crafted for her any longer.

In Memory Mambo, the denied feelings of loss and displacement behind the different acts of violence are all exposed in Jimmy's final violent act. Though all of the characters in the novel have identities fractured in some ways by colonial stereotypes and exile, Juani and Jimmy arguably have the most difficulty defining their identities and feeling a sense of belonging. Juani and Jimmy are set up as doubles throughout the text; both have a propensity for control and both react violently toward their significant others. However, the end of the novel distinguishes Juani from Jimmy. With his horrific sexual abuse of Rosa, Jimmy continues the cycle of violence, while Juani chooses to try to stop it by speaking out, and telling the truth for once. In doing so, Juani begins to discover who she is and to come to terms with her feelings of loss and alienation. Juani begins the novel feeling lost and with little concept of her identity as a Cuban-American lesbian. Though Juani acts out in violence toward Gina, she also serves as an example for the rest of her family. The rest of the Casas family members have fractured identities and experiences feelings of loss and displacement, yet Juani experiences so many blatant contradictions in her identity, that she has great difficulty finding happiness for herself. While Juani's journey to finding herself does not necessarily offer a resolution to the pain and trauma of exile, it does offer the chance for a less painful future. Juani states: This is always my problem: These overwhelming feelings, this contained madness; to accept, for example, what just happened wit Gina, but without accepting it. What I mean is this: to accept enough, to accept so as to make everyday existence bearable…And then not to accept—how could I accept this madness? To accept it, I think, is to lose hope. I don't mean hope about us, but about me  (Obejas, 233). In finding a way of accepting the disintegration of her relationship with Gina, without truly coming to terms with the violence in the relationship's conclusion, Juani offers a way for Cuban exiles and their children to adjust to life in America. Just as Juani must accept enough…to make everyday existence bearable (Obejas, 233), Cuban-Americans must learn to adapt to life in America, and hold less tightly to their traditions, without giving them up completely. Nena accomplishes this by putting distance between herself and her family, and finding love outside the Cuban community. Nena loves her family and refuses to forsake her identity as a Cuban, but she also learns to embrace her identity as a Cuban-American. Obejas thus demonstrates that though trauma associated with exile and post-colonial Cuba cannot be erased, there are many different ways to find happiness, or at the very least, to make everyday life less painful.",0,0,0,0,26998
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Hermia and Jessica,"At first glance, Hermia of Midsummer Night's Dream and Jessica of Merchant of Venice appear to be similar characters. Both women run away from homes characterized by commanding fathers and absent mothers in order to marry their lovers. Patriarchy is blatantly defied in both situations, but Hermia and Jessica have very different relationships with their fathers and defy them to varying degrees. If the term defy is used in its most malignant context, it means, to renounce faith, allegiance, or affiance to (any one); to declare hostilities or war against (Oxford English Dictionary). By this definition, and assuming that more rebellion equals more success, Jessica is more successful in defying her father. This can be seen through Jessica's hostile relationship with her father, her renunciation of Judaism, and her cruel robbery of Shylock that includes trading his ring for a monkey.

Jessica has a negative relationship with her father, Shylock, which Shakespeare never fully explains. In her second line of the play she declares, Our house is hell (II.iii.2, Merchant). Before she even mentions Lorenzo, Jessica speaks of her father with distain. She goes on to say, Alack, what a heinous sin is it in me/ To be ashamed to be my father's child! But though I am a daughter to his blood,/ I am not to his manners (II.iii.16-19, Merchant). Jessica openly states that she is ashamed to be Shylock's daughter, and though she admits that her feelings are sinful, she does not show any signs of guilt or remorse. She takes comfort that she is not like her father, but she never elaborates on what she finds distasteful in his character. A fair assumption may be that she is unhappy about being born a Jew and that she resents her father for passing on Judaism to her. Jessica loves a Christian man and plans to convert so she can marry him: I shall end this strife,/ Become a Christian and thy loving wife (II.iii.20-21, Merchant). One definition of defy is to renounce faith [to], which Jessica does both in terms of faith as loyalty to her father, as well as faith in a religious sense. Hermia, on the other hand, does not insult her father Egeus's character or oppose him beyond his choice for her husband. His favor for Demetrius appears arbitrary and he lacks a valid argument against Lysander's character, family, or wealth. This portrays Hermia's defiance as less severe and more sympathetic than Jessica's.

In the first scene of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hermia pleads with her father to let her marry Lysander instead of Demetrius. She boldly tells the duke, I would my father look'd but with my eyes (I.i.56, Midsummer). She would rather have her father's blessing than rebel against him, but she feels entitled to a choice in which man she marries. Conversely, Jessica never gives her father the chance to disapprove of her lover. She prepares to run away with Lorenzo in secret, commanding Launcelot to, give him this letter, do it secretly… I would not have my father/ See me in talk with thee (II.iii.7-9, Merchant). Both women speak of their father's sight, but with opposite hopes. Hermia wishes her father would relent and see from her perspective, while Jessica hopes her father remains blind to her scheme to run away. Hermia is ultimately unsuccessful at changing her father's view as the last thing Egeus says in the play is: I beg the law, the law, upon his head. /They would have stol'n away… Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me:/ You of your wife, and me of my consent (IV.i.155-158, Midsummer). Egeus never gives his consent for Hermia and Lysander to marry; it is Theseus who overrules Egeus and gives the lovers his blessing. Jessica, however, is successful at running away with Lorenzo without Shylock discerning her plan.

Ironically, Shylock asks Jessica to take care of his house while he is away, Jessica, my girl,/ Look to my house… Lock up my doors… Let not the sound of fopp'ry enter/ My sober house (II.v.15-36, Merchant). Not only does Jessica disregard her father's orders (as she does earlier when he tries to call her) but she robs the house of its treasures, including a casket of jewels and Shylock's wedding ring. When Tubal informs him that the ring was traded for a monkey, Shylock bursts into hysterics: Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turkis, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys (III.i.120-124, Merchant). Shylock is sympathetic here, especially as the importance of wedding rings becomes integral in Act V when Portia and Nerissa berate their husbands for giving their rings away. Jessica's careless dispense of the ring goes beyond defiant to cruel and vindictive. Hermia, on the other hand, steals only herself from her father's house. She never inflicts the kind of pain on Egeus that Jessica inflicts on Shylock.

If success in defying one's father is measured by the degree of hostility, Jessica certainly achieves more success than Hermia. However, at the end of the plays, Jessica's marriage seems doomed and Hermia's appears successful. When Hermia and Lysander enter after the wedding ceremony, Theseus says, Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth (V.i.27, Midsummer). Little else is said about the couple, but there is no reason to think they will be unhappy. Conversely, the scene between Jessica and Lorenzo at the end of The Merchant of Venice does not bode well for their future. First, they compare themselves to famous lovers whose stories end unhappily. Then Jessica says, Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,/ Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,/ And ne'er a true one (V.i.17-19, Merchant) and Lorenzo replies, Did pretty Jessica (like a little shrow)/ Slander her love… (V.i.21-22, Merchant). This may hide in the guise of playful romantic banter, but Jessica's accusation of false vows, and Lorenzo calling his wife a shrow (meaning shrew) has a serious undertone. Later in the scene the lovers seem to be disconnected and lacking communication. The musicians enter and Jessica says: I am never merry when I hear sweet music (V.i.69, Merchant). Lorenzo replies in a long speech that ends with: The man that hath no music in himself,/ Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,/ is fit for treason, stratagems, and spoils… Let no such man be trusted (V.i.83-88, Merchant). The man Lorenzo speaks of is not literally male, but mankind in an all encompassing sense. He does not seem to notice that this grave accusation of treason and untrustworthiness applies to his new wife, who has just said she is unmoved by music. The fact that Jessica's last line of the play includes I am never merry gives weight to the feeling that the lovers are not going to live happily ever after. It gives the reader cause to question how much Jessica and Lorenzo loved each other in the first place. Jessica may have seen Lorenzo as an opportunity to escape her father and convert to Christianity. Running away and renouncing her faith are never portrayed as a sacrifice or risk for Jessica. Rather, she eagerly betrays her father in a manner that could be construed as careless and hasty.

At the end of The Merchant of Venice Jessica reaps the consequences of betraying her father and her faith, as Portia and the other Christians are unwelcoming. This outsider status could possibly symbolize a future exclusion from Heaven for Jessica. After her escape, Shylock declares, She is damned for it (III.i.31, Merchant), meaning that he believes Jessica is going to Hell for running away from him and becoming a Christian. Lancelot also thinks Jessica will be barred from Heaven as he tells her, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children… for truly I think you are damn'd (III.v.1-6, Merchant). Lancelot does not blame Jessica's sins for her damnation, but rather her father's. However, it remains ambiguous whether Shylock was serious about taking a pound of Antonio's flesh until he learned of Jessica's flight. Her actions were the last straw for him, and after declaring his daughter damned, he gives his famous speech: To bait a fish withal- if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge… Hath not a Jew eyes? (III.i.53-59). Therefore, it's possible that if Jessica had not defied her father, he may have had a change of heart, consequently, alleviating sin from herself. This may be farfetched, but at the end of the play, Jessica remains an outsider. Despite her efforts, she is more like her father than ever, as they are both Christian converts that risk never being accepted by Jews, Christians, and possibly even God. When examined in this light, Jessica's defiance against Shylock has gone terribly wrong.

After close inspection of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and A Merchant of Venice it becomes clear that both Jessica and Hermia are successful at defying their fathers in different ways. If successful defiance is measured by greater rebellion and cruelty, Jessica certainly wins. However, if the daughter's happiness at the end of each play is a better measure for successful defiance, then Hermia's less severe approach achieves more. Ultimately, if success is to be associated with happiness and not the degree of defiance, one must conclude that less is more.",0,0,5,4.64,9271
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Representation of Jesus and Women in the Gospel of Mark,"The Gospel of Mark offers valuable insight into the status and role of women in the early Jesus movement. Not only are there are several stories of Jesus interacting with women in this synoptic gospel, but also there are many moments in Mark where the reader witnesses Jesus speaking to women's issues. These instances of female inclusion in Jesus' sermons, as well as his purposeful involvement of women in his miracles, leave the reader with the strong sense that Jesus is mindful of the plight of women. The reader also observes women being faithful to Jesus in Mark, despite none of them holding the position of disciple, suggesting they too play a vital role in the story of Jesus. The final chapter in the Gospel that describes women fleeing in terror from Jesus' tomb, however, leaves open questions about the positive influence of women in the early Jesus movement. Looking closely at the words Jesus speaks concerning women's issues and briefly at the story of the hemorrhaging woman in Mark 5, it can be determined that the Gospel of Mark purposely gives weight to the exchanges between Jesus and women to enhance its social justice theme as well as gives due importance to the role of women in the Jesus story, while still holding slight reservations about the real nature of Jesus' female followers.

Looking at the Gospel of Mark from a broad, thematic lens, a few specific subject matters emerge that distinguish Mark from the rest of the gospels. Specifically, it is marked by the frequent application of conflict to challenge the Jewish people's faith, as well as makes statements about the interconnectivity of sociopolitical and religious laws, which hints at a social justice theme. The introduction to the Gospel confirms this saying, [I]n this story religion is inseparable from the social, political, economic, even physiological aspects of life (Coogan 56). In a way, the stories and words of Jesus included in the Mark serve to emphasize the importance of social justice in God's will. The introduction mentions that in Mark, Jesus' challenges of the peoples' faith are constantly misunderstood, even surprisingly by his chosen disciples. However, as the introduction also reads, By contrast with the misunderstanding and faithless disciples, women, who play an increasingly prominent role in Mark's story, serve as models of faithfulness … (Coogan 56). Indeed, women are featured in many stories in this gospel, and, more importantly, are included in many of Jesus' sermons to the Jewish people about religious laws and social responsibilities. While women had been included in sermons and laws prior to the time of Jesus as well as in the other gospels, the Gospel of Mark seems to purposefully highlight women, enhancing this notion of the emphasis on social justice in the Gospel.

Looking at specific examples of this social justice theme in Jesus' instructions to the Jewish people and other religious people, there is a fair amount concerning the equal rights of women. The reader first sees this in Mark 10, when the Pharisees and disciples ask him separately about the right of men to divorce their wives. First, to the Pharisees, Jesus quotes what Moses commanded them saying, 'God made them male and female.' … 'The two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. Clarifying this point, he tells the disciples, Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery (vv. 6-12). Thus, Jesus is witnessed giving equal weight to men's and women's actions in divorce. This passage suggests that he sees women as holding equal status to men in the eyes of God, which is an important statement concerning the status of women. The inclusion of Jesus' words to disciples in addition to his words to the Pharisees shows that the author of the Gospel of Mark wanted to emphasize this position that Jesus takes.

Another instance in the Gospel of Mark where the reader witnesses Jesus making a point about the equality of women is in Mark 12. In this chapter, Jesus responds to the Sadducees' concerns of Levirate marriages. They offer Jesus the example of a woman who has married seven brothers out of the conditions of Levirate marriages, and upon her death, still has not bore a child. They ask Jesus whose wife she will be in resurrection. Jesus answers with, For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven (vv. 18-23). While it is not immediately obvious that this discussion between the Sadducees and Jesus concerns the equality of women, especially since Jesus—or the author of the Gospel—did not use the opportunity to condemn Levirate marriage, upon close inspection it appears that Jesus is making the statement that women are free from spousal obligation in death. Jesus is seemingly arguing that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, so women should no longer be a men's possession when they enter God's kingdom.

Other references concerning the importance of female justice in Jesus' instructions are made throughout the Gospels. Even references as subtle as that in Mark 13, reading, Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infant in those days! Pray this it may not be in winter (v. 17), still make the point in the Gospel that Jesus was mindful of women's concerns and poised to include both men and women in his sermons. In addition to Jesus' words on women, there seems to be a steady inclusion of women characters in the Gospel of Mark, stressing Jesus' desire to include all people in his miracles. A story in the Gospel that serves as good examples of Jesus wanting to include women in his healing power and treat women with kindness is the story of the hemorrhaging woman who touched an unsuspecting Jesus in Mark 5. The woman, who had been bleeding for 12 years, touches Jesus cloak while in a crowd, knowing its healing power. Jesus instantly feels her touch and asks who did it. Instead of slipping away unnoticed, the woman fesses up: But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth (v. 33). Instead of rebuking the woman, Jesus blesses her and continues on with his healing. He says to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of you disease (v. 34). This story is important because it shows a seemingly unclean woman taking control of her own healing. As the footnotes read, The initiative and actions are entirely [the woman's], Jesus being a passive conduit through which the healing power goes forth (Coogan 66). This not only shows female empowerment, but also it shows that Jesus is respectful of the woman's bold actions. Undoubtedly, this story was included in Mark to show that Jesus was willing to share his miracles with woman and also was accepting of female authority, making a general statement about the equality of women in his eyes. Jesus' recognition of women and the empowering action of women is repeated in Mark 14, when a female prophet anoints Jesus. While others scolded the woman for wasting ointment, Jesus is grateful. He says, She has done what she could … Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her (vv. 8-9). Jesus accepts the woman's deed and emphasizes that she is showing devotions, something many of the disciples struggle to do. This woman is representative of many women who served Jesus out of their faith and contributed to the Jesus movement. She and the hemorrhaging woman are likely included in Mark's story of Jesus because they are influential females willing to do anything for Jesus, advancing the theme in this Gospel of the positive role of women and their steadfast devotion to God.

This positive aura of women in Mark, however, is obfuscated by the end of the Gospel. Starting Mark 16, after the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to Jesus' tomb to anoint him (which again emphasizes the devotion and faithfulness of women in the story). However, when these women find the tomb opened and a man in a white garment tells them that Jesus has been raised, they are alarmed. The man says, But go, tell disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you (v. 7). The women's response, however, was not continued devotion and trust, rather it was terror. The text reads, So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement has seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid (v. 8). While the statement they said nothing to anyone is contradicted in the two alternate endings, with, All that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter, and [Mary Magdalene] went out and told those who had been with him, the statement still gives off an aura of the women recanting their faithfulness to Jesus and God. The women's fear and initial silence suggest that they are not the ceaselessly devoted followers that previous statements in Mark suggest.

Juxtaposing this ending of Mark with the ending of the Gospel of Matthew, which portrays the women's reactions to finding Jesus missing from the tomb in a much different light, it is clear that Mark is trying to make a point about the role of women with the words the author chooses in Mark 16. The Gospel of Matthew describes a situation similar to that in Mark, saying that an angel appeared to Mary Magdalene and the other Mary at the empty tomb, who instructed the women to tell the disciples that Jesus has been raised from the dead. The reaction of the women is recorded in Matthew as, So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, 'Greetings!' And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshipped him (28: 8-9). So in Matthew, the women were still afraid of the empty tomb, but their joy and faith in Jesus allow them to ignore their terror and run to the disciples and worship Jesus. This is in great contrast to the fearful and concerned responses of the women in Mark, and it suggests that the Gospel of Mark is still questionable about the devotion of women to Jesus despite implying throughout the Gospel that women were devoted followers of Jesus. This is briefly mentioned in the introduction of the Gospel, which reads, [W]omen … serve as models of faithfulness until they flee from the empty tomb (Coogan 56). So, just like the men in the story of Mark, women too have lapses in their faith and question their devotion to Jesus, just as Peter did when he denied being Jesus' disciple. Thus, this abrupt and confusing ending to the Gospel of Mark disrupts readers' impressions of women formed throughout the story. The ending leaves a lot of room for interpretation concerning the influence of women in the story of Jesus and shows that the author of the Gospel still has reservations about the inclusion of women in Jesus' discipleship.

It is important to note that aside from these separate endings to Mark and Matthew concerning the role of women in telling the disciples about the rising of Jesus, similar passages concerning Jesus' interactions with women and views on gender equality can be found in Matthew. Specifically, his instructions to the Pharisees and disciples concerning divorce, as mentioned earlier, are close to those in Matthew 19. Also, the stories of the hemorrhaging woman and the female prophet are seen in Matthew and Luke. So it would be wrong to assert that the importance Jesus gives to women's issues and his positive interactions with women are specific to Mark, as they are echoed in the other synoptic gospels. In fact, it is arguable that the Gospel of Luke includes more references to women and statements about female justice than Mark does, especially looking at the story of the widowed woman arguing with an unjust judge in Luke 18 and Jesus' address to wailing women as the base of his cross in Luke 23.

Nevertheless, women are influential in Mark, especially serving as positive members of Jesus' following and being a main talking point in Jesus' sermons on social justice. Thus, the inclusion of women in Mark may not be unique to the Gospel, but the role of women is still noteworthy and important to Mark's story of Jesus. And what is arguably most important about the role of women in Mark's Gospel is the fact even after having steadfast devotion to Jesus throughout the story, women close to Jesus were still afraid of him and doubted their faith at the end. While it may never be known why the end of the Gospel of Mark was written the way it was, it can be said with assurance that women are viewed as equals to men in the Gospel, both in the eyes of Jesus as well as in their potential to question God's will and their faith.",0,0,10.2,8.19,13019
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Bloom the Critic,"When Odysseus finally reaches Ithaca at the end of The Odyssey, he reclaims his home from the usurping suitors by deceiving them, massacring them, and slaughtering any servant who has served them. When Leopold Bloom finally returns home in Ithaca, he crawls into bed, kisses his unfaithful wife's bottom, and falls asleep.

Allowing Bloom's journey to end with such a thud, Joyce relies on the reader's horror towards the violence and ruthlessness that cap The Odyssey to make Bloom's reconciliatory conclusion seem preferable, if comparatively uneventful. The carnage of Odysseus' return provokes an excitement and disgust of a far more climactic nature than the sentimental satisfaction of Bloom's commitment to Molly and dedication to the damaged marriage, but at least Bloom creates no corpses. Though the conclusion of Ulysses generally affirms Bloom, Molly, and their marriage, one of the sacrifices that this affirmation entails is that the reader must also embrace routine and dullness. Bloom serves not as epic strategist, but rather as epic critic: his strength lies not in his ability to defeat his enemies with cunning and deceit, but to interpret and reinterpret his situation in order to come to terms with it. As a result, he acts with equanimity rather than wrath; with generosity rather than hatred—and while the book positions us to celebrate Bloom for these traits, it also forces us to confront the humdrum status quo that these traits buttress and encourage.

As both the day and Ulysses slouch towards completion in the last few pages of Ithaca, Bloom proceeds through four antagonistic sentiments—envy, jealousy, abnegation, and equanimity—before he can climb into bed next to Molly and fall asleep (602). He endures this task at least in part because of his ability to see Molly's adultery in the broader framework of more serious crimes:

As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder (603). 

In the most immediate sense, this list of crimes is the site where Bloom begins to enable himself to stay with Molly, and it therefore prepares him for the reconciliation that serves as the climax of the novel. After spending the day wandering the streets to avoid having to confront the pain of his wife's infidelity, Bloom makes considerable progress here by coming to terms with the state of his marriage and realizing that Molly's act is not so heinous.

But while the list functions at one level simply to contextualize Molly's deed, it also perpetuates itself for nine lines of text such that, in all of its excess, it mocks contextualization by illustrating the tedium of the process. Bloom has no need to actually compare adultery to every crime from poaching to mutiny on the high seas—the idea that Molly sleeping with Boylan is not so bad becomes evident after only a few examples. But by iterating the list in all its flabbiness, the book demonstrates both the potential dullness of considering alternatives and also the manner in which Bloom's contextualization stymies action. Simply due to its volume, the list serves in part as a grand punctuation mark: it prevents the narrative from progressing as it requires the reader to take note of crime after crime after crime. So while the list is necessary to the narrative in terms of its role in allowing Bloom to return to bed, it also contributes to the depiction of Bloom's requisite dullness through both its redundancy and its length.

The list of crimes and the sections that proceed from it also provide an opportunity to investigate Bloom's role as critic: for Bloom does not react to Molly's adultery so much as he reinterprets it. In order to reach a state of equanimity, Bloom must come to the realization that the deed is As more than inevitable, irreparable (603); whether he murder Boylan, divorce Molly, or simply leave in the middle of the night, Molly's adultery is already in the past. The act itself is now inalterable, which is a fact that presides over Bloom's consideration of retribution: Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic be) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet (603). As Bloom considers his options for vengeance, his first deterrent is the futility of violence; two wrongs did not make one right not only expresses Bloom's moral convictions but also evinces his forward-looking mentality. Whereas Odysseus enacts his vengeance upon the suitors for usurping his house in his absence and finds himself with a mound of corpses, Bloom dismisses such an opportunity after a momentary reflection on its immorality and uselessness.

As Bloom's mind proceeds through possible reactions to Molly's infidelity, he begins to found his justifications for inaction less upon ethics than upon laziness. By the time he considers duel by combat, he does not even offer the type of simplistic moral cliche that he uses to reject assassination; he responds only with a swift no. Bloom's answers to possible forms of retribution continue in like form and start to suggest a blunt unwillingness to act at the moment as he says, not now and not yet. Once again, Bloom does not live up to his exciting predecessor Odysseus as he languorously chooses to delay his reaction. The reader sympathizes with Bloom for being listless after spending the day walking all over Dublin, but at a certain point, Bloom seems willing to climb into bed with Molly simply because he is tired and wants to go to sleep. Although succumbing to sleepiness humanizes Bloom, it also serves as a relatively unremarkable climax for Joyce's modern epic. Joyce provides significant reasons for Bloom to get into bed with Molly, but he forces us to acknowledge some unsatisfying ones as well. The end of the novel does not see the marriage completely fixed, and though we are glad that the marriage begins to look hopeful, we have to temper those hopes with the knowledge that the book only lasts one day and that Bloom and Molly have work left to do.

Bloom accepts that he cannot prevent or avoid Molly's adultery, but he also understands that he can change the way that he perceives her infidelity with his knack for interpretation. In his Philosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein provides a model that helps conceptualize Bloom's ability to transform his relationship to Molly. As he explores the relationship between interpretation and perception, Wittgenstein writes:

This triangle can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical drawing; as standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a mountain, as a wedge, as an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object which is meant to stand on the shorter side of the right angle, as a half parallelogram, and as various other things (200).
By adding so many examples where one or two would suffice, Wittgenstein demonstrates the illimitable potential of interpretation to alter not the triangle itself but what the triangle can be seen as. The same basic tenets hold true for Bloom: though he cannot prevent Molly from sleeping with Boylan, he can mentally transform the event by surrounding it with different narratives and explanations.

Bloom displays his ability to enact such transformations as he justifies to himself his sentiments (Joyce 604). Early in this justification, Bloom reflects upon the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done (604). Beyond reluctantly accepting that Molly's adultery is irreparable, Bloom recognizes that he actually benefits from this fact because he no longer has to bear the tense anticipation of four o'clock. The type of reversal that Bloom achieves here—that he ought to appreciate that Molly has slept with Boylan—demonstrates the extent of his power to reshape his perception of the original occurrence. Though he remains helpless to change what happened, the significance of that helplessness diminishes as Bloom proves himself capable of the more important task of altering the future by reinterpreting the past.

As the justification continues, Bloom actively takes his efforts to a linguistic level such that Wittgenstein's comments—originating upon a discussion of language—become increasingly pertinent:

the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice (604).

Hidden beneath the jargon suited to the faux scientific voice of the chapter lies a language game in which Bloom toys with grammar to better cope with the idea of Boylan and Molly having sex. At stake in Bloom's meddling is his perception of Molly's agency in the act of adultery: switching Molly's grammatical position in the bedroom into the passive voice allows Bloom to entertain the idea that she may have been compliant rather than active. She may even be a victim.

But though the substance of Bloom's reflection may have little or nothing to do with onomatopoeia or aorist preterite situations, the book brings issues of language to the forefront with its technical diction. In one sense, Bloom literally surrounds Molly's adultery with two explanations just like those that Wittgenstein surrounds his triangle with: presumably, he f*cked her and she was f*cked by him. By generating these explications, Bloom enables himself to temper his insecurities about the extent of Molly's faithlessness. To use the language of Wittgenstein, we might say that Bloom can see the infidelity as both an active and a passive act just as we could see the triangle as both a mountain and a wedge. And while the literal reinterpretation of Molly as passive agent in the affair directly helps Bloom, the freedom that these mental movements allow help him indirectly. For while Odysseus utilizes the type of linear thinking of honor and possession that leads to revenge and massacre, Bloom saves himself from such restrictive perspectives and violent actions by finding multiple ways to interpret Molly's sexual encounter with Boylan.

Bloom's final few reflections further clarify his rejection of the Odysseus response: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars (604). In the first two reflections, Bloom openly recognizes the uselessness of the triumph and virtue that justify Odysseus' violence at the conclusion of Homer's epic. These notions are too simple for Bloom, who dismisses them to think instead about Molly's infidelity at a theoretical, scientific level. In a show of interpretive creativity beyond the scope of Odysseus, Bloom thinks about how the nescient matter of which Molly and Boylan's bodies are composed does not care what happened between them. Finally, Bloom concludes by expanding the sphere of his consideration from the body of his wife to the apathy of the stars. The realization that at a grand, cosmic level his wife's infidelity does not signify anything helps Bloom come to terms with the act, but even Bloom's willingness to think on such a broad scale proves that his mind does not imprison itself within the trauma it confronts.

So while the corpses of slaughtered suitors and unfaithful attendants mark the conclusion of Odysseus' journey to reclaim his home, Bloom completes his epic journey through Dublin by kissing his unfaithful wife on the behind and falling asleep. This relatively unremarkable ending results in part from the different roles that the characters play throughout their respective epics: Odysseus the epic strategist and Bloom the epic critic. But even though the prospect of admiring Bloom's effort to reconcile with Molly necessitates a certain willingness to tolerate and even embrace dullness, dullness is much to be preferred to slaughter. The ability to interpret functions in the late scenes of Ithaca as a potentially unifying force—a force that prevents the violence of The Odyssey. And in the years between 1914 and 1921 when Joyce writes Ulysses and Europe simultaneously tears itself apart in the gruesome First World War, Bloom's equanimity provides a new and appreciable trait for the modern hero.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Good People Breaking Rules: Etiquette in Pride and Prejudice and Evelina,"The Oxford English Dictionary defines Etiquette as, [t]he conventional rules of personal behaviour observed in the intercourse of polite society; the ceremonial observances prescribed by such rules (1.c). The purpose of these rules is to allow people to understand the quality of the person with whom they are interacting. By establishing hard and fast rules for interaction, a society is able to weed out the bad apples. At least that is the goal. In Pride and Prejudice as well as in Evelina, an important distinction is necessitated between those who understand and practice etiquette and those who are truly polite and good-natured. Both of these novels show that the practice of etiquette alone cannot serve as an indicator of personal value.

Evelina understands very little of the rules of polite society. When she attends the dance and is pestered into dancing with Willoughby, she violates the rules by telling him that she had been previously engaged to dance when in reality she had not. When she is caught in her lie, she becomes flustered and unable to speak. This is evident in the addition of the dash into all of her spoken sentences. I hope not,-- I beg that—I would not for the world—I am sure I ought to—to— (Burney, 47). These dashes are used to show the vocal breaks that she is making in the dialogue and to show her confused and distracted state of mind. The reason for her agitation is that Willoughby has just alerted Orville to the fact that Evelina has made it seem that she was engaged to dance with Orville during the night. Being caught in this lie, Evelina is trying in vain to find some way to get herself out of the situation. Her intention was simply to avoid dancing with Willoughby and in her attempts to let him down easy, she began to break the rules laid out by etiquette, and once this breech in the rules of the dance was made, Willoughby knew that he had leverage to manipulate her. Evelina in this instance has no rude or insolent motivation. She simply does not want to dance with Willoughby. Yet, because of the rules of decorum, she ends up looking like a peevish girl who is trying to insult a man that wants to dance with her.

Willoughby serves as wonderful counterpoint to Evelina in this scene. He performs all the necessary forms and deference to Evelina in seeking her hand for the dance, yet does so in a way that makes it clear that he is a rude and insolent man. Evelina writes to Villars,

The moment we had gone down the dance, I was hastening away from him, but he stopt me, and said that I could by no means return to my party, without giving offence, before we had done our duty of walking up the dance. As I know nothing at all of these rules and customs, I was obliged to submit to his directions; but I fancy I looked rather uneasy, for he took notice of my inattention, saying, in his free way, ""Whence that anxiety?—Why are those lovely eyes perpetually averted?"" (Burney, 44)

Willoughby here is leaning hard on the rules to keep Evelina within reach of himself. It is clear that Evelina no longer wishes to be near him yet he pursues her still, and does so by telling her that she would give offense if she were to leave him. It is interesting that Willoughby takes no ownership over the offense. His words are not that he would be offended or that it would hurt his feelings, but that she can't leave without giving offense. To whom? How? Why? These things don't matter, the rules aren't personal for Willoughby; they are simply a means for gaining his desires. He is requiring her to submit to an anonymous set of rules that she does not understand. This anonymity is the grand failure of etiquette. Whereas a person is supposed to demonstrate their better qualities through their understanding and application of the rules of society, Willoughby is highlighting his failings. Highlighting his pride, vanity, and selfishness. Etiquette does not require someone to be concerned for the feelings of others but rather in this instance allows Willoughby to insulate himself from Evelina's feelings by forcing her to follow the rules.

Lord Orville complicates this understanding of the failure of etiquette. He holds himself to all of the highest requirements of polite society and is still able to be a good and amiable person. He shows that the excellent performance of etiquette is not a signifier of a person with no redeeming qualities. There must be a distinction drawn between two types of people here: Those who are able to follow the forms and those who are actually polite. It is clear that Willoughby is able to follow the forms, yet he is not polite. Evelina desires to be polite and is good-natured, yet she has not been taught the forms by which she should act. Orville is the pinnacle of both. He is able to observe the correct ways of acting, and he is also truly polite. This is seen again in the dance scene. When Willoughby is trying to embarrass Evelina in front of him, Orville refuses to expose her as ridiculous. When Willoughby passes her hand to Orville in a way that should make her actions obvious, Orville plays dumb, 'You do me too much honour, Sir,' cried [Orville], (with an air of gallantry, pressing it to his lips before he let it go) 'however, I shall be happy to profit by it' (Burney, 47). And then later when Willoughby is away, Orville says to Evelina, Be not distressed, I beseech you; I shall ever think my name honoured by your making use of it (Burney, 48). Orville's good nature shows itself in his detachment from the rules of etiquette. While observing them most stridently himself, he does not look down on those who do not follow them. Instead, he is gracious when Evelina is in distress and is glad that his name has been of some use is helping her get out of her situation.

In Pride and Prejudice this same point is made clear. Etiquette is not an accurate identifier of quality within a person, yet here, instead of value being given to characters simply because of their good nature, value is given for those who think freely. The best example of this is Elizabeth. Almost all of her social interactions include some mode of bending the rules or decorum. In her interactions with Lady Catherine, she refuses to act the way that an inferior should act in regard to someone of superior rank. When she visits Rosings, Elizabeth answers most of Lady Catherine's questions openly but when asked for her age Elizabeth refuses at first to answer. She does eventually reveal that she is not yet one and twenty (Austen, 162). When they meet again at Longbourn, Elizabeth again refuses to give in to her demands. After Lady Catherine asks if she is resolved to marry Darcy, Elizabeth says, I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected to me (Austen, 338). Elizabeth is valued for her determination to secure her own happiness in a way that would maintain her individualism and this is one of the shining moments when she declares that desire.

On the opposite end of the etiquette spectrum in Pride and Prejudice is Mr. Collins. He is made all of obedience and following the rules of personal engagement. Collins is made all the more ridiculous by the fact that he alerts people to the fact that he is obeying the proper forms. When is ready to leave Longbourn and return home, he says to Mr. Bennet, Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend on it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this (Austen, 122). It is, of course very polite to send a letter of thanks to someone who has been kind to you, but it is very rare that you would tell someone that they should expect that letter to come soon. Collins is seen as ridiculous for this attention to manners, yet he is also seen as ridiculous in the way that he makes very important decisions to satisfy the wishes of other people. His third reason for marrying Elizabeth is that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness (Austen, 103). This particular advice, while serving as the third reason for his coming to Longbourn for a wife seems to be the most important and if not that, is definitely the catalyst. It was this advice that allowed Collins to obsequiously leave Rosings, and had not Lady Catherine sent him to go, he most definitely would not have left.",27.72,27.2,18.59,15.33,8489
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Inclusion of Friday in Robinson Crusoe: An Exertion of European Dominance,"Slavery has long been both the subject of writings and a topic of debate for hundreds of years; while the actual merits behind slavery have been hotly contested, the fact remains that slavery has proved itself to be an imperative historical topic that reaches a wide audience. The novel Robinson Crusoe, by Daniel Defoe, centers on a man who becomes stranded on an island, which becomes his own domain. Most of the novel takes place with Crusoe alone on the island, but his entire way of life is altered when the author introduces a cannibal into the novel, which Crusoe quickly brands as his slave. Based on various criticisms of the novel, it is widely debated whether the character of Robinson Crusoe (and, in effect, Daniel Defoe himself) supported the use of slavery. Throughout the novel, Crusoe treats his servant with respect, even admitting to the reader that he loves him, which showcases a rare admission of respect for a lower class. However, regardless of the treatment of his servants, Crusoe still employs the use of slaves, seemingly gaining pleasure from his supremacy over them. This, in turn, sheds light on the common European views at the time regarding colonialism: that many nations, including England, desired to forcefully colonize nations inhabited with natives in order to both spread their Christian morals and to gain more power through territorial acquisitions. The entrance of Crusoe's slave Friday into the novel shifts the novel from being about Crusoe's dominance over territory to being about his supremacy over a human, which also signifies the European desires to conquer uncharted lands and their natives.

In order to gain a full perspective on Crusoe's view of slavery, the reader must closely examine his actions prior to his time stranded on the island. At the beginning of the novel, when Crusoe is actually forced into slavery himself, he effectively conveys his feelings on being enslaved; he feels that he suddenly changes from a Merchant into a miserable slave, (Defoe 15) already providing the reader with his hatred of being a slave. It's fairly obvious that Crusoe wants to be in a position of power; it's a completely different ideology for Crusoe himself to become a slave, and he makes his frustration extremely clear to the reader. Later, Crusoe meets Xury, an African boy with who he escapes the clutches of slavery. However, when both Crusoe and Xury find themselves on a Portuguese ship, the captain of the ship offers to buy Xury from Crusoe. Crusoe struggles with the decision, due to the boy's aid to him while they were both trapped as slaves earlier.

Ultimately, Crusoe decides to sell his friend to the Portuguese man for personal gain: …he offer'd me also 60 pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury, which I was loathe to take, not that I was not willing to let the Captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor Boy's Liberty…he would give the Boy an Obligation to set him free in ten Years, if he turn'd Christian; upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the Captain have him (26). Here, Crusoe displays the real value that he places on slaves like Xury; though he has doubts about selling him, he eventually decides to sell the boy back into slavery, setting up a harsh and unforgiving future for the young boy. Crusoe justifies the sale by explaining that after ten years go by, the boy will be let free; ten years in slavery is an incredibly lengthy time period, and the boy surely must have agreed to the sale simply to please Crusoe. Additionally, the boy will be forced to convert to Christianity, which accurately depicts the European colonialist attitude at the time; the Europeans desire not only to enslave people but to also teach them the ways of the white man, essentially forcing their philosophies and beliefs on people who come from various backgrounds.

The literary critic Ian Watt superbly conveys why Crusoe sold Xury into slavery:

Crusoe treats his personal relationships in terms of their commodity value. The Moorish boy, Xury, for example, helps him to escape from slavery, and on another occasion offers to prove his devotion by sacrificing his own life. Crusoe very properly resolves 'to love him ever after,' and promises 'to make him a great man.' But when chance leads them to the Portuguese trader, and its captain offers Crusoe sixty pieces of eight – twice Judas' figure – he cannot resist the bargain and sells Xury into slavery…Remorse later supervenes, but only when the tasks of his island existence renew his need for a slave. (Watt 302)

Watt describes the aspect of Crusoe's personality that lies at the heart of who he actually is: Crusoe views everything as a commodity, even people. His needs and wants are based on his ever-changing atmospheres; as Watt illustrates, Crusoe only shows guilt for selling Xury when he needs a slave on the island. Crusoe jumps at the chance to claim anything, and Xury is no exception; when Crusoe is offered money for his dear friend, he frets over the offer but ultimately accepts due to his want of material goods. In Crusoe's eyes, money outweighs the value of the life of Xury, so he sells him to a Portuguese trader he doesn't even know. Who knows what kind of experiences Xury will have to endure with the Portuguese? Furthermore, the Portuguese trader could easily renege on his deal and hold Xury captive for the rest of his life. In short, Crusoe pushes Xury into a life of uncertainty for extra money which he doesn't even need, simultaneously signifying his seemingly authoritarian dominance over slaves and his willingness to view people as commodities, meant to be traded or sold.

It's clear throughout the novel that Crusoe badly desires his own slaves on the island that he lands on. He writes, Besides, I fancied myself to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt (145). Crusoe realizes that he needs manual labor to help him survive on the island, but more importantly, he desires his own slaves precisely because he wants to be in control. He has proclaimed the island to be his own; he repeatedly refers to places on the island as his, showcasing his inherently possessive nature. Later, when he discovers Friday, he details his encounter: …first I made him know his Name should be Friday…I likewise taught him to say Master  (149). The mere fact that Crusoe brands his new acquaintance with his own name for him portrays the sense of superiority that Crusoe has over other races; he doesn't bother to inquire as to what the native's name is, but, like a teacher, instructs Friday to follow his decisions.

Not only does Crusoe enforce his own sense of control over Friday, but he actually tells himself that Friday enjoys it: Friday is perfectly oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections were ty'd to me, like those of a Child to a Father… (151). Friday undoubtedly is gracious for Crusoe's saving of his life, but his affection for Crusoe isn't like those of a Child to a Father at all; later in the novel, when Friday and Crusoe come across the father of Friday, Friday embraces him with more emotion than he ever shows Crusoe. Crusoe simply assumes that Friday is a willing servant because of Crusoe's act of saving him from death, when the deed was performed so that Crusoe could obtain a servant. Various examples of Crusoe's tone suggest that Crusoe thinks of Friday as a savage, of sorts. He calls Friday a poor Savage on multiple occasions (159, 172), truly revealing to the reader that he still has bigoted feelings towards his own servant. By branding Friday as a savage that he attempts to control, it's easier for Crusoe to turn him into his servant; he forces Friday to be his slave while justifying it by teaching him the ways of the Bible and Christian ethics. Essentially, Crusoe still feels some sense of ownership over Friday, a sense that revisits his personality on various occasions.

Crusoe describes his island as solely his: My island was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd...My people were perfectly subjected: I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver… (174). Here, Crusoe finally merges his notions of his own control over the island and his power over the people on his island, or rather, his subjects. He is Lord, and no one can strip him of the title, at least until he leaves the island. The presence of Friday (and, to an extent, the other cannibals) illustrates the state of mind of Crusoe during his tenure on the island; he takes his previous view of slaves as a commodity and applies it to his own dictatorship, forcing Friday to be his slave while justifying the slavery by saving Friday's life. He distinctly exerts his power and control over his island to expand over the island's inhabitants as well, portraying his true beliefs about slavery. Much like his description of the island (he writes of  My cave on page 194), Friday is now his, bound by the constraints of both the circumstances in which he was obtained and by the governing rules that Crusoe has produced.

The dominance of Crusoe over Friday also comes to represent the feelings that Europeans had at the time regarding slavery of other races. As James Joyce explains, The true symbol of the British conquest is Robinson Crusoe…he is the true prototype of the British colonist, as Friday…is the symbol of the subject races (323). Crusoe proves himself to be a Jack of All Trades type of character, adapting into most situations with ease and comfort; Friday is made out to be hopeless and lost. Crusoe saves him from danger, enslaves him and teaches him the Bible, which epitomizes the European colonialist action all around the world around the time in which the novel was written. The novel doesn't explicitly condone slavery, but it makes it seem that without it, society couldn't function properly. Additionally, if Friday is a symbol of the subject races, as Joyce proposes, his character probably serves to portray the savages, or rather, all the non-European races, as needing to be taught Christian ways.

The issue of slavery in Robinson Crusoe can be interpreted in a variety of ways; Crusoe repeatedly desires to own his own slaves, and when he acquires them, he treats them with a level of respect. However, this respect constitutes of a feeling that other races are in need, and that they need to be enslaved for the good of both the Europeans and the non-Europeans. Crusoe is hesitant in treating his slaves badly, and he even confesses to loving one of them, but his opinion is clear: that without slavery, society cannot function in an efficient manner. By including the character of Friday in the novel, Defoe makes it possible for Crusoe not only to exert his power over territory but also enables him to assert his dominance over the other races that he encounters. Crusoe's possessiveness is never more prevalent; he yearns for power and grabs hold of it through his island and through his enslavement of Friday.",48.37,24.37,0,2.99,11168
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Law of Love,"In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus redefines the family as whoever does the will of God the father, and his life and teaching throughout the gospel is presented as a gradual revelation of what that will is (Mk3:35). He shares with the religious authorities of the time the belief that this will is revealed in the commandments—that is, in torah. But he strongly contends with them on the authority of other traditions, especially concerning offerings and kosher rites. In line with the prophets, he argues that love towards God and others is the true meaning of torah, and God's true will as law-giver. Thus, one fulfills torah—and so the will of God—not by adhering to rituals (seen in this teaching as human traditions), but by fostering social justice out of love.

It is, therefore, a matter of interpretation: Jesus differs from the authorities of the time in his belief about the tradition of the elders and its conformance with the will of God—which can only be a matter of interpretation for man. What is valuable then is simply coming to an understanding of his teaching, which his followers felt so strongly about as to break away from this tradition of the elders whom they so surely loved.

Above all, he teaches a worship of God which is in and of the heart. This teaching is in line with such ideas as the circumcision of the heart in Deuteronomy1 and the prophets, and even with some of the Psalms2. In this, Christianity continues a movement already unfolding in Judaism3 towards a new idea of worship—and thus, of the community of worshipers—based on new ideas of purity and impurity. It teaches that all these things are in the human heart, and not in the body of tradition.

To understand what this worship of the heart is, and what it means for the common identity, one need look further on into the Gospel of Mark, to chapter seven, where these ideas are laid out in the form of a story. During a dispute with some scribes and Pharisees, Jesus makes a distinction between what he sees as human tradition—here the kosher laws, laws of ritual purity and impurity—and the true will of God as revealed in his commandments:

Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them […] So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, ""Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?"" He said to them, ""Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written, ""'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.'You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.""(Mk7: 1-2, 5-8)

This view of some rituals is by no means new to Judaism; rather, Jesus' conflict with the authorities here picks up and echoes past conflicts between prophet and priest. Jesus himself openly shows the continuity between his teaching and the teaching of the prophets when he quotes Isaiah. Indeed, the Jesus movement seems a further unfolding of that begun by the prophets, a movement away from ritual and toward social justice as the means of fulfilling torah. As with the prophets, it is not an attack against the law itself; rather, it presents a refutation, from within Judaism, of a particular way of living torah which was around, and which Jesus and the fellow Jews who followed him saw and disagreed with. That is, fulfillment of the commandments out of a sense of legal obligation only, not out of any understanding of the morality contained within them. The scribes and the Pharisees then become the set type for this kind of legalistic worship, the negative way in which the Jewish authorities are presented in this story.

The example he puts forth is of authorities who insist upon making offerings to God instead of using the goods to support one's parents in their old age:

Then he said to them, ""You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.' But you say that if anyone tells father or mother, 'Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban' (that is, an offering to God)—then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother, thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on."" (Mk7: 9-13)

In this view, the commandments concerning right behavior towards one's fellow human beings are more important than those which govern ritual observance, and the two are even at odds sometimes. And in times like this, when carrying out the ritual commandments keeps one from carrying out the social and moral commandments, the latter override the former. It even seems that—by continually calling certain features of worship, such as kosher laws and laws of offering, human traditions/precepts, and setting them in opposition to the word/commandment of God—Jesus is arguing that such ritual laws are not from God at all, but are human inventions or misunderstandings. If this is the case, even in this he is not without precedent in Judaism4.

But it is not a denouncement or an abolition of the law; far from it. Rather, his charge is against [abandoning] the commandment of God, and [holding] to human tradition, and making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on (Mk7: 8, 13). He appeals to Moses (i.e. Torah) as a teaching come from God and not man, and thus authoritative above all other traditions. So it is at once an affirmation of the law as the will of God, and a warning not to give a human interpretation to the commandments such that they no longer bring forth the social justice which Jesus, in line with the prophets, teaches as the true will of God and the true meaning of his commandments.

In this teaching, he urges all to look beyond simply the physical behavior towards others that the law commands, and to see what this reveals about how one is to look at others in the heart. Jesus, calling upon a voice from the past, urges those listening to shift the focus of their worship from ritual to moral; he appeals to the commandments on the basis of their morality, not simply their legality. In quoting the passage from Isaiah, Jesus sets in opposition to worship that is only with the lips the concept of a worship with the heart: This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me (Mk7:6). What is being condemned is an outer worship which does not proceed from an inner—something like going through the motions, perhaps. Such worship is condemned as empty, in vain, coming only from what is human and leading only to what is human, ungodly altogether (Mk7:7).

All this leads up to one of the most profound messages in all the Christian writings, where Jesus lays out his own ideas about the heart as the place where torah is fulfilled, and purity achieved:

Then he called the crowd again and said to them, ""Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile."" When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, ""Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile, since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?"" (Thus he declared all foods clean.) And he said, ""It is what comes out of a person that defiles. For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder, adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."" (Mk7:14-23)

The immediate emphasis is on listening and understanding; the will to know, and the knowing itself. Answering the authorities' concern about his disciples' defiled hands, Jesus calls the crowd to come to a new understanding of purity and impurity as being not from the body, but from the heart. For the distinction here between heart and stomach seems not to be between the two as organs both of the body, but between the body and something else. That is to say, it seems that what is meant by the heart is not the heart in the chest. Rather, it seems the heart that is meant is the seat of the will, and the place of conscience (inner knowledge, or understanding.) For what is in the heart are intentions; and, consistent with Christian teaching elsewhere, it is not only physical acts of evil which defile a person, but even the willing thought in the heart5. The act is what comes forth from this thought in the heart; fornication, slander, etc. These are not just abstract thoughts, but real words and deeds which come from the will and the knowledge within. And these things alone, which are in and of the heart, make one pure or impure. So, he argues, it cannot be the purity of the body that makes pure the heart; for purity of heart is what makes the body pure. And this is what's essential; for it is from a right heart, knowing and willing what is good, that right behavior will come.

So at the same time as he is breaking down long-standing ideas of how one is to walk in the way of God, he is making new ones which are in a way more demanding, in that they urge one to keep God's commandments not out of a sense of legal obligation, but out of a deeply personal understanding of the morality which they hold. Jesus urges his followers to come to an understanding in their own lives of what God wills through the commandments, and then wittingly and willingly live them. And his own understanding, as far as it is presented in this text, is that what God wills above all in the commandments is love; love towards him and towards one another6. Love here is not just a feeling, but a good word and deed, born from the will and the knowledge within, in the heart. This is the profound message of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, carrying on the message of the prophets of old: one worships God primarily by loving others, in words and deeds which are from the heart; this is the sum of all the law and the prophets.

So Jesus continues to break traditional bonds, and make new ones. Just as before he redefined the family as those who do the will of God the father, so now, in shifting the focus of the faith inward, to the human heart, he redefines the community of faith itself. He does this not by removing torah, or rendering it obsolete, but by reinterpreting the way in which it is to be fulfilled. For he says that all one needs to fulfill the law is contained within the human person; in the will and understanding of the good, which is brought to fruition in the love of others. Thus he opens the way for Gentiles also to become the children of God and the heirs of his promise to Abraham. For in this view, these things do not come by keeping the traditions of the elders—not by circumcision or offerings or rituals to purify—but by keeping the law of love in the heart. The ones who worship God in this way will be members of the community, regardless of aught else.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Less is More: Courtship in Twelfth Night,"A play with a plot based on various complications surrounding love—in particular unrequited love—Twelfth Night has no shortage of courtship. Indeed, the play is essentially a series of courtships concluding in several marriages at the play's end. Although, courtship is generally considered the preferred means in obtaining one's love object, in Twelfth Night, courtship has an alternate role. Contrary to what one may expect, those characters who court their objects of affection and take steps to deliberately woo them are the least successful in winning their affection, often times completely failing to win the affections of their love and even ending up alone. Alternatively, those characters who cannot court or do not court their objects of love seem to be far more successful in obtaining love or marriage than those who do. This is an idea that is demonstrated in the play's main romantic plot: the love triangle between Duke Orsino, Olivia, and Cesario/Viola. In Twelfth Night, through a series of failed courtships, Shakespeare takes a skeptical stance on courtship, demonstrating that courtship can be a superficial expression of love and that it is not necessarily conducive to love.

Through Duke Orsino's failed courtship with Lady Olivia, Shakespeare reinforces the superficiality of courtship present in several of the courtships throughout the play. The play opens with Orsino declaring, If music be the food of love, play on,/ Give me excess of it that, surfeiting,/ The appetite may sicken and so die (I.i. 1-15). In this moment, Orsino portrays love as something that he desires and craves, but this craving is one that leaves him insatiable at times. Because of this, he would like to have love to the point where he no longer desires it. This is an idea that resonates throughout the play and Orsino's character, as he is constantly seeking love, primarily from Lady Olivia. Orsino is adamant in his courtship with Olivia and continues to seek out her affection and make exclamatory statements about his love for her, despite her unwavering rejection. However, as the play progresses, it seems that Orsino is more concerned with merely being in love rather than being in love with Olivia specifically. Indeed, in his courtship with Olivia, he never actually does any of the courting himself, but sends out Valentine and Cesario to court Olivia for him while he complains at home. And at the end of the play, Orsino's love proves fickle as his love for Olivia is quickly abandoned, and he selects Viola for a wife instead. Ultimately, Shakespeare demonstrates that Orsino's declarations of love are superficial and his courtship of Olivia is a selfish endeavor. Thus, through Orsino's courtship with Olivia, Shakespeare reinforces the idea that courtship does not translate into genuine love and can merely be a slew of empty words, as there is a distinct difference between what one says in courtship and what one actually does and feels.

Similarly, Shakespeare provides the readers with another example of questionable courtship in the character of Olivia. Despite her passion and declarations of love, Olivia's courtship of Cesario is almost equally superficial and self-indulgent. Like Orsino, Olivia is determined and almost desperate in her courting of Cesario, offering him monetary rewards and fabricating stories, for example, that he has left a ring, to lure him back to her home. However, regardless of how strong Olivia's feelings are, the fact remains that she and her waxen heart have fallen in love with an illusion. Indeed, Cesario does not actually exist in reality; he is a character. In this sense, similar to the way Orsino is in love with love itself, it seems Olivia is more in love with the idea of Cesario than Cesario himself. Like Orsino, Olivia also yearns for her object of affection, one who has adamantly refused her and one she cannot have. However, similar to Orsino, Olivia's courtship of Cesario and declarations of love are not really about Cesario and her love for him, but are melodramatic self-indulgences. Emotionally fickle, Olivia quickly abandons her vow to mourn her brother for seven years' heat and immerses herself in a state of lovesickness for Cesario (I.i.25). And ultimately, at the play's close, Olivia's love is quickly transferred from Cesario to Sebastian. Again, in the character of Olivia, Shakespeare demonstrates the self-indulgent nature of those characters that aggressively court and declare their love to others. As the play progresses, the affections of both Olivia and Orsino seem more like dramatized declarations rather than genuine statements of love. In the world Shakespeare creates in Twelfth Night, the harder one tries, the more insincere and suspect one's motivations appear (and are). Thus, Shakespeare portrays courtship negatively in this sense.

Additionally, in Twelfth Night, there is an element of self pre-occupation and a sense of being out of touch with reality in the characters that take deliberate steps to woo their love interests. For example, Orsino's delusions regarding love are brought to the forefront in the conversation he has with Cesario about the differences between a man's love and a woman's love. He says, …No woman's sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion/ As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart/ So big, to hold so much. They lack retention./ Alas their love may be called appetite,/ No motion of the liver, but the palate… (II.iv. 92-97). In this moment, Orsino declares that a woman cannot love with the same passion that a man can. Ironically, in the end, Viola, a woman, has a love for Orsino that is the only instance of genuine, unwavering love throughout the play. Additionally, of the characters in the play, Orsino is the character that lacks the most retention, because although he is undoubtedly determined, he easily disregards Olivia for Viola in the end. Although Olivia eventually marries Sebastian, at least she does so under the guise that it is Cesario. Additionally, Orsino's additional instruction to Cesario to make no compare/ Between that love a woman can bear me/ And that I owe Olivia reveals his selfishness (100-103). Orsino is so deluded in the splendor of his own love, he has become out of touch with reality. This is a selfishness and delusion that is also seen in Olivia (who has fallen in love with woman disguised as a man) and within the subplot in the characters of Malvolio and Sir Andrew (who both genuinely believe they have a legitimate chance of marrying Olivia and sharing her status). By calling into question the character and rationality of those who court and make deliberate attempts to woo their love interests, Shakespeare further critiques courtship and its role in genuine love.

Alternatively, Shakespeare gives the one character who literally cannot court the one she loves, the most genuine love in the play. Despite the fact that she cannot convey her love of Orsino explicitly through courtship as a result of her circumstances, Viola's love seems to be the truest of the characters in the play. The difference between Viola's love and the other character's in the play becomes especially apparent in Viola's counterargument to Orsino's assertion that women cannot love as passionately as men. She says,

My father had a daughter loved a man…She never told her love,/ But let concealment, like a worm I'th' bud,/ Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,/ And with a green and yellow melancholy/ She sat like patience on a monument,/ Smiling as grief. Was not this love indeed? (107, 110-115).

In this moment of near confession, Viola is undoubtedly referring to her own struggles as she deals with unrequited love, a problem both Orsino and Olivia have. However, the private nature of Viola's love is a notable difference. Viola's love exists whether or not it is explicitly expressed through courtship. It is genuine and is not more or less true based on who knows it. This cannot necessarily be said of the love of Orsino and Olivia, as its declaration seems to be one of the few ways in which their love can be thought to actually exist. Indeed, Viola's love does not need to be proclaimed in melodramatic statements or grand gestures. Additionally, Viola is not in love with the idea of being in love as Orsino is or in love with a near fictional character as Olivia is. This characteristic of Viola's love makes it genuine and real in a way that the other characters' love is not. In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare also seems to suggest that courtship somehow cheapens or bastardizes love. In giving the character who does not and is not able to deliberately woo her object of affection, Shakespeare further demonstrates that not only is courtship not necessarily a good indication of real love, courtship is also not necessary to have genuine love for someone.

Ultimately, in the play's conclusion, Shakespeare's critique of courtship comes to a head, as each of the various courtships in the novel fail, while other characters, who took part in little to no wooing, find love. Olivia, under the impression that she is marrying Cesario, marries Viola's twin brother Sebastian, who merely accepts Olivia's proposal and gives himself up to love, rather than making any insincere declarations of love to her. Similarly, Orsino does not end up with Olivia as he desires, but rather Viola (formerly Cesario). Thus, Viola, whose love has been genuine throughout the play and who took no part in any courtship, is paired with her object of affection. Additionally, despite ending up with two completely different people than the ones they spent the entire play courting, Olivia and Orsino are perfectly content with their new spouses. This is the ultimate demonstration of the fickle nature of their courtship and love. At one point in the play, Viola (as Cesario) says, We men may say more, swear more, but indeed/ Our shows are more than will; for still we prove/ Much in our vows, but little in our love (II. iv.116-118). Although, Viola says this in a discussion about the difference between men and women, this quote can also be considered a commentary on courtship in general. Throughout the play, Shakespeare demonstrates how those who court their objects of affection say more, swear more, but prove much in [their] vows, and little in [their] love.

In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare's attitude toward courtship is decidedly skeptical. Through a series of botched courtships, Shakespeare provides a critique of courtship, in which he questions the potentially superficial nature of courtship and the sincerity, character, and rationality of those who take deliberate steps to woo others. As the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the characters who do take part in courtships are self-motivated and their love is less than genuine. In the end, those characters are not entirely successful in their courtships. Conversely, those who do not court and deliberately woo others seem to fare better. In particular, through the character of Viola, Shakespeare seems to suggest that true love does not need to rely on courtship. Ultimately, in Twelfth Night, Shakespeare demonstrates that courtship is not an adequate measure of genuine love and is not a necessity in obtaining love and/or marriage.",0,0,0,0,11317
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"Andrew Marvell's ""The Definition of Love""","Love has been the topic of literature for centuries. Although experienced by many, love is intangible, difficult to adequately capture in writing, and difficult to define. In his poem The Definition of Love, Andrew Marvell uses a number of abstractions, capitalized for emphasis, in an attempt to define the ultimate abstraction: Love. Born out of Despair, the Love in this poem is characterized by an element of Impossibility and very little Hope, and is ultimately prohibited from its complete culmination by the highly personified abstraction of Fate. In addition to the poem's abstractions, there are geographic and mathematical references, and love is described in terms of mathematical probabilities and impossibilities. Thus, as The Definition of Love continues, the abstract is intermixed with the concrete. Through these oppositional descriptions, Marvell is able to capture the paradoxical nature of love. At the poem's end, both the abstract and the concrete, and the author and his love, cannot be reconciled or joined. Ultimately what emerges is the sense that all real love (that is, existing in reality and permitted by Fate) is flawed, and that the union of a perfect love is an impossibility to achieve.

Throughout The Definition of Love, there is an element of impossibility surrounding the love in the poem, and impossibility plays a large role in Marvell's definition of love. Interestingly, despite the fact that the poem is called The Definition of Love, a title that suggests the poem attempts to propose a definitive, all-encompassing description of love—another task that seems relatively impossible—the narrator of the poem introduces the love in the poem as  my love. As the poem continues, it becomes apparent that this case is perhaps indicative of love in general in some respects. Regardless, the overarching characteristic of the love in this poem is its impossibility, an idea that is introduced in the poem's opening. From the outset, Marvell describes the Impossibility of this Love in terms of abstractions. Marvell writes, My love is of a birth as rare/ As ‘tis, for object, strange and high;/ It was begotten by Despair/ Upon Impossibility  (Lines 1-4). Thus, in Marvell's love, Despair, the complete loss or absence of hope, gives rise to Love, despite that love being seemingly unfeasible. Additionally, Marvell goes on to explain that only Magnanimous Despair alone could show me so divine a thing. Where Feeble Hope could ne'er have flown/ But vainly flapped its tinsel wing (4-8). This moment further reiterates the Love's impossibility; it is almost completely void of Hope, a hope in this circumstance that is likened to a bird attempting to fly, but remaining land-ridden. Thus, according to Marvell, it appears that in this Love and perhaps in love generally, Love is doomed from the outset and any attempts to overcome this impossibility are futile. This love seems impossible upon its inception and its impossibility only grows as the poem progresses.

The primary reason that the Love in this poem is so plagued by impossibility is the domineering presence of Fate, who refuses to let the two loves unite. Marvell personifies Fate to a great extent throughout the poem and quite negatively, as s/he/it is described as jealous and tyrannical, among other things (Lines 13, 16). Marvell writes, For Fate with jealous eyes does see/ Two perfect loves, nor lets them close; Their union would her ruin be,/ and her tyrannic power depose (Stanza 4, Lines 13-16). Marvell suggests that Fate has a vested interest in preventing this union of love, particular because it is between two perfect loves (14). It becomes clear why exactly the union of the Love in the poem is so impossible: indeed, it the perfect nature of the love in question. As the footnote to the text explains, Two perfections, united, would not be subject to change and thereby to fate (2.). Thus, it appears the love, subject to fate as (or if) all things are, is entirely out of one's own control. Furthermore, the perfect nature of the love, however beneficial perfection is, is also hindered by its perfection, as Fate prevents a perfect love from being completely actualized. Thus, Marvell not only seems to suggest that there is an impossibility associated with love, but that the closer to perfection a love is, the less likely it is to be actualized because of Fate's jealousy. Indeed, perfect love cannot fully exist in reality. Thus, Marvell's definition proposes that love is not (and cannot be) perfect, but rather, imperfect.

The idea of the impossibility of perfect love is further reiterated in Marvell's use of mathematical concepts, a stark contrast to much of the poem's abstract language. In particular, the metaphor of mathematical lines is especially revealing. Marvell writes, As lines, so loves oblique may well/ Themselves in every angle greet,/ But ours, so truly parallel,/ Though infinite, can never meet (25-28). Oblique lines, being at a slant, are neither parallel lines nor right angles. As a result, they are able to touch. Parallel lines, on the other hand, never touch. Despite being side by side and a consistent distance apart, if permitted to continue on forever, two parallel lines would never intersect. In this stanza, Marvell likens the perfect love he has with his object of affection to a relationship between parallel lines; although they are corresponding (able to be matched, joined, or interlocked) and even if their love is infinite, they are never united because of the perfect nature of their relationship (dictionary source). Conversely, the relationship between oblique lines is similar to that of a less perfect love. Far from being truly parallel, two lines (or lovers) that are oblique are able to eventually meet within every angle (or unite at some point in time). However, the two lovers represented by the oblique lines are not perfect, but in this imperfection, they are united. Thus, Marvell differentiates between perfect and imperfect love and illustrates the predicament of perfect love through the use of a metaphor utilizing concrete mathematical concepts.

Ultimately, the poem's close suggests that this perfect love will not end in the union of lover and loved. Indeed, the poem closes concludes with a contrary idea. In the last stanza, Marvell writes, Therefore the Love which us doth blind,/ But fate so enviously debars,/ Is the conjunction of the mind,/ And opposition of the stars (29-32). In the end, it seems Fate, with her decrees of steal, is the force that definitively determines the outcome of the love in question (17). Because Fate enviously debars the love, and fate is completely out of one's control, then it seems the conjunction Marvell refers to will not occur. Interestingly, Marvell describes the love as the conjunction of the mind,/ and the opposition of the stars (31-32). In these two lines, Marvell appears to be referring to the coming together of the mind, which is based on rational thought, with the stars, which have a heavenly, other world connotation. This could also be thought of as representing the conjunction of the concrete and the abstract. However, if so, the phrase is somewhat paradoxical, as the conjunction involves opposition. If anything, it also seems rather impossible, as it also suggests the combining of two polarities. Similarly, just as the mind and the stars cannot be conjoined, the narrator and his would be lover cannot be united either, just as the set of parallel lines cannot intersect. This last stanza allows Marvell to further reiterates the idea that perfect love is an impossibility and its union cannot be completely attained.

In The Definition of Love, Andrew Marvell sets forth a definition of love that is far from perfect. Indeed, throughout the poem, he demonstrates the impossibility of uniting two perfect loves. In doing so, he suggests that a perfect love can never exist in its entirety and in reality because Fate will not let it conjoin. In other words, what Marvell proposes is that perfect love does not actually exist. Like a pair of parallel lines or two polarities, some things simply cannot be conjoined. Perfect love is one of these instances. Indeed, Love is paradoxical and inexplicable at times. Furthermore, it is difficult to define, whether in scientific terms or solely in abstractions. Ultimately, the definition of love Marvell sets forth is based almost entirely on what love is not: perfect.",0,0,0,0,8473
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"We Will Both Praise it Now: A discussion on History, Memory, and the voices who sing of both","""Personal interpretations of past time—the stories that people tell themselves in order to explain how they got to the place they currently inhabit—are often in deep and ambiguous conflict with the official interpretative devices of a culture. Carolyn Kay Steedman, Landscape for a Good Woman

It has been said that history is written by the winners. Indeed, as Walter Benjamin says, Whoever has emerged victorious participates to this day in the triumphal procession in which present rulers step over those who are lying prostrate (Illuminations, 256). But what of the memories of those who lived through the historical events? Before the appearance, or more specifically the study of, postcolonial literature, the stories of indigenous peoples were told by the conquerors and explorers: D.H. Lawrence, Leonard Woolf, and Daniel Defoe. It could perhaps then be inferred that history is a Western theory or recalling the past, while memory is a non-Western method of remembering the past. The emergence of memory as a category of academic discourse is then a healthy result of decolonization (Klein 135). Indeed, the declaration of history and memory as not being polar opposites has become one of the clichés of the school of thought. Memory is replacing old stand-bys such as nature, culture, and language, as the term most usually coupled with history and that shift is remaking historical imagination (Klein 128). History, as with other key terms, finds its meaning largely through its counter concepts like the future as well as its synonyms the past and thus the emergence of memory seeks to redefine the boundaries of histories. Here, two authors who have broken the boundaries between history and memory in postcolonial literature will be discussed: Derek Walcott’s Omeros and J.M Coetzee’s Waiting for the Barbarians. Walcott and Coetzee depict very different places in very different ways; Walcott describes the mythical history of St. Lucia through multiple voices and experiences, while Coetzee describes the confessional memoir of a single man in an abstract place. Yet both authors aim to do the same thing: to insert their characters’ memories into broader historical contexts, while at the same time allowing their characters to forget pieces of the past.

Walcott’s Omeros has been discussed as the juxtaposition between history and myth of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. To do so is to aptly represent a colonized, decolonized, and postcolonized nation whose history is amalgamation of colonial histography and cultural memory. Instead of privileging one over the other, Walcott rather utilizes both historical and mythical modes of representation precisely in order to foreground the way in which one discourse relies upon and cancels out the other (Williams 277). Walcott abstracts the Caribbean island into mythical proportions by creating a labyrinth of memories, histories, and identities. He translates the single landscape of St. Lucia by repeatedly redefining through different people’s perspectives. Walcott seeks to step analytically sideways, to see the landscape of St. Lucia (literally and metaphorically) from a different angle, to see the life events of Helen, Achilles, Hector, and Plunkett not as trivial or isolated, but significant and necessary to History. At the same time he resists being a part of History. Walcott does not feature a central protagonist, but rather allows the maintenance of a wider interpretation through a chorus of different voices, albeit different experiences. He must negotiate the memories and histories of his characters as well as national identities such as British (the Empire), Greek (the literary tradition), and Aruac (the native culture): where Ogun can fire one with his partner Zeus (Walcott 53). In short, the multiplicity of Omeros is a hybridist cultural exercise.

On the other hand, J.M.Coetzee’s Waiting for the Barbarians employs a single voice to tell the allegorical history of an abstract frontier. By setting his novel in an unnamed country at an unnamed time, by terming the two parties the Empire and the Barbarians…Coetzee creates an allegorical landscape that loosely suggests the Roman Empire on the verge of collapse but undoubtedly points to South Africa today (Gallagher 281). Unlike Walcott, Coetzee indexes a theoretical geography and gives it a single voice. The Magistrate tells the story of the frontier, wherever it may be. By creating a nationalist allegory, Coetzee also creates a universal Empire, or at least an Empire that has existed before, all over the globe. Moreover, Coetzee credits this universal Empire for dictating the way in which history is created. As the Magistrate declares: Empire has created the time of history. Empire has located its existence not in the smooth recurrent spinning time of the cycle of the seasons but in the jagged time of rise and fall, of beginning and end, of catastrophe (Coetzee 133). Though the catastrophe the Magistrate speaks of may be a natural disaster or war, it is evident to readers of Coetzee that he is speaking of the torture and oppression of South Africa, without calling it such. The effect of this time displacement is to reveal truths about any oppressive society… (Gallagher 281-282).

Yet by saying so in allegorical terms, he speaks not only to South Africa’s regime, but to any like it.

Just as Coetzee aims to display the truth about the world in which he lives, so too does the Magistrate of his novel. He wishes to leave behind an archive of what has happened on his frontier; the torture, the barbarism, albeit the madness of the Empire. Yet, any time he wishes to speak, write, or know the truth, he is at a loss for words. What the second document is to be I do not yet know. A testament? A memoir? A confession? A history of thirty years on the frontier? (Coetzee 58). The inability to decide which kind of archive to leave says much about the Magistrate’s ambivalence towards his experience. By wanting to leave a testament he professes his belief about what happened; a memoir would be an account of his personal experience; a confession would admit crimes or wrongdoing; a history would be a record of past events. The Magistrate’s memory then, is perhaps all of these modes of remembering, which leads him to be indecisive. Yet what he does know is this: I will not disappear into the earth without leaving my mark on them (Coetzee 112). However, to correctly relay the events that have transpired on the frontier, the Magistrate feels he cannot be bounded by law, order, or Empire. …I will abandon the locutions of a civil servant with literary ambitions and begin to tell the truth (Coetzee 154). Nonetheless, memory and history take place in relation to broader social contexts, thus they are always bounded. The Magistrate is bounded by the Empire, whose agenda does not necessarily include the truth about happened, what people remember, but how it serves the Empire’s interests. Indeed, Colonel Joll (the quintessential representation of the cold, distant Empire with his sunglasses and lack of compassion) very explicitly tells the Magistrate that his memory and the history of his frontier are of little importance: You want to go down in history as a martyr, I suspect. But who is going to put you in the history books? These border troubles are of no significance…People are not interested in the history of the back of beyond (Coetzee 114). Despite his seeming lack of agency as his aims of recalling his memories of the frontier and making a history or them, do not serve the Empire’s greater interests, the Magistrate wishes to leave his mark in the history book as being the only man who was not a barbarian (Coetzee 104).

Another man who wishes to leave his mark on the history books is Walcott’s Colonel Plunkett in Omeros. Plunkett obsessively researches the history of the Caribbean island, through its naval archives: History was fact/History was a cannon, not a lizard (Walcott 92). Yet as he delves further into St. Lucia’s history, he realizes two things: firstly, that he is looking for his memory in the archives. While Plunkett’s textual identity is governed by and constitutive of a discourse of British imperialism, however, he is nonetheless compelled to construct a familial genealogy in a mode of discourse more mythical than historical (Williams 278). Though he has no association but a name, Plunkett immediately inserts his name into the histories; he calls this sailor his son, as if Plunkett wants his lineage, his memory, to live on through history.

Secondly, Plunkett wishes to not only include himself into history, but also Helen, his housemaid, the embodiment of the beautiful island: So Plunkett decided that what the place needed/was its true place in history, that he’d spend hours/for Helen’s sake on research, so he proceeded/to the whir of enormous moths in the still house/Memory’s engines (Walcott 64). Plunkett’s desire to give Helen a history, because he believes she does not have one of her own, without access to History and its archives, echoes Edward Said in his Orientalism where he says, If he does not speak directly for the Orientals, it is because they after all speak another language, yet he knows how they feel since he knows their history, their reliance upon such as he, and their expectations (Said 34). Plunkett wishes to take over, albeit colonizes Helen’s history because he believes it is he who can properly and objectively represent her. She cannot do it herself, as she has no agency, nor a voice.

Plunkett is not the only one trying to define and write Helen. Walcott’s Homeresque poet-narrator looks to do the same: Plunkett, in his innocence/had tried to change History to a metaphor/in the name of a housemaid; I, in self-defence/altered her opposite. Yet it was all for her (Walcott 270). Walcott’s poet looks to do what Plunkett does, but more prosaically. He writes history from the bottom up, trying to give a voice to silenced people like Achilles, Hector, and Helen, individuals written of and about by those other than themselves. He attempts to tell of moments when the dominate history and one’s own experience do not match up: the prose/of abrupt fishermen cursing over canoes (Walcott 15). Yet by doing so, the poet-narrator (and in turn, Walcott) believes he is only perpetuating the myth of history: What I had read and rewritten till literature/was as guilty as History (Walcott 271). By inserting these everyday people and their experiences into the epic, Walcott creates a discord, but in doing so makes them legitimate for the epic genre, and renders them fit for the grandiose, for History. Perhaps then, there was no real need for the historian’s/remorse, nor for literature’s (Walcott 271).

In the creation of history, through the memories of a single man, or a multitude of island denizens, there is also the creation of forgetting. Whether intentional or unintentional, to recall, write, or sing the past is also to forget some of it. For Coetzee’s Magistrate, the forgetting is a very intentional act. He wants to forget the Empire, the frontier, the Barbarians, as a means to erase the anguish of what he has seen and experienced. It would be better if this chapter in history of the world were terminated at once…and we swore to make a new start, to run an empire in which there would be no more injustice, no more pain (Coetzee 24). The Magistrate’s intentional forgetting is due to the guilt he feels for letting torture and hunting of the barbarians happen. His guilt, and his forgetting of his guilt, manifest in the Magistrate’s relationship with the barbarian girl. After being tortured by the soldiers of the Empire, she is blind and crippled; the Magistrate forms an intimate relationship with her, perhaps to alleviate his guilt. So I begin to face the truth of what I am trying to do: to obliterate the girl. I realize that if I took a pencil to sketch her face I would not know where to start. Is she truly so featureless? (Coetzee 47). It is not that the girl is featureless so much as it is that the Magistrate wants her to be so. He wants to first understand her scarred body, and then erase it; her marked body will not allow him to forget, thus he wishes to erase her body. Throughout the novel, when the Magistrate searches for meaning, he confronts blankness (Gallagher 279). So it is with the barbarian girl, and his desire to obliterate her and the history on her body.

For those inhabiting Walcott’s Omeros, the forgetting is less a deliberate deed and more a consequence of a colonial history that writes and rewrites the island’s experience. We think of the past/as better forgotten than fixed with stony regret (Walcott 192). To remember is to regret; to forget is to let go. In a text where multiple traditions and characters overlap, it seems only natural that certain moments, names, places, and people are forgotten, and there is little that can be done about it. This was history. I had no power to change it (Walcott 217). But forgetting is a form of loss, and by forgetting names, places, and people, the island suffers. What was once Iounalao, becomes St. Lucia, and the men who contributed to the island’s growth become merely myths: but the builders’ names are not there/not Hector’s ancestors, Philoctete’s, nor Achille’s (Walcott 315). It is both that the colonial history of the island forgets the builders and Iounalao as well as they forgetting themselves. For those to whom history is the presence/of ruins, there is a green nothing (Walcott 192). To do so is not an act of submission or resistance, but merely a natural part of life.

What Coetzee’s Magistrate and Walcott’s characters (specifically Plunkett and the poet-narrator) aim to do is place their own memories of themselves and their places into a larger historical narrative; for those who are lying prostrate as Walter Benjamin puts it, to rise to their feet. Memory then is a mechanism used to make, assert, and insert unique stories into a history. Yet it is not only a question of how and what individuals remember and how they represent their memories, but also what might be christened a cultural struggle over the creation and meanings of memory within culture; the ways in which the very means and possibility of remembering are created (King 5). For the Magistrate, Coetzee creates a solo lamenting the somewhat invisible injustices of the Empire’s frontier, and how this one voice will be the only one to tell the truth of what has happened to the people at the back of beyond. For Plunkett, and the poet-narrator, Walcott creates a chorus singing the island St. Lucia, and her ordinary inhabitants, living ordinary but meaningful lives. Yet in both songs, the authors, and their characters, embrace their memories into the Histories.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"The Image of Mary, Mother of Jesus, in Matthew and John
Mary: Jesus' Foster Mother","In the books of John and Matthew, Mary's role as a mother is discredited in both passages because she is not given any voice in any decision making process regarding the conception, birth, and life of her child. She also is not given any authoritative power to regulate her child's behavior within the text. Although there are differences in how she is presented in Matthew and John, she is not given respect or authority as Jesus' mother in either book. In Matthew, she is acknowledged as divinely yet potentially unwillingly impregnated with Jesus by God and in John she is mentioned casually in the text, diminishing the magnitude of a mother-child relationship.

In the book of Matthew, Mary can be viewed as victim of divine rape. We are told in Chapter 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. The text does not say that she found out she was with child from the Holy Spirit, it just says she was found to be with child. This leaves the reader pondering the question, who found out she was with child and how was it found out that she was with child? Later in the text it says ...an angel of the Lord appeared to him [Joseph] in a dream and said ‘Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit (Matthew 18:20). Only later does it say that the Angel of the Lord revealed to Joseph in a dream that she was with child from the holy spirit. We as readers can assume that because this is the first explanation of how Mary became pregnant within the text, this may very well be the first time she received information and an understanding of what was going on within her own body.

If this is true, the text tells us that the message, terms and guidelines of Mary's pregnancy were delivered through Joseph, who at that time had not become her husband. We do not know if Mary was aware of this prior to it being revealed to Joseph in the dream, but we can assume that she did not because this was the first mention of it in the text. Generally, a woman is the first person, with the exception of her medical doctor, to know that she is pregnant, and has the final decision in what to do with her child, unless she is a minor. This concept is made null and void because the text tells the reader that Joseph had more knowledge, and thus power, over her body than she does. This takes away from her role as mother because the text gives Joseph total dominion over her body. It sets readers up to look at Jesus' paternal figure as more knowledgeable than his maternal figure, both in divine (God) and in the flesh (Joseph).

Another silent spot within the text is how God planted the seed within Mary. As discussed in class, there are several different words for the English word virgin, and each may have its own interpretation. The text references Isaiah when it says Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel. Depending on one's interpretation, we can assume that Mary had never had sexual intercourse. God may or may not have mated with Mary, but there is still a void within the text as to what exactly took place for her to become pregnant.

The text also does not say that God had made an arrangement with Mary, or why God had selected Mary to be the carrier of Jesus. Thus we can conclude that Mary's pregnancy may not have been consensual. The text also does not reveal what Mary's emotions were about this situation. It is possible that she was happy to be pregnant with the son of God, but she may have been very angry that she did not have a choice in the situation. Because the text does not tell, we can assume that her opinion ultimately was viewed as unimportant or irrelevant to the story.

In the book of John, Mary's role as mother is discredited because the text opens up with an intense introduction of Jesus as the divine son of God. In John 1:1-5, it says

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

We are not explicitly told that this passage is referring to Jesus. However later in the book, chapter 14:6, Jesus clarifies this passage by saying ...I am the way, and the truth, and the life, No one comes to the Father except through me. This tells us that the Jesus is the life being referenced, thus the passage puts a disclaimer on the magnitude of the relationship between God and Jesus. By saying He was in the beginning with God we can infer that God truly cherishes Jesus, leaving little room for Mary to be able to have a motherly bond with Jesus because he is already so close to his divine Father.

It is also evident that the book of John downplays Mary's role because the first introduction we have to her is in Chapter 2:1-5. In the very first verse, it says On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. In this text, Jesus' mother never even receives a name. She is simply referred to as the mother of Jesus. In addition, Jesus' relationship with God as his father was announced in the beginning of the book, so that readers can clearly recognize how close they are. In comparison to this, the sentence that shows the reader who Jesus' mother is ...and the mother of Jesus was there sounds like an afterthought or a common courtesy as opposed to intense, pertinent information.

Her role as mother is further discredited when we see Jesus backtalk her in Chapter 2:4—And Jesus said to her, Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come. The footnotes in the text say that the word woman is a term of respect and affection and cross reference other chapters in the book of John. However, in Genesis 2:23 we are told this at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken. This gives the reader the impression that because Jesus is referring to her as Woman, he views himself as her superior, rather than humbly acknowledging her as his mother. We know that he always refers to God as Father (example: ...The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me (John 5:36), but he does not refer to Mary as mother. Also, his response to his mother can be interpreted as selfish, arrogant and snappy toward his mother because he says “what concern is that to you and me  and  my hour has not yet come. However, he never talks or responds to God in this tone. We can assume that Jesus respects his relationship with his Father, God, more than he does with Mary, discrediting her role as his mother.

In both Matthew and John, readers are made aware that Jesus had an earthly mother, yet the text does not give her the credit she deserves as mother. The text tells us that God is the ruler and father of Jesus, and ultimately there is no mutual common ground between Jesus' relationship with his father God and his relationship with his mother Mary. Mary is still perceived to have had a hand in Jesus good will, yet her authority will always be superseded by whatever male is available.",0,25.07,42.46,32.16,7517
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Deep Sleep And The Inability To Exist In Works of Fantasy,"In Gábriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, insomnia hits the focal village of Macondo, spreading like a virus throughout. This plague causes memory loss in all it affects, going so far as to cause the villager's loss of comprehension of their very own language. This insomnia serves as a metaphor for the detrimental effects of a discordant individual upon society, instilling the loss of identity amongst an entire culture. In other works, this metaphor is often reversed, highlighting the detrimental effects of an incompatible society upon the individual. Likewise, the use of insomnia is replaced with its opposite: sleep, to which the appearance of deep sleep in works of fantasy symbolizes a character's inability to live in an unfulfilling world.

Virginia Woolf's title character in Orlando finds himself increasingly polarized by the world around him, leading to his general dissatisfaction. Yet Orlando is tired not of himself, but of the discomfort of…his way of life, and…the primitive manners of the people (Woolf, 23). With a sense of being in direct contrast with the environment around him, he finds the world oppressive and distressing. Orlando copes with these feelings in creating a persona discordant with his inner self, chang[ing] from a sulky stripling…to a nobleman, full of grace and manly courtesy (Woolf, 31). Finding himself in contrast to the constructs of society, he changes himself to operate within the customs of his environment. Yet in betraying his true feelings, Orlando finds only temporary bliss, interchanging moments of joy with fall[s] into…moods of melancholy to which he only think[s] of death (Woolf, 33-34). With his masquerade of character providing no relief, he seeks only escape from this unfulfilling world. Faced with the irreconcilable rift between himself and society, Orlando chooses to leave his external life, instead lay[ing]…as if in a trance where he does not wake, take food, or show any sign of life for seven whole days (Woolf, 49-50).

E.T.A. Hoffmann's Nathanael in The Sandman too finds himself in a substandard world that cannot reflect or cultivate his own passions. His impassioned letters to Klara express his feelings of impending doom loom[ing]…over [him]…like black clouds…impervious to every ray of friendly sunshine (Hoffmann, 93). The very fervor that drives his existence meets nothing but dilapidation in his surroundings, stagnating his growth. With Klara the personification of his society, their love is plagued by some dark hand which…intrude[s]…into their lives, snatching away incipient joy (Hoffmann, 108). Nathanael's paradigms prove antagonistic to the foundations of the community he lives in, disallowing him the capability of experiencing true happiness. Nathanael must seek relief from societal constraints, found only in Olimpia, the only one that truly understand[s…him] (Hoffmann, 118). The only escape he can find from a gloomy and austere world is found in a reflection of himself in the automaton. With the eventual revelation of Olimpia's true being, Nathanael can only find true escape in a deep and frightful dream (Hoffmann, 123).

With his initial escape from the world in the deep sleep, Orlando hopes to find fulfillment in other lands, only to be greeted with the same melancholy constraints. Again needing an escape from a repressive world, Orlando enters a deep sleep, and can only be awakened from the blow [of]…one terrific blast: The Truth! (Woolf, 102). It is only through truly finding ones true self that one can find true bliss. In this acceptance, Orlando begins to path towards a life of contentment, fully realized in the fact that Orlando had become a woman (Woolf, 102). This metamorphosis serves to unmask Orlando's true self, and with this revelation, hope to find meaning in a previously unfulfilling world. Indeed, a new love of Nature [is]…inborn in her, with new perspectives and streams of thoughts (Woolf, 106). Eventually, this cultivation of character allows her to find meaning in the right time and place, leading to pure ecstasy (Woolf, 240).

Where Orlando undertakes a complete transformation of sex and eta to achieve fulfillment, Nathanael cannot transcend his own time period after his own awakening from his deep sleep. The same world driving him into his deep sleep greets him upon his awakening, making him feel as if he is the horrible plaything of dark powers, [to]…which it [is]…in vain to resist (Hoffmann, 107). For all of his attempts at change, he finds himself unable to overcome such an environment. In climbing to the topmost gallery of the tower looking down into the hoods, Nathanael realizes the vast extent of his restricting society (Hoffmann, 124). With his very survival dependent on societal constructs, he realizes that he cannot find happiness in this realm. As such, Nathanael finds his only means of escape, to destroy his sources of discontent in a circle of fire, concluding with a shattering scream [and]…jump… from the tower to his death (Hoffmann, 125). Nathanael's only hope for true liberation and fulfillment lie outside of this world, which he can reach only in death.

It is through a strictly natural cause that Márquez's village of Macondo rids itself of the magical plague of insomnia: a traveler brings medicine that cures the illness to the land. Yet to do the opposite – resolve the problems causing a deep sleep – requires just the contrary: Woolf's Orlando undergoes a metamorphosis, Hoffmann's Nathanael is set ablaze upon the sight of his nemesis, Lewis Carroll's Alice must undergo the tribulations of Wonderland, and Sleeping Beauty receives a magical kiss from her prince. Where societal factors lay behind the destruction of civilization, behind the destruction of one's inner self lays metaphysical origins, often demonstrated through the use of the fantastic.",0,0,0,0,5863
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Anti-Aristotelian Kane,"If the purpose of art is, as Aristotle posited, to mimic reality, then the paradigm of classical tragedy and Kane's contemporary play Blasted represent two radically opposed methods for accomplishing this. The constituent elements of contemporary drama such as plot, character, and setting remain largely similar to their ancient antecedents in the Greek Dionysia. The difference is found in the methods by which playwright's like Kane implement, synthesize, and subordinate these elements to create a new form of mimicry for what might arguably be considered, despite the assertions of postmodernists, a similar human reality. Aristotle's analysis of tragic elements and the qualities that allow them to succeed ultimately yield a model for tragedy in which causality, order, morality, and balance are mimicked and an idealized reality reflected. Kane's Blasted completely inverts the Aristotelian paradigm by depicting a reality that is seemingly random, chaotic, amoral, and imbalanced.

In his analysis of tragedy, Aristotle subordinates all constituent elements to plot. That is to say, plot rather than any other element is the ideal vehicle by which the tragedy progresses. Though characters intersect with plot, indeed, even advance it, the Aristotelian model for plot stands independently of character, ultimately providing the instigation for their actions. In this sense, characters give the mere illusion of volition as they act because they are ultimately reacting to influences beyond their control, events that fall within the realm of plot. The impetuses of these events are external as in the conditions of the environment, decrees of fate, or interventions of gods. For example, in Oedipus Rex, presumably the tragedy closest to Aristotle's ideal, characters such as Tiresias, the Shepherd, and the Messenger arrive in the play to deliver information about events that concern mortals like Oedipus, Laius, and Jocasta but do not originate with them. It is ultimately revealed that any actions such characters took during these events were motivated by the prophecies of Apollo delivered by the Delphic oracle. In this way, actions that human characters appear to undertake are instigated by external, typically divine or cosmic influences.

However, the events in Blasted, rather than externally imposing themselves onto characters, arise from the actions of the characters. In the first scene, for instance, the events are confined to the interactions of Ian and Cate within the setting of a small hotel room. For much of the scene, they are little more than antagonistic gestures and dialogue, though Ian's sexual misconduct toward Cate motivates her, in part, to abandon him. The only event that one might construe as having an external impetus is the arrival of the soldier. While this event does admittedly impose on Ian and seems to originate beyond the scope of his interactions with Cate, it still occurs within the scope of character. In contrast to Oedipus Rex in which characters bear the decree of gods and fate through the accounts they relay, the soldier enters the immediate present of Blasted on his own volition. In these ways, the play is character-driven rather than plot-driven in the Aristotelian sense.

Ultimately, the plot-driven tragedy, especially in the classical tradition, affords its protagonists relative blamelessness as they become little more than vessels of some divine or cosmic design. Because of this, their tragic fortunes evoke pity and the lessons reflected in them can be applied universally. A character-driven tragedy forces the onuses of volition and action back onto the character. Consequently, the faults that lead characters down the tragic path are their own, as are the devastating results. In this way, classical tragedy asserts an interpretation of reality in which humans are subjected to influences beyond their control and thus, their innate morality remains intact. In Blasted, by contrast, Ian reflects on the lack of god or cosmic justice quite literally in a conversation with Cate in the fourth scene:

Ian: No God. No Father Christmas. No fairies. No Narnia.
Cate: Got to be something.
Ian: Why
Cate: Doesn't make sense otherwise.
Ian: Don't be fucking stupid, doesn't make sense anyway. No reason for there to be a God just because it would be better if there was (Lines 102-109).

This might be considered Ian's most significant moment of recognition after he is blinded and left for dead. He realizes that the idea of God is impossible; he recognizes that misery, universal and personal, is human. In this sense, the play asserts an interpretation of reality in which humans choose for themselves the ways in which they transgress and thus, they willingly eroding any innate morality they might have once possessed.

The play's plot, in addition to arising from characters rather than imposing itself on them, is discordant with classical standards of tragic causality. Aristotle asserts in Poetics:

The function of the poet is not to say has happened, but to say the kind of thing that would happen, i.e. what is possible in accordance with probability or necessity. […] Of simple plots and actions, the episodic ones are the worst. By an episodic plot I mean one in which the sequence of episodes is neither necessary nor probable (16-17).

Here he claims the ideal plot grows out of itself organically, following a logical, self-contained trajectory. The plot must be probable in that it is something that could plausibly happen and necessary in that it is what must logically happen. Again, using Oedipus Rex as an example, the plot follows causally from the murder of Laius, to the plague on Thebes, to Oedipus' quest to uncover the truth, and finally, to his tragic recognition of it. Such plots, despite the horrendousness of their ends, give the impression of ordered action and consequently, an ordered reality. The implicit argument of such a structure is that no matter how dire one's fortunes change, their circumstances ultimately accord with a sort of cosmic logic.

The plot of Blasted, by contrast, is almost entirely devoid of any discernable elements of this sort of logic. The action of the initial scene primarily focuses on the emotional and sexual abuses Ian commits against Cate. The soldier's entry the hotel room and Cate's escape represent a critical break in the causality. The reader or audience catch Ian's diffuse allusions to a back-story that acknowledges the possibility that somebody dangerous might come through the door. However, apart from this and a vague foreboding evoked by Ian's possession of a revolver, there is nothing within the scope of the play's action, dialogue, or descriptive passages to indicate that the soldier's intrusion is inevitable. There is no reference through the stage directions or in the conversation between Ian and Cate to any other specific characters that might find their way into the hotel room. It could be a local war-scavenger, refugee, or one of Ian's former co-workers who enters as easily as it could be the soldier. In this sense, the event can be loosely interpreted as probable but definitely not as necessary. As such, it injects the plot with a certain element of randomness.

Furthermore, it truncates the events centered on Ian and Cate, creating a new sequential thread in which the focus becomes the interactions between the Soldier and Ian. This new event sequence is characterized by a discursive, unpredictable, seemingly random progression of dialogue and action. This discursive quality is reflected in the stage directions during the end of the third scene and the beginning of the fourth:

He kisses Ian very tenderly on the lips. They stare at each other./ […] He pulls down Ian's trousers, undoes his own and rapes him—eyes closed and smelling Ian's hair. The Soldier is crying out. Ian's face registers pain but he is silent. When the soldier has finished he pulls up his trousers and pushes the revolve up Ian's anus./ […] He puts his mouth over one of Ian's eyes, sucks it out, bites it off, and eats it. He does the same with the other eye./ The solider lies close to Ian, the revolver in his hand. He has blown his own brain out (885).

Just as there is little, if any, discernable structural logic in the soldier's initial arrival, there is the same absence in his actions. The Soldier's tendency to alternatively and simultaneously behave with tenderness, savageness, nostalgia, calculated cruelty, and lamentation perhaps represents the pinnacle of diseased psychology within the character and disordered causality within the plot. It is the tortured logic of insanity that leads him from committing a rape to committing suicide. Ultimately, as events of the play are reflected in the insanity of the character, it must be concluded that the world Kane represents in her play is similarly insane and the mimesis she attempts stands in drastic opposition to the ordered, moral, and otherwise logical mimesis of the Aristotelian tragedy.

Kane's Blasted depicts a world that is amoral, disordered, illogical, and in almost every other way antithetical to classical tragedy. Rather than asserting any sort of implicit rhetoric about cosmic order by subordinating character to plot, she elevates character above plot. Thus, she brings depravity and the responsibility for it back into the human realm. Rather than constructing a plot arc causally linked by probability and necessity as Aristotle suggested is ideal, she shapes one that resists clearly definable teleology and inevitability. Thus, she depicts a world that cannot be confined to any sort of precise logic and consequently, cannot be depended on for order or justice. Kane and Aristotle both seem to agree that the fundamental objective of art, specifically dramatic tragedy, is to mimic reality. However, interpretation of the reality in which the philosopher or playwright chooses to situate that mimesis remains entirely subjective.",0,0,0,0,9983
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Classical and Modern Representations in O'Neill,"The playwright Eugene O'Neill brought many innovations to American drama. His voluminous works reflect a harmonious integration of elements from anachronistic and seemingly disparate traditions such as classicism, modernism, impressionism, and naturalism. Further, much of what make such a heterogeneous texture of dramatic writing so rich are its implications for what it means to be human. Specifically, if literature is supposed to offer examples of how it is people can, should, or actually do live, it makes sense that human life should be represented multi-dimensionally with different people, in different settings, struggling against different obstacles. In this sense, O'Neill brings to audiences and readers plays that portray tragedy within the self and outside of it, arising from the mind as well as acting upon it. Two of his major dramatic works reflect this pattern in his writing: Mourning Becomes Electra and The Iceman Cometh. While Mourning Becomes Electra demonstrates a more classical, circumstance-oriented view of human life through treatment of character as the sum of his/her actions under the influence of cosmic forces, The Iceman Cometh reflects a more modern, psychologically-oriented view through its exploration of the tragedies of characters' inner lives.

O'Neill draws directly from dramaturgical and thematic elements of Aeschylus' The Oresteia to create the dramatic trilogy Mourning Becomes Electra in truest adherence to the conventions of classical tragedy. As one might expect in this context, characters are represented through their actions in opposition (or according) to some idea of fate and the supernatural forces upholding it. In keeping with the spirit of classical tragedy, characters' missteps, both intentional and unintentional, are punished in a way congruent with some idea of a just and proportionate cosmic balance. Similarly, the tragic effect arises from characters' recognition of the significance of events that have occurred within the scope of the play's present. This immediacy of action and temporality restricts the expression of characters' psychology to the ways in which it manifests directly in the plot, through action.

One dramaturgical device in particular epitomizes the classical convention of fate predominating over any sense of agency or choice a character might have: the possession of the progeny by the dead progenitors. After the murder of Adam Brant and the subsequent suicide of Christine Mannon which occur in The Hunted, the first act of The Haunted begins one year later with Orin and Lavinia assuming the physical and postural aspects of their same-sex parent. The reader is given these descriptions of Orin and Lavinia:

Then Lavinia enters […]. One is immediately aware of an extraordinary change in her. Her body, formerly so thin and undeveloped, has filled out. Her movements have lost their square-shaped stiffness. She now bears a striking resemblance to her mother in every respect, even to being dressed in the green her mother had affected […]. [Orin] carries himself woodenly erect now like a soldier. His movements and attitudes have the statue-like quality that was so marked in his father. […] The Mannon semblance of his face in repose to a mask is more pronounced than ever (384-385).

In this sense, the possession by their parents has begun. However, its initial manifestation in Orin's and Lavinia's reflection of their parents' superficial qualities grows more influential, eventually acting on their behaviors until they quite literally become their parents. This transformation is almost never demonstrated through soliloquy or many of the conventional methods for exploring characters' psychology. Rather, it is demonstrated through character action and interaction.

As The Haunted progresses, this possession begins to form one of the play's main antagonistic thrusts: the tension between Lavinia as she is her mother and Orin as he is his father. The guilty Mannon conscience consuming Orin, presumably instilled by the ghost of Ezra, and the selfish, scheming duplicity Lavinia develops while inhabited by Christine altogether become the main vehicles of conflict driving the play forward. An example is found in these two passages during the rising action in the second act:

Lavinia—(with a sudden flare of deliberately evil taunting that recalls her mother in the last act of ""Homecoming,"" when she was goading Ezra Mannon to fury just before his murder) […] I'm not your property! I have a right to love!

Orin—(reacting as his father had—his face grown livid—with a hoarse cry of fury grabs her by the throat) You—you whore! I'll kill you! (401).

Orin—(with quite a mad insistence) Can't you see I'm now in Father's place and you're Mother? That's the evil destiny out of the past I haven't dared predict! I'm the Mannon you're chained to! […]

Lavinia—(putting her hands over her ears) For God's sake, won't you be quiet! ([…] unconsciously repeating the exact threat she had goaded her mother to make in Act Two of “Homecoming) Take care, Orin! You'll be responsible if—! (402).

In both these passages, it becomes apparent that as Orin and Lavinia inherit the ghosts of their parents, they inherit the sins they committed in life. As the siblings recreate the argument leading up to Ezra Mannon's murder, Orin's lines illuminate the thematic implication readers or audiences are meant to understand: the doom of the children is for them to become their parents and their past. Ultimately, the trajectory of the possession culminates in Lavinia's stunning recognition (as well as the reader's) as she finally understands and distills the significance of the play's events into the lines I'm bound here—to the Mannon dead. […] It takes the Mannons to punish themselves for being born (423).

Ultimately, O'Neill recreates in this play the notion which resonated throughout so much classical tragedy: a person is their actions (despite their lack of control over them). By driving the play forward entirely with the plot, audiences and readers see characters represented almost entirely through their sequences of actions and reactions. Similarly, the influence of the fate factor via the supernatural possession ensures that they are sufficiently punished for their transgressions. Finally, the tragic effect of the play arises from the character's recognition of the significance of her actions. Any attention given to character psychology is incidental. In the world portrayed in Mourning Becomes Electra, a human being is provoked, acts and reacts under the influences of forces they often do not understand, is punished, and purified by the recognition of how they have transgressed against the cosmic order.

In The Iceman Cometh, O'Neill works within a more naturalistic, modern, and character-driven context. The back room at Harry Hope's bar serves as the space in which the audience watches characters interact. By setting the majority of the action in this location, O'Neill creates a grotesque reflection of Ibsenian setting. Whereas in an Ibsen play, a Victorian drawing room might come to epitomize and evoke Northern European bourgeois society, in The Iceman Cometh, the back room of the bar becomes iconic of Skid Row alcoholism and sets the stage for a play whose focus is a subgroup of some of the most dejected characters to be found within the working class. The single, confined bar setting restricts the possibilities for characters' actual physical action to whatever can be performed within its proximity. Indeed, within this limited space, characters do little more physically than drink and sleep. However, it is in the sense that this claustrophobic feeling opens up space in the characters and on the stage for the dynamics of the inner life that the play's modernism arises. The play contrasts with Mourning Becomes Electra most significantly in the sense that characters' psychology is brought to the forefront at the limitation of their actions. Similarly, the most significant events occur outside of the scope of the play's present rather than within it. When the scope of physical mobility is limited, actions must arise from, and ultimately have their impact on, the richly written dimensions of characters' psychology. It is in this way that O'Neill deviates radically from most classical notions of action. Rather than relying on the actions of characters under the influence gods or fate to reveal characters and yield representations of human life, he illuminates the realm of characters' psychology as the precursor to action or inaction.

Indeed, through its primary antagonistic force, Hickey, the play seems to most directly focus on what characters are not doing rather than what they are. When Hickey arrives and attempts to convert his former friends with a message of existential reform, the main antagonistic thrusts of the play begin: those between Hickey and the other characters and between each character and his conscience. When Larry admonishes Hickey for attempting to disabuse another character, Hickey responds:

[…] I have pity but now I've seen the light, it isn't my old kind of pity—the kind yours is. It isn't the kind that lets off easy by encouraging some poor guy to go on kidding himself with a lie—the kind that leaves the poor slob worse off because it makes him feel guiltier than ever—the kind that makes his lying hopes nag at him and reproach him until he's a rotten skunk in his own eyes. (With a salesman's persuasiveness) No, sir. The kind of pity I feel now is after final results that will really save the poor guy, and make him contented with what he is, and quite battling himself, and find peace for the rest of his life (88).

In his proselytizing, he calls into question the nature of each character's delusions, or pipe-dreams. Though the other characters resist these attempts at conversion in their own ways and to varying degrees, many of them begin to question the validity of Hickey's observations. They realize (but seldom admit) that despite Hickey's abrasiveness, he is often fairly accurate in his assessment of their pipe dreams. As many of them begin to confront their delusions by making preparations to resume the failed endeavors that led them to the bar in the first place, the tenuous connections holding their group together become threatened. As characters uncomfortably and unwillingly rise to higher levels of self-awareness and become forced to confront their own issues, their deeply suppressed and long-held tensions with other characters come to the forefront. In this way, O'Neill creates a community of characters whose ability to exist and coexist relies solely on their capacity for codependent self-delusion. As he examines the question of what happens when that delusion is disabused, he highlights the profound dynamism of stagnation and the influence of character psychology often as instigator, means, and end of action.

Beyond this, though, O'Neill seems to remain adamant that no single character exist above the influence of this delusion, even Hickey. As Hickey tries to save the other characters from their pipe dreams, he reveals traces of his own. Collectively, these traces lead up to the revelation that his newfound perspectives regarding personal agency, self-awareness, and redemption through the erosion of delusion, are the mask with which he has covered the murder of his wife and the madness that results. Even more ironic than this revelation is that it happens in every other character but Hickey. After his entire crusade against pipe-dreams, he is led off to Bellevue with his own pipe-dream intact, ultimately proving the most grossly deluded character in the play. In this way, the culmination is in the revelation of Hickey's inner state rather than some sort of lamentation of recognition arising from a reflection of the events surrounding it. The fact that the play's most tragic character retains his pipe-dream until the end attests to the inescapability of delusion despite one's earnestness, deeds, awareness, or stature. In the world reflected by The Iceman Cometh, people's lives their lives in the delusion of what they should, could, or deserve to be as opposed to the reality of who they are and what they do. Ultimately, by the definition O'Neill asserts with this play, the most profound tragedy occurs not as a result of circumstance or fate, but in the realm of a person's psychology.

With Mourning Becomes Electra, O'Neill creates a classical representation of human life in which tragedy arises from the way a person recognizes their mistakes relative to a higher moral order. In this representation, there are forces that control a person that remain beyond their control, conspiring to maintain a cosmic balance in which transgression is balanced with proportionate punishment. In this representation, a person is their actions rather than their thoughts. With The Iceman Cometh, O'Neill creates a more modern representation of human life in which tragedy arises from a person's psychology, specifically their capacity for self-delusion. In this representation, notions of the moral order or cosmic balance governing reality are obscured because people do not share an objective reality. In this representation, a person is their thoughts and not their actions. With these two dramatic works, O'Neill gives readers and audiences a richly-textured portrayal of human existence.",0,0,0,0,13460
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,THE LADDER: Sexuality of Ancient Greece as an instrument of social mobility,"Anacreon once wrote a lyric which included the lines,  I love Cleobulus, I am mad for Cleobulus, I gaze at Cleobulus. 1 Because this Cleobulus is in other fragments named as a boy, may we then assume that Anacreon was homosexual? Or does that modern term not apply to the Ancient Greeks? Any argument for Anacreon's sexual aberrance (by contemporary Western standards) would be complicated, then, by others of his poems in which he longs for a girl. And then there is his admiration for a slave. Taking the poet's full collection into account, then, might suggest desires motivated by some other factor than male flesh. But what is sexuality without the sex-object? David M. Halperin suggest that Greek and Roman men..generally understood sex to be defined in terms of sexual penetration and phallic pleasure, whether the sexual partners were two males, two females, or one male and one female. 2 The ancients' choices pertaining to sex, then, would seem to be modeled more on some sense of power or male completeness rather than on individual sexual object choices.

In fact, considerations of anatomical sex (male or female) differences do not seem to have entered into the minds of the Greeks at all. Though they realized that a man and woman paired were required to propagate the species, Diotima-via-Socrates-via-Plato claims that it is an equally salubrious fate to focus instead on the birthing of beautiful, good ideas between friends. Furthermore, the beauty exhibited in all bodies is one and the same. 3 So in a group consciousness which placed no definite distinctions between the physical male and female, the right and wrongs of sex was necessarily placed on other views of societal appropriateness. Artemidoros, a popular dream analyst of the time, clarifies that 'Natural and conventional' acts are all those in which a man penetrates a social inferior…, is penetrated by another man, or masturbates. 3 In other words, because social inferiors of a Greek man were understood to be their wives, slaves, or young boys of a lower social class, ancient sexuality was not sexuality at all (in the way that we know it as individual sexual preferences based on the phenotypic and biological differences between men and women), but a complicated political network through which a Greek man was expected to ascend to power.

For example, in Pindar's Olympian ode, the poet mentions a reworked history of Pelops, the ivory-shouldered man who so captured Poseidon's fancy. Though he ostensibly played the penetrated role in the subsequent relationship, the fact that it was to the god of the seas made it an unnatural coupling to be foreborn. What makes Pelops a strong, respectable masculine figure is that he confronts Poseidon with a bold proposition – that if the god appreciated his sexual services, Poseidon will help him win Hippodameia, the glorious daughter of a king in Pisa, as his wife. The god consents, and the princess bears Pelops six sons to become lords of the people. 5 Here, we see a sexual choice made with an eye to a long-term sociopolitical agenda. Though Pelops did (perhaps shamefully) become the lover instead of the masculine beloved, a lover may submit to any form of servitude to his beloved without shameful servility…[and] servitude which has for its object the acquisition of excellence. 6

The wisdom of sex for personal gain is a fickle one, though. As a tool for social mobility, sexual nature may be called into question when, like Timarchos, the personal gain is deemd to be waste and unnecessary excess. Such a man, Aeschines (read: the Greeks) reason, who would sell his body for money when he has squandered his own inheritance, could easily sell the nation in a position of higher power. Note, however, that the judgement again falls not because of Timarchos' sexual objects (men), but because of the social interactions through which he becomes acquainted with them.7

With these various textual examples, then, we have arrived at the conclusion that sexuality did not exist in its current dichotomy of homosexual – heterosexual in ancient Greece. Rather than anatomical differentiation, people were arranged into genders of masculine or feminine, terms dependent upon much older stereotypes of dominant social behavior and independent of an individual's biological sex. Because it is the masculine, penetrative form that was seen to be the most fit to govern, sexual choices ultimately pointed to desires for personal, social, and/or political gain rather than any innate inclinations. For the ancient Greeks, sexual identity does not organize the person but is peripheral to the central goals and worries which are focused on survival. 8 It is, unsurprisingly enough, the same brand of self-interested sexuality which would appall and disgust even many impious minds of today.",0,0,0,0,4826
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Margery Kempe's Self-Fashioning: Visioning Herself in God,"The Book of Margery Kempe, considered to be the first autobiography written in English, presents the story of a woman whose life is guided by visions of, and conversations with, God. By recounting her holy visions, she gains authority with Church officials and is able to travel widely across the known world. Margery (ca. 1373 –1440) is certainly an atypical woman1; she pays her husband's debts (Kempe, 60), composes her own autobiography despite illiteracy, and travels extensively without constant companionship of her husband. As James Brundage notes, medieval women – regardless of their social class – tended to live most of their lives in their homes (Brundage, 493), so to travel outside of England was quite an accomplishment on its own. In this context, and with the consideration of her self-description as a meek and passive woman, it seems puzzling, at first, that she was able to live such an active life and gain so much authority with Church officials across Europe and even in Jerusalem. This is not, however, the paradox that it may immediately seem to be. In fact, Margery's self-crafting and self-recitation of her divine visions provide the very allowance – both personal and external – that she needs in order to engage with the world as an active participant.

Throughout the narration of her incredibly active life, Margery rhetorically creates the sense that she makes no choices of her own, but is instead wholly guided by another – that is, God. Within the language she uses, she strips her own active agency from the narrative. When describing her many meetings with influential people, she writes that she uttered many good words as God would put them into her mind(Kempe, 61). The words she speaks are God's, not her own. Even her abundance of tears come from without herself; she tells the reader that, in a vision, God commanded, you may not have tears … except when God will send them to you, for they are the free gifts of God, distinct from your merit (66). From the beginning of The Book, Margery describes inhabitation or possession; her hysteria and sinful nature are caused by the presence of an inner demon who acts upon her. She posits a simple cause-and-effect relationship for her actions:

[T]he devils called out to her with great threats, and bade her that she should forsake her Christian faith and belief, and deny her God, his mother, and all the saints in heaven, her good works and all good virtues, her father, her mother, and all her friends. And so she did. […] just as the spirits tempted her to say and do, so she said and did (42).

Here, Margery narrates her obedience to the commands of her possessors. Despite the costs – God, family, virtue – she explains that she does exactly what was asked of her, with no objection. She is a being who is fully under another's control. Even in her pious life, her piety is not for any specific choice she makes, but because Christ had worked his grace in her (43) and gave her great devotion (108). She fits this narrative perfectly into the model set before her of how to receive visions: almost all of her advisors tell her to be obedient to the will of our Lord and fulfill with all her might whatever he put[s] into her soul (78), and to be humble and meek (80) in her role as a medium. As Margery describes it, her life includes very little deliberate agency, and consists of obedience, rather than choice.

Margery goes even further than demonstrating voluntary obedience – she explains that, even if she wanted to exercise control over her own actions, it would not be possible. In Jerusalem, she could not keep herself from crying and roaring though she should have died for it, and that she fell down because she could not stand or kneel, but writhed and wrestled with her body 2 (104). In her telling, she is not responsible for her tears, convulsions, her physical responses, because they come not from herself. The reader is led to conceive of her as a vessel for God's choices, with no available means or alternatives to what He wants of her. Even her obedience is inactive and in no way volitional. She does not even own the fundamental self-control that allows the agency of choice.

This image, however, is self-consciously crafted. Margery narrates in the third person and refers to herself only as the creature, distancing herself from the act of composing the manuscript. This creates rhetorical distance from the kind of narcissistic authority that is often found in autobiographical writings, and would undermine her position as an obedient conduit for God's word. The phrase the creature implies an artistic act external to that creature – there is a creator, God, and a created-one, Margery. With each self-reference as such, she implicitly emphasizes that the relevant artistic act is not of a narrative, not of an autobiography, but of the ultimate act of creation: human life. Whatever her motives for this self-naming,3 the result is that attention is diverted from the inherently active nature of composing a text, and Margery is, again, the passive object of creation, rather than the active subject of her own autobiography and life.

If we reconceive her rhetorical crafting of this story, we can read the shifted agency not as essential female passivity, but as a way for an illiterate medieval woman to gain control over aspects of her life. Because she is not responsible for her actions, nothing that she does or says can be her fault. Those who criticize her actions or physical responses are immediately cast as heretical; her word is inseparable from the word of God. She has permission to travel widely in God's name, to speak with Church officials in private chambers, even to challenge their own piety to their faces.4 Margery's critics malign her for wearing all white, but she reports that God tells her, you shall dress according to my will (67) and that she dared not do otherwise than as she was commanded in her soul (68). Through reporting her vision, she can actively counter the assumption that she is a troublesome, self-intentioned woman, and provide divine documentation that she is, instead, fulfilling the proper role for a medieval woman: obedience. For a reader or companion who shares her values, this obedience is necessarily lauded as obedience to God, despite her overt and insistent disobedience to her male companions. Her vision frees her from the burden of self-responsibility or accountability for this earthly disobedience. Divine authority also allows her to offer rebuttals, such as when a Bishop tells her to wait to return from Jerusalem to take her vow of chastity, and she counters his assessment as she had been commanded [by the Lord] (70-71). The narration of her visions gives her permission to act in a strikingly forward manner, despite the veneer of being a mere, meek receptacle.

Margery's manner of telling is also a strategy by which she accesses control over her audience from within the text. She massages the reader's perception, deliberately guiding them to a sense of her as pious and obedient, even when the underlying facts belie that impression. The most overt example of textual manipulation in her Book is a parenthetical note at the close of the sixteenth chapter, which says, Read first the twenty-first chapter and then this chapter after that (73). To the modern reader – and likely to one of her contemporary literate readers – this is a crude stylistic device. But in as disjointed and episodic a text as this one, in which there is no overarching literary form, such fashioning must be considered as a deliberate and thoughtful attempt at rhetorical manipulation. With the textual leap to chapter twenty-one comes the announcement of a seemingly abrupt pregnancy, perhaps meant to evoke an immaculate conception. This pregnancy, in fact, begins with a divine annunciation, much like the Biblical Immaculate Conception. In a revelation, our Lord said to [Margery], Daughter, you are with child (84). The chapter proceeds through a vision in which Margery communes with God and the Virgin Mary, who both praise Margery for her pregnancy. God tells her that this pregnancy is no sin, and they both laud her and validate this conception (84-85). Margery, in this vision, is aligned directly with Mary Magdalene […] Mary of Egypt, St Paul, and many other saints that are now in heaven, and less directly – through repeated mentions of God's own blessed mother – the Virgin Mary (85). These reminders of the Virgin Birth and praise of Margery's virtue blatantly demonstrate to the reader that God Himself considers this conception a blessing.

Chapter seventeen tells a different story, however. In the very first sentence of the chapter, Margery writes of giving birth to her other children and of a visit from God in which He tells her that she should bear no more children (73). This seemingly unequivocal decree, though, seems all but irrelevant by the time the reader finally returns to chapter seventeen. By crafting the reader's movement through the text, Margery virtually bypasses this information without omission. She skips reminding the reader of her previous children – the reference of which would undermine the effect of the rhetorically abrupt pregnancy as well as the correlation to the Virgin Mary – and also prepares the reader for her becoming pregnant before revealing that Jesus commanded her not to. The reader already knows how happy God is to see Margery with child at the point that he or she reads the commandment not to become pregnant again. By interrupting the chronology of this narrative, Margery avoids presenting herself as disobedient of God's commandment not to bear any more children, as she undoubtedly would if the events were placed in their proper chronology.

Beyond a rhetorical level, Margery's visions also benefit her own emotional life. One function of her visions is that they allow her to develop an interpersonally intimate relationship that is more symbiotic than her relationship with her husband. The kindest words Margery has for her husband come in the first chapter, when she says that he always had tenderness and compassion for her (43). After this, however, he is not presented as an emotional mate, but rather as a barrier to her holiness, insisting that they have sexual encounters against her will. When she refuses, he tells her, You are no good wife (58). At one point on her travels simply writes she did not know where her husband had gone (64). He largely falls into the background of her story, literally disappearing for years. In an early conversation with God, she says that she would choose her priest as her companion to heaven more than [her] own father or [her] husband (55). From this, it is fair to assume that Margery and her husband had a tense, possibly even antagonistic, relationship, as she likely saw him as the embodiment of her sexual sins, even as someone who would be willing to put her life at risk for his own sexual pleasures,5 and for his part, we at least know that he expects more from her in fulfilling the obligations of marriage. Medieval marriages were not necessarily loveless,6 but love was not requisite to the marriage, and tended to grow out of the conjugal debts, according to John T. Noonan, who quotes Thomas: a man loves his wife principally by reason of the carnal meeting (Noonan, 255). The carnal meetings that Margery and her husband share, however, do not strengthen Margery's relationship with her husband, and rather than contributing to a developing love, they are a source of anguish and tension.

In contrast, Margery's visions bring her into a symbiosis with God that is more akin to the language and sentiment of marriage than anything she speaks of her husband. In her visions, she and Christ are bonded. God expresses to her many times that they are a unit, saying, I am in you, and you in me (Kempe, 57). This is a statement that can be read as sexual, Eucharistic, and also familial. To integrate all three of these modes of reading this complicated image, the repeating image is simply that of mutual communion with the Lord, in which He is just as eager to take her body into His. The reciprocity of their relationship even inverts the directionality of expected devotional writing (in which Margery would promise penance to God), and Margery narrates that God tells her, if it were possible for me to suffer pain again as I have done before, I would rather suffer as much as I ever did for your soul alone, rather than that you should be separated from me without end (65-66). The singularity – and emotional dependence – with which God devotes Himself to Margery is as startling as it is affectionate. He tells her that wherever she goes, he go[es] with her, including both to church and to bed; their togetherness spans both night and day (66). This resembles a domestic marriage more than it resembles the expected Christian understanding of God's devotion to mankind. Noonan, citing a 13th century monk and theologian, writes, In marriage there is a certain singleness of love in which an outsider does not share … There is mutual love and therefore mutual zeal, and therefore singleness (Noonan, 256). This is entirely consistent with Margery's narration of God's expressions of love to her. God tells her that she is a love unlike any other (86). He repeats the word singular many times to describe how particularized his love for her is, as she is his own blessed spouse (88). God expresses a mutual and singular love for Margery, giving her access to a mutually beneficial and enriching relationship that she would otherwise not have. The benefits of such a relationship are not found in any text, but are arguably located within Margery's continued energy and determination to continue on her journey.

Margery not only allows herself to feel loved and cared for through her visions, she also finds emotional validation and familial comfort from heavenly voices. When she feels inadequate or fears that she is in danger, a holy voice intervenes to soothe her. While fearing attack on her travels, God says to her with paternal assurance, Don't be afraid, daughter, your party will come to no harm while you are in their company (98). St. Anne and Elizabeth also refer to her as daughter in an anxious moment, Anne telling the disheartened Margery, I am well pleased with your service, and Elizabeth, it seems to me that you do your duty very well (53). God enters when Margery doubts herself, and tells her that he loves her, or that she has no reason to be afraid or troubled. Within the narrative, Margery is calmed by these familial and intimate appeals, and on another level, they provide divine authority that Margery very rarely does wrong in the eyes of God. Her visions are soothing voices, quelling her angst about her own life – and serving the additional purpose of convincing the reader that her angst and self-criticism are unfounded.

Margery's state of mind is relevant in that the visions provide her with an internal opportunity to circumvent the messages she receives from many external critics of her devotion and lifestyle. Along her spiritual journey, skeptics and believers alike question her and her visions. Even the priest who served as the scribe of her book finds it necessary to test her feelings, and for a long time would not always give credence to her words (91). She repeatedly has to persuade those whom she meets to believe her. One of her confessors is very sharp with [her, and] considers [her visions] merely trifles and jokes (80). The assumption going into a situation with unfamiliar people is that they will not believe [her] words, which results in this creature [Margery] suffer[ing] a great deal of tribulation and unhappiness (81) because of the difficult nature of being a self-proclaimed mystic. Without the emotional security from the visions, Margery would likely not have the boldness and endurance to continue to do so. The validation she receives from the visions, then, can be read as responses of empowerment to continue living her life as she has been: she affirms from within that she is doing the right thing and has the emotional support and singular love of God.

From a critical standpoint, it is worth examining what Margery has to gain from these visions, even for a wholly trusting reader. The content and rhetoric of the visions tend to cohere into an extremely self-serving model, even in moments when Margery describes her own overwhelming misery. Through envisioning a complex familial, sexual, and devotional relationship with God, Margery gives herself permission to love, to do, and to feel. More tangibly, Margery's visions allow her to lead an active life, to travel and engage in significant theological discourses with important people, to have influence on people's faith, and to grant herself her own emotion fulfillment – all while fitting her behavior into the expectation that she should be, above all else, obedient and passive. If we were to extend the hypothesis into the purely speculative, and assume briefly that Margery is fully conscious of the crafting of her story with only selfish motivations, the means by which she achieved the desired ends would be incredibly close – if not identical – to what she narrates in her Book. Working within the prescribed role of obedience to God, she finds incredible self-assurance, activity, and self-possession. However, even without assuming such a fundamental dishonesty on Margery's part, it is fair to presume that these visions were – even subconsciously – a self-fashioned way of entering and engaging with the world in a more desirable way.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"Learning One’s Place in the World
An Analysis of the Evolution of Eve’s Understanding of Natural Patriarchy in John Milton’s Paradise Lost","John Milton invokes the aide of a muse at the beginning of his epic poem Paradise Lost in order to help him navigate his expansion upon the Biblical tale of the Fall of Man from the Garden of Eden. Fully aware of the enormity of the task before him, Milton asked for personal divination in order to assert Eternal Providence, / And justify the ways of God to men (25-26).1 Milton’s voice is unmistakably present within the story of Eve’s fall as the Biblical text does not provide sufficient dramatic details for his purpose. Through the evolving nature of Eve’s character and her understanding of God’s purpose for her through Adam, Milton subtly comments on the essentiality of patriarchy and the inadequacies of women. Even though her self awareness develops in Paradise, the resolution of the Fall results in her return to inferiority and complete dependence upon her husband by her own accord.

In Book IV of Paradise Lost, Satan enters Paradise and nostalgically admires the beauty around him. As the narrator relates his observations of the first humans, his attention is drawn to their relationship as man and woman. The narrator separates them as he explains that

though both
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seem’d;
For contemplation hee and valor form’d,
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,
Hee for God only, shee for God in him” (295-299).

He qualifies his statement by stating that their sexes did not seem equal [my italics added]. Because the narrator does not absolutely understand the equality of man and woman, an initial doubt is instilled in the reader regarding the credibility of this comprehension. While this is not reconciled but instead glossed over, this seeming lack of his understanding makes the unequal nature of their relationship active and tentative. Adam and Eve’s sex here is not defined as secondary physical sexual characteristics or their genetic assignment as man and woman, leaving the interpretation up to the reader. If the inequality is founded upon on secondary sexual characteristics, then their division is based on superficial distinctions that comments on woman’s body as the defining factor in her subservience to man. This further suggests that if a woman has pronounced sexual characteristics and great beauty, then she is more inferior to man than a more androgynous woman. On the other hand, if the narrator is referring to their genetic sex as the limiting factor, then their division is based completely upon human design and every woman is equally inferior to man regardless of her physical or internal attributes. Milton maintains the site of distinction between man and woman as sexuality.

Adam, as the narrator asserts, was created for contemplation and valor, whereas Eve was made for softness and sweet attractive Grace (297-298). The dissimilarity between their purposed creations is striking and definitive. The characteristics for which Adam was created are stereotypical of the alpha male patriarch as intellect and valor are traditional and respected masculine traits. Contemplation and intellect reflect the Protestant admiration and concern with education as influenced by the Protestant Reformation. Adam, then, is the Protestant male archetype by creation. The purpose for which Eve was created does not refer to internal characteristics and aspirations as it did with Adam but to her physical nature and beauty, eternally demeaning her. Soft beauty is depicted as the quintessential physical splendor and focuses on delicacy. Her sweet attractive Grace, however, adds a commanding dimension to Eve as Grace is one of the greatest Christian attributes. Grace is understood through the Protestant tradition as God’s loving kindness, especially as related to atonement of sins through Jesus Christ. Even though Eve was created in part for her beauty, she is also given this powerful role which reflects Milton’s modification of the traditional construction of patriarchy. Milton struggles with this tension of patriarchy as he oscillates between damning Eve and exploring her voice.

Adam, as Satan continues, was created for God whereas Eve was created for God in him (Adam): Hee for God only, shee for God in him (299). The division between man and woman is declared didactically as man being the conduit for woman’s relationship and understanding of God, giving man absolute rule over woman’s spiritual life. This patriarchal hierarchy appears to be naturally designed in Paradise and suggests that male domination and female subservience is natural and divine order. The purpose for which Eve was created foreshadows the source of Adam’s Fall as well as her eventual need for Grace and atonement. As Eve’s journey in Paradise begins, so too does her understanding of her position in Paradise and in God’s design.

Satan observes and relates Adam and Eve’s first dialogue exchange as they end their first day together. Adam is first heard modeling for Eve how to praise God and the importance of doing so. He then immediately moves into a lecture about the rules of Paradise. From the very beginning, man is responsible for showing woman how to talk to God and setting the boundaries. The relationship between praising God through words and through following His rules emphasizes the need for obedience by woman. Woman must be obedient in praising God properly as Adam did and also by following the rules that Adam relates. In order to be obedient to God, Eve must be obedient to Adam, thus knowing God through Adam. In this transfer of obedience, Eve is always inferior to a male figure.

Adam refers to Eve as his sole partner and sole part of all these joys / dearer thyself than all, which foreshadows what will become his major flaw, his view of Eve as his completion. While this romantic and wedded speech demonstrates the love between the two first humans, Eve’s address to Adam is more submissive and mortal. Eve refers to Adam as for whom / And from whom I was form’d flesh of thy flesh, / And without whom am to no end, my Guide / And Head and honors his statements: what thou hast said is just and right (440-443). She understands him as her guide and her intellect, confirming the purpose Satan relayed for Adam’s creation. After mimicking Adam’s language and also praising God, Eve relates her birth narrative to Adam in an attempt to take ownership of her language.

Eve’s first thought, as she narrates, was where / And what [she] was, whence thither brought and how, demonstrating that she had free thought even from creation. Her creation, though, foregoes the normal development of a newborn to an adult and she begins her life as a fully cognitive and aware adult. As she explored the land, she found a stream where she admired her physical beauty. She was pleased with the shadow that returned her stare and pin’d with vain desire until God warned her not to slip into sin (466). This first experience with her beauty is a warning sign that alludes to the future Fall. Within the first moments of her life, Eve has been drawn to sin of the flesh. God suggests that if she does not look upon herself and follows Him, then she will not stray; however, Adam will look upon Eve’s beauty every day and that will be his fall. After God asks Eve to follow Him, she responds, what could I do, / But follow straight, invisibly thus led? (475-476). Following blindly behind a her Maker, Eve positions herself in a subservient position. Even though she did not know of any other way to live in this new world, the construction of this scene creates a commentary on woman’s need to follow a person of higher social standing in order to survive and the importance of education and logic to prevent blind following. There is a poignant irony in Eve’s birth narrative as she dominates the speaking in comparison to her husband. One could interpret Eve’s zealous and loquacious speech as her attempt to compensate for her inadequacies by female birth. Even though she shows her husband that she owns her birth narrative, she still wanted Adam in her company when she told the story. This couples her struggle to understand her inferior role as a woman and her love and appreciation for Adam as her other half.

As Eve concludes her birth narrative, she romantically and gracefully recalls seeing Adam for the first time:

Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim
My other half: with that thy gentle hand
Seiz’d mine, I yielded, and from that time see
How beauty is excell’d by manly grace
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair” (487-491).

Eve’s understanding and recognition of Adam as the one from whom she was created surpasses common intellect. She was not told of how she was created, but in Adam she recognized part of herself. This union of their beings is reflected in her description of beauty [being] excell’d by manly grace (490). Eve is taking the traits of beauty and grace for which she was designed and attributing them to Adam by stating that Adam’s grace is greater than her beauty. Because of this move, she is honoring him at the same time as she positions herself as the giver of attributions. She willingly makes the two qualities for which she was created diminutive to Adam’s characteristics. At the same time, however, she is telling him that they are one in the same and acknowledging that she is part of him.

Adam and Eve remain obedient to their design as they act and speak in accordance with the purposes for which they were made. Adam is the intellectual rule relater and Eve is the fragile beauty; thus is God’s blueprint: so God ordains, / God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more / Is woman’s happiest knowledge and her praise (636-638). Eve reiterates here that God is Adam’s ruler and Adam is Eve’s ruler. In this understanding of the order of power, both Adam and Eve are subordinate to a higher power and are both debased. The degree to which each is subordinated is dependent upon gender, though, and emphasizes Milton’s modification of the traditional patriarchy as even man is inferior to God. Another one of God’s intentions was that Adam and Eve could help themselves to anything in Paradise except the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Because Eve had some of Adam’s characteristics in her, she tried to use her intellect to be more productive in work; however, because she did not have the full amount of contemplation that Adam was bestowed, her logic was doomed.

In Book IX, Adam and Eve begin another day of labor in Paradise in which both Adam and Eve work in the garden. In this utopian society, Eve is expected to work as Adam does, creating dissonance in the qualities of this man-run Eden. Within this tension, Eve struggles to understand where her feminine role ends and where Adam’s role begins. As Eve accounts what is left to do, she suggests, Let us divide our labors, thou where choice / Leads thee, or where most needs…/ while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt (214-218). She assures him that they will be able to see each other and interact but that our day’s work brought to little, though begun / Early (224-225). Eve tries to assume the role of the authoritarian delegator here but Adam’s response mocks her for her fruitless attempt to act as a man. He turns his mocking into a patronizingly response which praises her for her intellectual attempt and claims that there is nothing lovelier…/ In Woman, than to study household good, / And good works in her Husband to promote (232-234). Adam’s comment removes Eve from the spotlight and puts his superiority back into the focus of her self-understanding; the husband is the one to do the work and is the primary actor in all decisions. Even though a woman can study the household good, the man takes those observations of the woman and promotes them for his own betterment and purpose.

He continues by reminding her that there is a malicious Foe / Envying our happiness and that it would be most prudent to stay together to protect each other (253-254). Adam’s didactic nature continues by concluding his argument: The Wife, where danger or dishonor lurks, / Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays / Who guards her, or with her the worst endures (267-269). By suggesting that women are frail and unsafe to be left alone, Milton is suggesting through Adam’s voice that men must protect women and women should always stay by her husband’s side. Through Adam’s chastising, Eve is being punished for acting too much like Adam and yet not having the level of intellect that Adam possesses. Stuck in this middle ground between acting like Adam and not representing him well enough, Eve’s understanding of herself becomes compromised. Milton’s moralizing use of Adam and Eve’s dialogue to comment on the natural character of patriarchy is emulated in the climactic Fall of Man.

According to Milton’s elaboration in Paradise Lost, Eve eats the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil by the Satan serpent’s questioning of Eve; Eve caused her own fall. The Satan serpent tells Eve that he has touch’d and tasted, yet both live, / And life more perfet have attain’d than Fate / Meant mee, by vent’ring higher than my Lot which implies that because he had not died from eating the fruit, Eve wouldn’t either (688-690). By suggesting that seeing is believing, the Satan serpent tempts Eve into one of the greatest questions that Jesus Christ will teach his followers in the distant Biblical future. Jesus Christ proclaimed, Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed (King James Bible, John 20:29). This verse would have been known by the readers of Paradise Lost and Eve’s failure in believing that the fruit will not harm her by seeing the Satan serpent still alive would create discomfort in the knowledgeable reader. Milton even accounts that his [Satan’s] words replete with guile / Into her heart too easy entrance won and implies that if Eve had more of Adam’s contemplation and valor, she would not have fallen for her false logic (733-734). Once again, Eve is reprimanded for not representing Adam well enough. As Eve tries to rationalize what she is seeing, she assumes that she and the Satan serpent are equal and that the effect of the fruit will be the same:

In the day we eat
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.
>How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
Irrational till then.
(762-766)

Just before she eats the fruit, she pushes her rationalization into ambition to know virtue to make wise, and to thereby be more like her husband who has the cognitive abilities that she lacks (778). Even though the abilities with which Adam was created are markedly different from the knowledge gained from eating the forbidden fruit, the inference is that Eve wanted to know more. This desire for greater understanding suggests that she was not satisfied with her current gifts from God and therein, coupled with flawed logic and ambition, present the reason for Eve’s fall.

After Adam eats of the same fruit as Eve, they begin to quarrel and Adam places the entire blame upon Eve. He chastises her for not listening to him and says that this could have been prevented if she only stayed by his side. Eve’s response transfers the blame onto a hypothetical situation as she tries to bring her husband to her level: hadst thou been there / Or here th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discern’d / Fraud in the Serpent speaking as he spake (1148-1150). In her explanation to Adam, Eve claims that Adam would have fallen for the same deceptive trap that Satan set for Eve. Adam’s contemplation and intellect is being challenged by his wife, but Adam does not allow her bold remarks to remain unchallenged. Adam claims that he did everything he could: I warn’d thee, I admonsish’d thee, foretold / The Danger...And perhaps / I also err’d in overmuch admiring / What seem’d in thee so perfet (1171-72, 1177-79). He had fallen for the passion he felt for Eve’s beauty, her natural beauty was the cause of his fall. Milton uses Adam here as an enlightening model for his commentary on patriarchy as Adam finishes his response to Eve by saying that Thus ist shall befall / Him who to worth in Woman overtrusting / Lets her Will rule and that woman’s first indulgence in the presence of evil will be her husband (1182-1184). At the end of Book IX, Adam has these final words and Eve’s silence comments boldly about the power of Adam’s words and the invitation to the reader to contemplate the influence of will in patriarchy.

The angel Michael spends a considerable amount of time showing Adam the future turmoil and struggle of humankind as a result of his and Eve’s fall. When Michael instructs Adam to share what he has learned with Eve, Eve tells Adam that God has shared with her the very same information he had learned from Michael. Even though Adam cast Eve away when he saw the angel Michael coming down from heaven, Eve is on the same level of awareness as Adam. In a sense, God has made Eve equal to Adam through her dreams, but not in her conscious life. If the drama ended here, Eve would have developed into an intellectual equal of Adam under God’s eyes; however, Eve continues and willingly degrades herself because of her obedience and devotion to her husband through whom she knows God. She remarks:

But now lead on;
In me is no delay; with thee to go,
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
Art all things under Heav’n, all places thou (614-618).

In this final speech of the epic poem, Eve returns to the natural order and design by which God created her. This positioning has become her choice and she has chosen patriarchy by which to live. Milton infers that this is the proper choice to make as women, to be inferior to man but to always walk by man’s side, as Adam and Eve go hand in hand…[on] their solitary way, at the end of the poem (648-449). The resolution is peaceful and as such, Milton maintains his instructive style in the proper behavior of women through the Mother of the Human Race, Eve.

Milton’s sexual politics and construction of patriarchy are emulated through the character and evolution of Eve. Eve understands herself and her role as a woman through her interactions with Adam. Even though Eve has moments of power, she eventually resigns herself to a submissive and inferior position. This decision was hers as we have seen through her self-discovery; after all, God created free will and for Eve to be a slave to patriarchy would be to impugn God’s dignity. In order for Paradise to be regained, humans must choose patriarchy as the restoration of order.",0,0,0,1.43,18646
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Charity in the Character of Sir William Thornhill,"In the novel, The Vicar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith, one man describes Sir William Thornhill as a man who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good (136). Others, throughout the novel, make similar protestations of his goodness. However, for a character supposedly so good and decent, he does not take the actions he should in preventing his friends’, the Primroses, downfall. Similarly, he does not show as many instances of charity one would expect from someone considered so charitable (19). By taking a closer look at Sir William’s character, it is clear that he is not as deserving as everyone in the novel believes he is of the many kind descriptions attributed to him, and as a friend, he leaves much to be desired.

Sir William states of himself, At present, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before; but still he preserves the character of an humourist, and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues (20). Yet, after having not given up charity completely when realizing his previous mistakes, it is hard to understand why Sir William would not show more charity to his friends, the Primroses, especially since right after their meeting the Vicar tells him of their late misfortunes (18). In fact, other than saving Sophia, an act that actually requires no charity, saving a dog stealer, and the money he spends at the end of the novel, he performs no charitable acts. All of the charity ascribed to him was done in the past, and for a man supposedly given to reckless charity, it is hard to believe there would not be more instances with regards to his new friends.

In addition to hardly showing charity to his friends, he takes from them. It would be one thing if he went around masquerading as poor while never taking from others less fortunate than himself, but he does take from others. When Sir William is first seen in the novel, he is asking for money from the inn keeper and then after being denied, is given money by the Vicar (18). These people all have less than he does so it seems unkind to accept from them money that they need more than he does, especially when the Vicar has six children. Sir William states that he is glad that a late oversight in giving what money I had about me, has shewn me that there are still some men like you (18). Surely, though, he could observe charity in the world while still not taking from others. Later, as his visits to the Primroses become more frequent, he begins helping them in the field, which to a degree makes up for his taking from them, yet it is hard to believe he would not offer more to them than gingerbread and boxes, especially given the many hardships the family faces as the novel progresses (54).

While these instances are important in noting how is character is not quite as worthy of the titles he is given, they in no way proves it as much as his unkindness to the Primrose family does in not taking further means to prevent Olivia from being seduced by his nephew, Mr. Thornhill. At the end, Sir Williams says to the Vicar, It is impossible…that I should forgive you, as you never deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it! (149). This is not true. It was certainly not out of his power to restrain (149). He could have done any number of things to prevent this from happening. Sir William could have further told the Primroses of Mr. Thornhill’s villainy, or he could have revealed himself as Sir William if they needed further proof, or he could have simply forbid his nephew from acting the way he acted or cut off his money. Surely, by then he had known enough of the Primroses’ benevolence to give up his masquerade for something as important as saving their daughter. The fact that he did not and only pitied them is both cruel and selfish. A truly charitable person would go out of their way no matter what the cost to save friends.

This seduction and removal from her family was no small matter. It was only by chance that the Vicar found Olivia. What if she had not made it back? What if she had starved to death? The danger to more than just her character was simply too high for Sir William to ignore, although saving her character alone still should have been enough to induce him to intervene. Furthermore, if his refusal to take further measures was only out of indignation because of his previous fight with the family, or to teach them a lesson, then is was too unkind a lesson.

Sir William says at the end of the novel, of his nephew’s actions, Good heavens! How every new discovery alarms me, which could provide proof that he did not know the lengths to which his nephew would go to satisfy his lust, but that is hard to believe as well (158). Olivia says to her father that Sir William took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the artifices of Mr. Thornhill, who I now find was even worse than he represented him (109). Knowing that Mr. Thornhill had artifices at all makes it hard to accept that Sir William did not know the full length of his nephew’s artifices (109). Even if he did not know the full lengths to which Mr. Thornhill would go, there is really no acceptable length for letting someone, let alone a friend, be fooled. In other words, apprehensions are apprehensions and no matter how small, if he had reason to believe something bad would happen then that should have been enough to persuade him to take a stronger course of action. He should have also notified the entire family of Mr. Thornhill’s character. If Olivia was in love with Mr. Thornhill, then it is not hard to believe that she would not act on or believe his warnings. Granted his letter did show the Primroses his disagreement with Olivia and Sophia’s trip to London, but he did not explain or defend his actions, and it is natural that they should think his disagreement was based on his love for Sophia (68-69). Furthermore, the Vicar states, So saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure, left us, quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance (68). It is hard to believe him kind when he smiles, because he knows they do not know all that he does about Thornhill’s character; therefore, he has to suspect that something bad might happen. In addition to that, it is hard to believe a true friend would leave people he cares about so easily and without defending his actions. It seems as though that would have been the perfect time to reveal his true identity, saving everyone so much pain.

There is other proof throughout the novel that Sir William knew more about his nephew than he leads on at the end. For example, when George goes to get help from Sir William after having fought in a duel for Mr. Thornhill, Sir William calls him the instrument of his vices (97). This means that not only does he know his nephew gets into duels, but he then must also know there is a reason behind all of these duels. Furthermore, Sir William’s lack of surprise at someone like George showing up and asking for help further confirms he knows what types of things his nephew gets into. In addition to this instance, Sir William repeatedly says fudge! to the two ladies employed by Mr. Thornhill to deceive the Primroses. Although he might be saying, fudge, because he does not care for their characters or because he does not want the Primroses to believe them and go to town with them, and not because he does knows who they really are, it is uncertain. Yet, given how much he knows about his nephew’s business in terms of his nephew’s marriage and the role Sir William plays in that marriage by drawing up the papers, it is therefore easy to assume that he might know a great deal more about what his nephew does and who visits him (161). Similarly, not being all the time under the guise of Burchell, he also must know who is of rank and who is not, which means it is plausible he could know all along these ladies are not who they claim to be. If that is the indeed the case, then he should have been more upfront about it to the Primroses, because that would be a great injustice towards them on his part.

Sir Williams says, I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most esteem. I have long been a disguised spectator of thy father’s benevolence (152). Having said that, it is hard to then understand why, when he goes to such lengths to state his reverence for the Vicar and after warning Olivia about his nephew, he then goes to such lengths to protect Mr. Thornhill (155-156). Naturally, he could feel it is his duty as an uncle, but after discrediting his nephew and proclaiming his friendship to the Primroses, it does not make sense. His inconsistency in his support of his nephew is confusing, and it seems he would be more apt to favor the Primroses, since all along any unkindness they showed him was out of fear of his threatening their daughters’ chances at making good marriages, which was something they greatly needed to get by, which as a man of class, he would know.

Lastly, as  a man whose character for every virtue was universal, yet just, Sir William does not act anywhere near as kind or just as the Vicar does (97). It is as though the Vicar is more deserving of Sir William’s praises. For his example, where Sir William seems unwilling to do his friends the kindness of fully revealing his nephew’s character, the Vicar is not unwilling. He sends a letter right away to Miss Wilmot to save her from marrying him (117). In addition to this, the Vicar has to insist that Sir William be more forgiving towards his nephew: Sir William was going to spurn him away, but at my request he raised him… (165).

Certainly, in the novel, the Primroses’ vanity and quest to be better than they really are, are to be blamed for what happens to them. Even so, as a self- proclaimed friend and widely proclaimed good man, Sir William should have taken better care of them and better care to prevent bad things from happening to them. When a friend knows something that could prevent his friends from impending calamity, then that friend does whatever he can to ensure his friends’ safety. Sir William does not follow this rule. He lets his friends walk right into danger, and no one who is actually charitable would do that.",0,0,1.08,3.5,10377
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,With Magic Comes Power: Exploring Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and Shakespeare’s The Tempest,"When an individual reads Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta and then sequentially reads Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, it would be difficult to argue that the stories did not have an influence on the other. Thematically, the characters of Barabas in The Jew of Malta and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice are ridiculed for being the religious other (in fact, for both being Jewish) and both seek vengeance on their Christian counterparts. The similarities are too obvious to be overlooked, however, these two characters also demonstrate differences in their humanity—whereas Barabas seeks the power that accompanies wealth, Shylock desires respect of the Venetians. The two stories diverge from the seemingly similar plot structures they portray, and in the end, produce original works that are reminiscent of each other while still maintaining their own authentic complexities. Marlowe’s Tragical History of Doctor Faustus and Shakespeare’s The Tempest follow this paradigm as well. More specifically, although Faustus and Prospero demonstrate similarities in relation to their intellectual desires and cravings for possessed magic and the power that accompanies it, Marlowe exhibits Faustus’ unwavering anti-Christian perspective and decision to obtain diabolic power while Shakespeare demonstrates Prospero’s decisive transition to renounce his art and embrace humanism.

Within the first lines that Faustus speaks, the reader becomes aware of the Faustus’ intellectual quest for knowledge. Throughout his life, he has studied and mastered Aristotle’s works (Marlowe 1.5) of philosophy, the field of medicine to become a physician (1.15), and the universal body of law (1.35). These fields of intellect, however, are not adequate for Faustus. Faustus desires a world of profit and delight/of power, of honor of omnipotence (1.53-54) and through Faustus’ logic, the only way in which this may be obtained is in becoming a studious artisan (2.55) and practice necromancy. Along with this, Faustus denounces Christianity and its divinity, paraphrasing half a verse from scripture and deducting that we must sin/And so consequently die (1.45-46). Marlowe expresses Faustus’ logic on the inadequacy of worldly knowledge explaining that the only solution is to become a sound magician for he is a mighty god (1.62). Faustus’ quest of ultimate knowledge goes beyond the humanly intellect as he cannot see past the triviality of these subjects. His search for knowledge leads him to the solution of demonic magic—which ultimately leads to his eternal damnation.

Prospero, too, shares this quest of knowledge with Faustus. In Prospero’s first conversation with his daughter Miranda, the reader discovers the reason why Prospero was banished as the Duke of Milan: In dignity, and for the liberal arts/Without parallel; those being all my study…I thus neglecting my worldly ends, all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind (Shakespeare I.ii. 73-74, 89-90). Like Faustus, Prospero seeks knowledge to the fullest extent, and by doing so, he neglected his duties as a duke and was overthrown by his brother. However, unlike Faustus, Prospero does not find triviality in human subjects, and it is through this laborious study of liberal arts that he is able to obtain magic. Caliban explains that if one can possess his books; for without them/He is but a sot (III.ii.92-93). The books that Caliban is referring to represent those given to him by Gonzalo as he was banished (I.ii.166-168). It is true that the island allows him to have the power of magic, but it is only through his study that he is able to control it. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the nature of Prospero’s art differs extensively from Faustus. He does not call up evil spirits or jeopardize his morality in order to control. In fact, when Miranda asks how they came to ashore, Prospero replies By Providence divine (I.ii.159). Where Prospero still believes in this divine entity, Faustus has abandoned it: Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub (5.5) and relies on his own power and the power of the diabolic. Shakespeare illustrates to the reader that the magic in which Prospero gains is unlike Faustus,’ and that his religious morality is still intact.

However, with saying this, it is important to note that both Prospero and Faustus struggle with the power that accompanies the magic that they obtain—be it demonic, moral, amoral, or spurned from a magical island. Faustus’ struggle to give up his magic and power lies within two principles in which he cannot break away from. Primarily, this struggle lies within his unwillingness to give up his indulgences: Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again. To God? He loves thee not: The god thou servest is thine own appetite (5.9-11). Marlowe demonstrates to the reader that Faustus is disinclined to abjure his magic because of the amount of pleasure he receives from it, prominent in the scenes in which he plays practical jokes on the pope, friar, and horse-courser and also through his sexual desire with Helen of Troy. However, the reader also becomes aware of Faustus skepticism in terms of the validity of hell as a reason for Faustus’ objection to renounce his magic. As Faustus explains to Mephastophilis that Come, I think hell is a fable (5.126), the reader becomes aware of Faustus’ negligence to fully repent, even after various opportunities with the Good Angel. Although Lucifer agrees with the condition that Mephastophilis shall do for him, and bring him whatever (5.99-100) Faustus misunderstands Mephastophilis explanation that there is a hell, and that Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed (5.120). In this perspective, Mephastophilis grants him a valid answer just as he wishes for in his pact—that there is a hell and that there is no place for it, just a state of being. Therefore, although the reader may want to reduce Faustus as an immoral and ignorant character at this point, the reader must comprehend that through Faustus’ overwhelming power, he fails to understand Mephastophilis’ message. Although given that there is a hell, Faustus’ own power and intellect clouds his mind, and therefore he does not feel the need to surrender such magic.

Prospero also struggles with sacrificing his power, and like Faustus, becomes too comfortable in the power that he possesses. Prospero’s magic prompted the tempest itself, as Miranda expresses If by your art, my dearest father, you have/Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them (I.ii.1-2) and the tempest was Prospero’s plan to gain his vengeance on his brother—but only through being able to control the individuals on the island. On the island, the shipwrecked crew from Milan is under his control, and he utilizes his magic and spirits to keep them in his captivity. But it is through his control of the island—and the individuals on it-- that he struggles with his power. Unlike Faustus, who fails to repent and remains unwavering in his perspective on the diabolic magic and power, Prospero undergoes a major transformation in his thoughts on power, exhibited by his speech to Ferdinand in scene IV as he reflects on the plot of Caliban to take his life:

Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on’ and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d
Bear with my weakness, my old brain is troubled (IV.i.154-159).

The solemnity, vexation, and troubled nature that Prospero illustrates to the reader in this passage expresses the realization of his role as a human—not as a deity or one who uses magic to controls others. By understanding that he, as a human being, will leave not a rack behind, and eventually perish, leaving no magic or power behind. It is not until now that he comprehends that life is more than vengeance, control, and power. The magic and power that he possesses now will not allow him to be immortal, and rather, he should enjoy his life as his daughter prepares for matrimony. At this point of the play, Prospero faces the human condition and recognizes that he was hindered in the false life of the magical. Although he forgets what it is like to be truly human throughout the course of the play, this passage exemplifies that he has regained this knowledge, knowing that his life is rounded with a sleep and that one day, he will perish, regardless of the magic or power he possesses.

Unfortunately for Faustus, this transition or epiphany to relinquish his powers does not occur—or, arguably, occurs too late. The complexity of Faustus’ last soliloquy mirrors the complexity of the magic and power that he has, and also the complex character that he has portrayed. Like Prospero, Faustus realizes that he too, in fact is a human, but his realization only signifies one message-- that he will perish and be eternally damned. Although the reader believes that within the hour he has left to live his last words will ring of repentance, they do not. Surprisingly, Faustus proclaims, One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah my Christ--/Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ;/ Yet will I call on him—O Spare me, Lucifer (13.71-74)! The reader fully expects that Faustus will give his soul to Christ, but in the last clause, alters his mind and stands firmly in the diabolic as he has done throughout the play, proclaiming Spare me, Lucifer! His stance—and consequently, his downfall-- is resolutely rooted in his belief in that the magic and power from Lucifer will save him. However, the complexity continues as the speech draws to a close. Faustus proclaims that This soul should fly from me, and I be changed/Unto some brutish beast:/All beast are happy (13.98-100). The man who proclaims his wish to become a beast is the same man who wished to be mighty god earlier in the work. The responsibility of his magic and power has now come full-circle. In all of his desires, power, and magic, his only desire now is for the powers to free him from his bond with Lucifer. One of the most desperate lines in the play occur in Faustus’ last words, exemplified by the dashes, pauses, and exclamation points: I’ll burn my books—ah, Mephastophilis (13.113)! His last words are haunting, not only because of his presumed damnation but also because of the first clause—‘I’ll burn my books.’ In his desperation, did Faustus wish to repent through burning the books of his demonic magic?

It seems as though Shakespeare believes so. In one of Prospero’s last lines, the rhetoric and diction used is uncannily similar to Faustus’ last words. Prospero explains that but this rough magic/I here abjure…I’ll drown my book (V.i50-51, 57). Again, as Caliban mentioned to his newly-found comrades in Act III, Prospero’s books represent his magical art and his power. Although the tones of the lines are much different, Propsero’s desire to free himself of magic and regain his life lies within his ability to rid himself of his book, and therefore his magic and power that he has on the island that he has resided for years. Prospero’s metamorphosis from a sound magician (to use Marlowe’s phrase) to one concerned with the worldly and humanistic again, occurs with the drowning of his book. Likewise, perhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that by Faustus proclaiming he would burn his book, his repentance too would be inevitable, due to his willingness to surrender his magic and power.

It seems almost too perfect that by relinquishing his power in the world of the magical, Prospero gains the worldly power of his dukedom in Milan. The moral of the play seems to echo some of Mephastophilis’ thoughts, that if something were made for man, therefore is man more excellent (5.185) and more concretely, in the epilogue of the play: Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits/to practice more than heavenly power permits (Epi.7-9). And of course, this is too perfect. As a Christian moral play, Faustus relies on the horror of demonic and diabolic magic and the craving of power (outside the worldly) to be the downfall of our tragic hero. But the reader has to be more aware of the complexities that both protagonists—and plays—instill. Although one can reduce a moral from each story and attempt to minimize a character as moral or immoral, the artistry of Marlowe and Shakespeare relies on the complexity of the plays and characters themselves. Without Faustus’ dramatic and multifaceted last speech or Prospero’s troublesome self-realizations, Marlowe and Shakespeare would not have achieved the representation of human characters—those who desire, contradict, realize, and feel-- without any magical powers whatsoever.",0,0,0,0,12688
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Female Bonding in Roxana,"The bond between Roxana and Amy is not a standard bond between two female companions. It is different from the bond that would exist between two women of equal social standing, and different even from the bond that would exist between a mistress and her maid. It is closest, in fact, to the relationship that exists between a husband and his wife, at least in the way these relationships were regarded during Roxana’s time. Roxana thus lives the life of a man in two ways—one, in being the sole manager of her affairs, and two, in having a kind of wife in Amy.

Amy and Roxana both hold a mutual affection for each other. Amy is devoted to Roxana from the beginning of their misfortunes, I was not able to pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet she would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any Money…she would help me out of her own. 1 Amy stays with Roxana despite having no prospect of ever being paid for her troubles, and remains with her through every turn of her fortunes. Roxana, too, relies on and values Amy, trusts her with managing her affairs even when she is absent for months at a time: leave Amy behind…with Directions to go to London, and stay there, to receive Letters and Orders from me what to do; 2 Having thus spent nine Months in Holland…[I] arriv’d safe at Harwich, where my Woman, Amy, was come. 3 Roxana looks after Amy all the time they are together, keeping her on with a salary whenever she has the means. Roxana even shows fear for Amy’s life during a storm at sea, while she is also in fear for her own life: I did not know whether she was dead or alive; in this Fright I went to her. 4 The bond between them must be strong, for they are together for the rest of their lives.

However, no matter how highly Amy esteems Roxana, Roxana esteems Amy to a much lesser extent. For instance, when Amy vows she would die for Roxana’s sake, Roxana’s only reply is, Why that’s an Excess of Affection, Amy, said I, I never met with before; I wish I may be ever in Condition to make you some Returns suitable. 5 Although Amy has essentially said she values Roxana’s life above her own, Roxana does not respond beyond mere pleasantries. Returns suitable is a trick of speech that could mean anything, and certainly doesn’t directly mean that Roxana would lay her life down for Amy. Roxana also deems it an excess of affection, which means Roxana herself doesn’t consider it normal or expected that Amy should feel this way, and she would likely never feel this way herself.

Roxana also maintains their status separation from each other throughout the book. Although they are often at equal physical standing with each other, as at the beginning when Roxana has no money, Amy is always under a title of lower rank than Roxana. And when Amy is dangerously close to appearing to have higher morals than Roxana is, Roxana forces the division to re-evolve by forcing Amy into bed with a man she is not wedded to: but as I thought myself a Whore, I cannot say but that it was something design’d in my Thoughts, that my Maid should be a Whore too, and should not reproach me with it. 6 Amy loves Roxana enough that she stays with her even after being treated thus poorly, but Roxana doesn’t esteem Amy enough to let her have a higher status than she herself does.

The bond between Amy and Roxana is paralleled with the bond between a typical husband and wife during Roxana’s time. One example is the general rule that when a woman gets married, all her money and estate are at her husband’s disposal, do do with as he pleases: a Wife must give up all she has…and be upbraided with her very Pin-Money 7; That the very nature of the Marriage-Contract was, in short, nothing but giving up Liberty, Estate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man. 8 This is paralleled in Amy’s relation to Roxana when Amy offers to support Roxana with her own money, and as long as she had any Money, when I had none, she would help me out of her own. 9 Amy forfeits her money to Roxana, albeit willingly, just as any money a wife had of her own must go to her husband when he has need of it.

Another clear parallel between Amy’s relationship to Roxana and that of a wife to a husband lies in the description Roxana often gives of a wife—that of an upper servant: a Wife is look’d upon, as but an Upper-Servant. 10 Amy begins as a maid to Roxana, but gradually occupies the position of an upper-servant in truth, because she manages most of Roxana’s household affairs. Amy also occupies, for a time, the position of a companion to Roxana, Amy, who I now dress’d like a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion. 11 Amy occupies the position of a wife because she is in Roxana’s confidence, she takes care of hiring the household staff, but she relies on Roxana for a home and companionship. Amy also has free command of Roxana’s coach and of some of her money, just as a typical wife would.

Roxana’s first husband sets the model with which Roxana judges all other marriages, and her life often reflects this model. Roxana’s first husband went abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and lov’d it exceedingly. 12 After her husband dies, Roxana herself goes abroad often, mingles with company of various societal standing, and it could be said she hunts men and enjoys it. Her husband didn’t care for working at a trade to keep his business flourishing, and preferred simply to spend money and not have to work to get it. Similarly, Roxana decides to earn money through offering bedroom favors instead of applying herself to an actual trade. She also shuns marriage as a result of her first experience with it, it had hurried me up and down in the World…that I had an Aversion to it. 13

However, Roxana lives the life of a man much more successfully than did her first husband. She manages her money and business affairs with such alacrity that she rarely needs the relations she keeps with men for more money: having large Sums to do with, I became as expert in it, as any She-Merchant of them all. 14 She also treats Amy with more trust and respect than her own husband treated her, having sent Any before-hand, and remitted her Money to do it, she had taken me a very handsome House. 15 This seems to suggest that the proper way for men to treat their wives in order to retain a happy existence is to follow Roxana’s model, because Roxana and Amy were both mutually happy while they were together and while Roxana had no husband.

Amy does, however, tend to stifle Roxana with her affections. Just as such stifling often drives men away from their wives and to mistresses and whores, so might this have been one of the reasons Roxana agreed eventually to marriage. Essentially, Roxana may have gotten married to escape Amy’s adoration, which reached a peak of frenzy at the beginning of Roxana’s second marriage. Amy’s relationship with Roxana was one of extreme affection, as was shown when Amy said she would die for her, and throughout the book when Amy went abroad multiple times for Roxana to manage her affairs. And just as Roxana grew sick of one of her lovers, it may be assumed it was possible for her to grow weary of Amy. Amy is the only person other than Roxana who knows all of Roxana’s secrets and everything about her life. When Roxana’s daughter Susan is on the verge of discovering everything too, Amy feels the need to murder her. It is not a far stretch to interpret part of her fear for Roxana as jealousy, because Amy wants to be the only one who fully knows Roxana. In fact, Amy began talking of murdering Susan even before they are sure she knows more than she should. It is just after Susan guesses Roxana might be her mother that Amy flies into a rage, and this rage is very likely tinged with jealousy of Roxana. This time, at the beginning of Roxana’s second marriage, is also when Roxana begins to become estranged of Amy, and eventually when she forces Amy out of her house.

In short, Roxana stops being a husband to Amy when Amy’s affections become stifling, and begins being a wife to her Dutch merchant (who is an exception to the rule of a husband who takes over his wife’s money). Roxana lives the life of a man for much of her life, then marries and lives the life of a woman for the rest. Thus, her marriage is not a break from her beliefs, but more a fulfillment of both these ways of living. In a way, Roxana lived a more complete existence because she had the experience of living like a man does, with a kind of wife in Amy, and living as a woman does with a husband. However, it is interesting to note that Roxana was most prosperous while she remained unmarried, a hint either that a woman is more likely to life well if she lives without a husband, or that only a man’s way of life can successfully retain money.",37.25,17.54,5.55,5.65,8763
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"The Purgatory of the Postmodern
Character and Action in Beckett’s “Godot” and “Endgame”","""That God does not exist, I cannot deny.
That my whole being cries out for God,
I cannot forget.""

-SARTRE

It seems that man has a rather paradoxical relationship with action. Our aphorisms include, Actions speak louder than words and Ben Franklin’s Well done is better than well said, but also, Do as I say, not as I do. It seems that we would prefer to predicate who we are upon our actions, unless our actions would shame us (in which case words alone will suffice.) Fictional characters function much in the same way— characterization often takes place by means of the action or actions an individual undertakes. But what happens to character in a vacuum? What is character without action, character separate from history and future? In Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and Endgame, the problem of character separate from action is scrutinized. Nothing actually transpires in either play, and in some ways, it is possible to equate Waiting for Godot with waiting for something and Endgame with waiting for nothing. In both plays, there is a plot, but no story. We are forced to consider whether Vladimir, Estragon, Hamm, and Clov are characters, and more importantly, what Beckett was attempting to say about human action through his use of the two pairs of unvarying male characters in these pieces. Though both works display static characters, Beckett treats the characters of Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot far more favorably than Hamm and Clov in Endgame, because action or the lack thereof is at the root of his characterization, even in the bleakest and most stagnant of his plays.

Characters in fictional and dramatic works are often conventionalized to some extent.1 There are typically protagonists and antagonists present in dramatic works of any scope, as well as what Phillips and Huntley call driver and passenger characters— drivers drive the action of the story and are often transformed during the process, and passenger characters are more static and simply ride the waves made by the driver characters.2 But just as Beckett’s postmodern plays violate expectations regarding length, content, form, and style, so too do they violate typical characterization. The means of typical dramatic characterization are totally absent in these plays. We aren’t able to learn about these men through their likes and dislikes, their relationships with others, their past, or their inner thoughts and feelings. And, most importantly for our purposes, we are unable to characterize them based on their actions because there are none. This is not to say that there is no movement whatsoever in plays— in fact, stage directions comprise a large part of the text of both plays. But what is lacking here is what I will call higher, or dynamic, purposeful action. Certainly, Estragon struggles to put on his boot and Hamm demands that his stuffed dog be brought to him, but these actions do not constitute the kind of dynamic action we are looking for. There is no action leading to a climax, resolution, or character evolution. There is no action compelled forward by the characters (or vice versa) either.

It seems that in both plays under consideration, both men in the pair are passengers. The question of who is the sidekick in the duos of Didi and Gogo or Hamm and Clov is impossible to answer. Vladimir, Estragon, Hamm, and Clov are neither protagonists nor antagonists. Rather, they are all halves, one part of a character that could be present in the play but is not. One man plus one man equals a little less than one man.3 Rather than one whole character, we are given two fractured characters with diametric personalities and inclinations. It is well known that Beckett was captivated by the American comedy team Laurel and Hardy. The duo complimented each other perfectly in a number of ways. One was tall and thin, the other short and stocky— one was the thinker, and the other was the doer. And this dichotomy remained the same in all of the pair’s misadventures.

As is the case with the pairs of characters in Waiting for Godot and Endgame, it’s impossible to say whether Laurel or Hardy is the sidekick or passenger character because in reality, both men are the sidekick. In Beckett’s Books: A Cultural History, Matthew Feldman describes Beckett’s work as a syzygy, or an archetypal pairing of opposites symbolizing the interplay of the conscious and unconscious minds.4 We might even say that Hamm, Clov, Didi Gogo, Laurel, and Hardy are less characters than they are archetypes of certain fragments of the human mind or human sensibility. But whether their high jinks took place in the desert or a dentist’s office, Laurel and Hardy were always doing something. There was action to be undertaken, tasks to botch hopelessly. In the plays at hand, the duos never truly do anything, which is the crux of the problem of characterization here.

Beckett was also intrigued by the character Belacqua in Dante’s Divine Comedy, perhaps to the point of obsession. Walter Strauss stresses that Beckett’s fascination with Belacqua emphasizes the relevance of the theme of expectancy to the modern spiritual dilemma and at the same time underscores the despair of the modern sensibility in the fact of it. 5 The paradox of this situation fits both plays, as does the stasis of this likeness to the predicament of Belacqua. But we feel the despair much more acutely in Endgame than in Godot. In the latter play, the curtain falls on the two men together, an image of humanity and companionship (if not friendship), and it seems that nothing is really at stake. Michael Robinson pointed out in his From Purgatory to Inferno that Once again Belacqua provides the image, but in Beckett this stasis is unrevoked [sic]: grace remains mute, the tremor of release never occurs, and the liberating angel, like Godot, does not arrive. 6 But is seems as if nothing changes by his not coming. At the close of Endgame, we feel crushed, awed. Considering that both plays have a similar structure and style, why is this? What makes Endgame so wrenching? What makes Hamm and Clov different as characters from Vladimir and Estragon?

Vladimir and Estragon do not really live— they merely exist. Similarly, Hamm and Clov never actually die or finish their lives— their days together merely end, as does the play. But for Didi and Gogo, Beckett seems to believe, at least there is the waiting:

ESTRAGON: What do we do now?
VLADIMIR: Wait for Godot.
ESTRAGON: Ah! 7

And even though after a silence, this interchange is followed by Vladimir exclaiming, This is awful! his anguish is of no importance at this stage. The point is that the pair has something, anything to wait for. They have an answer to the question of what to do next. Astride of a grave and a difficult birth may describe man, but at least there is something to do between the two extremes.

Endgame is a far more desperate play precisely because there is no higher action. What is most remarkable about the piece is the text’s ability to scratch and claw at the soul.8 Hamm and Clov’s There’s no one else and There’s nowhere else 9 as well as the individual speeches near the end of the play are only a few of the incredibly affecting moments in this play. Statements like these create a kind of unrelenting pressure that never ceases, not even when the curtain falls. Use your head, can’t you, use your head, you’re on Earth, there’s no cure for that! Hamm says, exasperated near the play’s end. The play must end because it is a play, but the misery never ends, it seems.

Whereas in Godot, where there is at least the possibility, however absurd, of waiting for God, of his existence, Endgame seems to warn against putting God before anything, even the most base, carnal desires. When the idea of prayer comes up, Nagg cries out Me sugar-plum! To which Hamm replies, God first! And then, from Hamm, we are given, The bastard! He doesn’t exist! 10 Beckett’s distinction does not necessarily connote a condemnation of stasis or a glorification of hope and action. He does not venerate the hopeful, waiting posture of the tramps in Waiting for Godot or the (ultimately meaningless) connections Nagg and Nell, Hamm and Clov, or Hamm and his dog have to each other in Endgame. It is the resignation that Beckett admires, and the resignation of his paired characters in Godot and Endgame permeates the text to the very end.

The final image of Hamm carefully shrouding himself beneath a handkerchief, alone in an empty room as he utters the word remain is strangely beautiful. But perhaps it is only beautiful because we have only seen pain, loss, and disappointment until this point, and in comparison, this moment seems stunning, gorgeous. In the same way that resignation and not hope is of primary importance in Godot, the fact that the beauty of the last image in Endgame is only discernable in comparison to abject misery, stasis, and emptiness is important. Beckett has painted two bleak portraits of postmodern purgatories that, perhaps, await us all. Without action, there can be no character and thus only resignation and stasis. The last word of the play is Hamm’s remain, 11 which again denotes the motionlessness of these circumstances. With that, Hamm places the handkerchief once more over his face, and the play ends, though it certainly isn’t finished, and it seems that for Beckett, nothing ever truly is.",0,0,0,0,9388
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"Cúchulainn’s Women, Loki’s Children
Power & Femininity in Two Mythic Figures","The Nordic figure of Loki and the Celtic figure of Cúchulainn represent two mythological extremes: Loki, the trickster of Snorri Sturluson’s Eddas, ostensibly embraces his ergi or feminine qualities, and uses them to his advantage. Cúchulainn, on the other hand, is ultimately defeated by the feminine power of Queen Medb, who draws him out to his death. Not only is Cúchulainn metaphorically killed by feminine power, he is continually stunned by women, immobilized by the sight of their breasts, and carries out their will repeatedly in the Táin Bó Cuailnge. This is made more interesting by the fact that both Loki, the son of a giant, and Cúchulainn, the manliest of Ulster men, possess some feminine qualities themselves. Both are said to use of magic and spells— a skill traditionally associated with women. Loki is said to become pregnant at times, and Cúchulainn’s famous warp-spasm manifests itself as an uncontrollable fit of emotion, an occurrence only seemingly acceptable in a male because it suggests itself only in the context of battles. Both Loki and Cúchulainn are ultimately killed in their respective myths, but their diametric conduct is indicative of two very different approaches to the presence of women and the feminine.

Loki is the trickster of Nordic mythology. His actions are always carried out for personal gain, typically at the expense of others. In and around his rampant roguery, Loki is firstly described as being feminine, and performs some extremely feminine acts as well. He is referenced as Laufey’s son, which is his mother’s name.1 This family name is of not because it goes against the Nordic tradition of including the father’s name with that of the son, not the mothers. Loki is also uncommonly beautiful. In the Prose Edda, he is described as being handsome and fair of face, but has an evil disposition and is very changeable of mood. 2 Having a variable temperament seems to be somewhat of a feminine trait, but the evidence of his femininity does not end here.

In his various episodes of trickery, we see Loki engaging in a number of feminine activities. He transforms himself into other forms, and in at least three of these tales, he changes himself into a woman.3 He also uses a number of artifices and types of magic, acts usually assigned to women in these myths. In the poem Hyndluljoth, Loki eats the half-cooked heart of a woman, becomes pregnant, and gives birth to the monsters that plague men, three of his own ghastly children: the Miðgard Serpent, Hel, and Fenrir the wolf. 4 In the Prose Edda, Loki is also said to have given birth to Odin’s horse, Sleipnir. From early on in the Eddas, Loki appears as a figure who easily and willingly transgresses gender boundaries, leading some theorists to note him as bisexual, homosexual, or queer in both senses of the word.5

Aside from the explicit woman-like actions Loki undertakes, other figures in the myths are said to have discussed Loki’s ergi qualities: In the Lokasenna, for example, Odin openly accuses Loki of being unmanly. Milking the cows as a maid, / (Ay, and babes didst thou bear; / Unmanly thy soul must seem, he says.6 There is even a story in which Loki ties his genitals to the beard of a goat (as John Lidow notes, the beard being a fundamentally male attachment to what is for all intents and purposes a female animal, the goat7) essentially castrating himself, to make the giantess Skaldi laugh.8

This broad range evidence does not necessarily to Loki being a degraded outcast, a homosexual, or a transgressor of genders. Carol Clover, among others, has suggested that the Nordic model of gender operated according to a one-sex model, which is to say, that men and women were considered to be of one gender, present in varying degrees of manliness or womanliness.9 If this were true, the derogatory term ergi, from argr, a word denoting effeminacy or unmanliness, frequently used to describe Loki, does not have as much sting as it would today. Indeed, Clover has written that the frequency with which various terms denoting femaleness is invoked with reference to men— compounded with the relative lack of language describing features exclusive to women— suggests that what was at stake was not effeminacy. The terminology was simply a way of describing someone who falls anywhere outside of the normative sphere of gendered behavior.10 In fact, women were often valued for having what we would consider a masculine trait: pride. In the end, what seems to have been of the utmost concern in these Norse myths was not a transgressing of gender, but instead any condition of powerlessness, however it was manifested.11

It is important to note, however, that as it reads in Sturluson’s Prose Edda, Loki’s torturous death was not brought on by being feminine, but for being evil and treacherous. Some scholars disagree, viewing the death of Loki with a more critical eye. Stephanie von Schnurbein sees more to this death than just punishment for Loki’s rampant treachery and killing of Baldr. Von Schnurbein suggests that it was in fact just this sense of Loki’s unnaturalness that made him a target of the Gods. Of Loki, Von Schnurbein writes:

He represents ""the effeminate"" man and, for that reason, not necessarily because of his malevolence, is subject to derision and considered evil. This is reinforced by his indeterminate class position: his is counted among the Æsir, yet he is often relegated to a subservient role vis-à-vis the gods. 12

Whether Loki represents a one-sex view of gender, a gender transgressor, or simply a trickster is a distinction that can be argued in many different ways. Nevertheless, Loki, with all of his feminine qualities, seems to get the better of his blunders until the time of his death, one could argue, because he accepts his feminine side, his ergi nature and the ways in which it manifested itself and made him different. In the Celtic mythology, unlike Loki, Cúchulainn is unable to embrace the feminine or control the women in his life, and instead attempts to rule over the feminine. In reality, he is ruled by women and all that is feminine, and eventually dies at the hands of a woman.

In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the hero Cúchulainn is described as being the manliest of men. He is uncommonly skilled in the art of battle, huge, covered in hair, and the object of desire of almost all the Ulster women.13 But even this man’s man is not without certain feminine distinctions. His name, meaning The Hound of Culann, is a starting point for this discussion of his connections and troubles with women.

Though dogs are typically viewed as being masculine, tough creatures, particularly guard dogs like the one Cúchulainn kills, some depictions of domesticated dogs among the Celts point to a certain degree of feminine denotation. The dog is portrayed in the Gundestrup Cauldron, and is associated here with the Gaulish goddess Sirona.14 And though Cúchulainn was a skilled warrior, he was trained in battle by the expert warrior Scathach, who was a woman.15

Cúchulainn’s infamous warp-spasm, a violent warrior rage that grips him before he fights, also seems a bit suspect when viewed in the context of his encounters with the feminine. While the descriptions of his warp-spasm in the Táin call to mind the male berserkers of Nordic lore, in reality it amounts to a complete abandon of the mental faculties and total surrender to emotions. The fact that these emotions are rage and pride are secondary to the fact that at the moment of the warp-spasm Cúchulainn is flooded with emotion and overtaken by his feelings, something surely not encouraged in men. Interestingly, the only way the people of Ulster could bring Cúchulainn out of these spasms was through more contact with women, as we will soon discuss.

But these references to Cúchulainn’s intimate ties with women seem almost coincidental when compared to his other encounters with the opposite sex. Though he is virile and handsome, it seems that most of his dealings with women end poorly, and in the last event, fatally. Indeed, James MacKillop titles two sections of Myths and Legends of the Celts concerning Cúchulainn Troubles with Women and More Troubles with Women. More than one reference is made to what some feminists have called the male gaze in the Ulster Cycle myths involving Cúchulainn— he is paralyzed by the sight of women.

After returning from battle in the fury of his warp spasm, the women of Ulster must rush out to meet him, bearing their breasts to stun him. While he is stunned, the men of Ulster grab Cúchulainn and throw him into three vats of icy water to calm him down. MacKillop writes that Cúchulainn stand[s] in awe of female beauty, sometimes in fear of it. 16 The troubles do not end here. In the tenth- and eleventh- century narrative Serlige Con Culainn agus Óenét Emire, or The Sickbed of Cúchulainn and the Only Jealousy of Emer, Cúchulainn continues to find himself in disadvantageous situations with women throughout his illustrious life, all of which is chronicled in these myths.17

In this tale, Cúchulainn leaves a game to retrieve beautiful birds for the women of Ulster. While hunting for them, he falls asleep and has a disturbing dream in which two attractive women thrash him with a horsewhip. They beat him for so long, in fact, that the life seems drained from him. 18 The women then leave without any explanation. Cúchulainn is then found, tired and ill, and carried back to Emain Macha, and lies in wasting sickness for a full turning of the seasons.

Literally whipped by women, Cúchulainn still ends up coming back for more: One of the women who beat him in his dream meets Cúchulainn and introduces herself as Lí Ban. She asks him to help defeat three terrifying enemies in exchange for Lí’s beautiful sister, Fand. He agrees, but is still too weak to make the journey. Emer, Cúchulainn’s wife, comes upon him and in what reads as a moment of masculine pride, scolds him harshly for being weakened by woman love. 19 To this Cúchulainn, in what seems like a complete gender reversal, expresses repentance.

At the end of his life, Cúchulainn is brought down by a woman, or in reality, women. Not only is he hunted and eventually killed at the hands of Queen Medb, but before his final stand, a witch transforms into a crow and flies over Cúchulainn’s head, taunting him with reports of the destruction of Dún Delgan.20 After this episode, Cúchulainn’s consort, Niam, convinces him to leave relative safety and head to the Glen of the Deaf, a valley where the sounds of the attack cannot penetrate. But while they are there, one of Medb’s followers assumes the form of Niam. This imposter, in the shape of a woman (Niam), tells Cúchulainn to leave Emain Macha to save Ulster from Medb’s armies. Deluded, he agrees. It is also a woman, a crone, who precipitates Cúchulainn’s death by helping him violate his geis by eating dog meat.21

The parade of women who stun, trick, manipulate, and abuse Cúchulainn is a long one, which begs the question Why Cúchulainn, why have the manly hero of Ireland so utterly ruined by women? It’s possible that there is nothing special about Cúchulainn’s interactions with women: He sleeps with them, hunts birds for them, and accepts their courtesy even when it means breaching his geis, a sacred taboo. In this view, he is virile, princely, and polite. Viewed another way, he foolish, oversexed, and easily aroused— a victim of the women who surround him, and a victim of his own inability to move beyond these facts.

So who wins? Loki, who embraces the feminine and dies disgraced, or Cúchulainn, who is unable to control the feminine, and dies a hero? However progressive the lives and roles of women and notions of femininity appear to be in Nordic and Celtic societies when compared with other Central European cultures, there remains a strong distinction between what a man should do and how he should act and how a woman should act. Both men die— one a hero, one a villain. Just how much their relationships with the feminine and women had to do with their deaths remains an area of intense discussion.

And although it is tempting to extrapolate these myths and figures to speak for their respective cultures, it would be unfair to generalize two mythic figures as representatives of their age. However, it seems that in both societies— though they were comparatively progressive when it came to women, femininity, and female social roles— the ultimate lesson is that a clear distinction must be made between the sexes, and that with very few exceptions, men must act as men and women as women in these societies. More importantly, power must be maintained no matter what sex a person was.

In the end, these inabilities to deal with women or overcome the feminine led to a loss of power in the myths of Loki and Cúchulainn. In these warrior societies, power was of the utmost importance, and after losing their influence, the demise of both figures was imminent. Though the ultimate distinction between the male and the female still held strong in these myths, that any fluidity of gender roles existed in these societies or their mythology is fascinating— a far cry from the supposedly advanced cultures of the world as we know it today. Nevertheless, an inability to cope with corporeal women, in the case of Cúchulainn, or with the manifestations of the feminine, in the case of Loki, is not favorable in either case, and certainly seems to have played a large part in the myths of both figures, as well in their respective deaths.

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"This Man Loved Earth, Not Heaven, Enough to Die
Death, Imagination, and Reality in Wallace Stevens’ The Man with the Blue Guitar","""We are born to die.""

—SHAKESPEARE, Romeo and Juliet

Wallace Stevens’ The Man with the Blue Guitar has a definite progression and a depth of content that belies its slim thirty-nine pages. The volume has as its focus the imagination, reality, and largely, death, moving from espousal and denial of Stevens’ beliefs to affirmation and acceptance. Interestingly, when the volume is viewed as an evolution of thought, in some ways it resembles parts of the Kübler-Ross (or ‘Five Stage’) model of dealing with death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance being present sometimes in order, and at other times, out of order.1 Granted that this model wasn’t formally espoused until 1969, these stages were almost certainly universal long before they were given a name. In The Man with the Blue Guitar, Stevens writes about his vision of the end of our lives, and of his own life. Studying this volume allows one to consider how death fits into his work as a whole, straddling escapism and reality. Death can neither be escaped nor easily dealt with in reality, which makes Stevens’ willingness to discuss it even more interesting. Though all poets age and inevitably die, perhaps only a poet like Stevens, who started out on his poetic journey late in life, could write with such resonance and portent on the topic of death. The core of much of Stevens’ works, especially his later poems, resides in the liminal space between the imagined and the actual, between escapism and reality. The Man with the Blue Guitar designates death as the supreme reality, for which Stevens had a secular answer: the supreme fiction of poetry.

Before delving into the volume The Man with the Blue Guitar itself, it is helpful to Consider some of Stevens’ other writing outside of his poetry, most of which is extremely illuminating when it comes to his vision of art, as well as his vision of death. While some have described Stevens as self-effacing2, a wealth of is available to study in conjunction with his poetical works. In The Nobel Rider and the Sound of Words, originally given as a lecture at Princeton in 1942, Stevens discusses at length, among other things, the dialectic between imagination and reality. Reality is life and life is society and the imagination and reality; that is to say, the imagination and reality are inseparable, he writes. 3 In writing these words, Stevens not only propounds his theories, but also refutes the theories of others who had written that poetry, in general, is escapist in nature. If life does indeed consist of society and the imagination and reality, then any poetry written, any work brought forth by the act of living (in other words, all poetry) is rooted in reality and necessarily not escapist at all.

It is at this junction that Stevens introduces his belief that while poetry is not an explicitly social or moral tool, it is an art form that can benefit mankind. The poet’s function in society, in his view, is to make his imagination theirs, and to fulfill himself only as he sees his imagination become the light in the minds of others. His role in short, is to help people to live their lives. 4 This act of helping people to live their lives is abstract, and takes many forms, one of which, as we will see, is the acceptance of death as inevitability and secular worship of the world as it is.

Poetry can also protect: Near the end of the piece, in a sentence that could easily have been an axiom, he writes, It is a violence from within that protects us from a violence without. 5 We will see in The Men That Are Falling as well as in A Thought Revolved that Stevens offers poetry as just this kind of interior ferocity that has the power to protect mankind from external strife.

Stevens’ aphorisms, taken from his personal notebooks and written throughout the 1930s and 40s, are also revealing. While some certainly have a sense of humor to accompany their insight (Poetry is a pheasant, etc.) others are extraordinarily succinct and brilliant in their summation of Stevens’ views. After one has abandoned a belief in god, poetry is that essence which takes its place as life’s redemption, he writes in one such maxim.6 Another aphorism in the same vein reads, It is the belief and not the god that counts. 7 And as Stevens’ aphorisms sought to imbue belief and instruct, so too does his poetry— each poem like a missal found, as he writes in the first lines of The Man with the Blue Guitar. 8

From the opening lines of The Man with the Blue Guitar, the musical quality of the poem is apparent. The piece, consisting of thirty-three sets of rhymed or unrhymed couplets, begins like a song and ends like a sermon, moving from a melodious introduction to a beautiful if austere set of beliefs. The entire poem functions on a kind of theme-variation-theme structure, which is also evident from the beginning. The man bent over his guitar, / A shearsman of sorts. The day was green. // They said, 'You have a blue guitar, / You do not play things as they are…'  the piece begins, And they said to him, ‘But play, you must, / A tune beyond us, yet ourselves, // A tune upon the blue guitar, / Of things exactly as they are.' 9 The repetition of phrases such as things as they are and the constant expectation of play, you must makes the opening of this long poem sound like a song or a lullaby for the old and weary.

It is a convention of the theater that when a character is too moved to speak, he sings, and When he is too moved to sing, he dances.10 When considered in this context, it seems fitting that Stevens’ The Man with the Blue Guitar is rooted in a musical metaphor: By using the guitar and the song as vehicles for his views on the imagination, reality, and even death, Stevens lends a further dimension to the piece, couching his beliefs in the form of a guitarist, or guitarist-poet’s, song.

The speaker in this poem admits that he cannot bring the world quite round / Although I patch it as I can, setting up the rest of the piece as an attempt to bring the world and indeed the reader around to his view of things as they are. 12 In the fourth section of the poem, the guitarist-poet already begins to address the grip of denial, in the line So that’s life, then: things as they are? He chafes at the thought of A million people on one string? / And all their manner in the thing… 12 He seems to wonder, can this really be it? Are we all, then, consigned to the same fate? Are we all in this together? In the fifth set of couplets, Stevens attempts to apply a salve to the wound he has rent in human consciousness by declaring that there is no God. He writes Poetry // Exceeding music must take the place / Of empty heaven and its hymns. 13 In place of religion, there is poetry, which while it does not offer everlasting life, does offer, in some ways, provisional life: an appreciation of things as they are, of the secular world and its absurdities as well as its glories. For those skeptical of this displacement of God, in the sixth set of couplets, Stevens writes that if the worship of poetry seems strange and mercurial, it should be compared with the alternative, for The thinking of god is smoky dew. 14

The poem slowly moves closer and closer to the figure of death itself after this point. Along the way, in section eleven, Stevens notes that Slowly the ivy on the stones / Becomes the stones. Women become // The cities, children become the fields / And men in waves become the sea. 15 The world of men, who created God, is crumbling in the face of immutable nature, the earth being the only worthy object of worship in this godless view. Then, in section twenty-three, Stevens unleashes half a dozen haunting, beautiful lines about the actual act of dying. The grunted breath serene and final / The imagined and the real, thought // And the truth, Dichtung und Warheit, all / Confusion solved, as in a refrain // One keeps on playing year by year, / Concerning the nature of things as they are.

We are assured here, again, that the dying breath is a final one, that nothing exists beyond death, and that man has no choice but to keep playing year by year, pretending that death will not come, though he knows that it will. But more importantly, in the actual moment of death, the imagined and the real, Dichtung and Wahrheit (Poetry and Truth), are finally reconciled. It seems, for Stevens, then, that life occurs entirely in the widening and narrowing gap between the real and the imagined, and that death is the full closing of the space between them. The tone of these lines, though they discuss death, is neither fearful nor brave. It is instead final and bare. The impersonal voice advances Stevens desire to speak universally, but it also shields him from disturbing self-exposure.16

In Owl’s Clover, the next piece in the volume, we see more examples of nonbelievers of Stevens’ system. In the second part of the poem, the sculptor of the horses sees more than his muddy hands in their manes, and more than his mind in the wings, but is left with just that: his hands and his mind.17 He reaches for sublimity, for a divinity that simply is not there. The last sentence, broken over two lines, The rotten leaves / Swirled round them in immense autumnal sounds, paints a desperate picture of the sculpture, dreaming of the heavens and yet surrounded only by the material, the rotten leaves of death.

The woman who then enters the poem is equally lost, and is alternately described as unmoved, tortured, and destitute. Stevens writes that Wings / And light lay deeper for her than sight, 18 wings and light being heavenly, angelic images that the woman clings to despite her sight, what the world has to offer, the way things are. The poem also culls from the everyday and harvests its imagery to create something elegiac in nature. What I tried to do in OWL’S CLOVER, Stevens wrote in a letter to Ben Belitt, was to dip aspects of the contemporaneous in the poetic. 19 We see, as Joseph Riddel writes in The Clairvoyant Eye, that Owl’s Clover is concerned, at its root, with the opposition that Stevens would later explore further in The Man with the Blue Guitar: the opposition between things as they are and things as they are imagined.20 In a way, this dichotomy is tantamount to the opposition between reality and death and imagination and heaven.

This emphasis of things as they are and the one true reality of earth does not automatically spell despair and doom for Stevens— there is still beauty here on earth, for the short time we are here. It is true that the world moves from waste / To waste, out of the hopeless waste of the past / Into a hopeful waste to come, yet even where this wreckage lies, some portentous lustres, shades and shapes / Of rose exist, color being a favorite method of Stevens’ for expressing the good, the joyful, and the living. Though death is final, Stevens does not seem unhappy at the prospect of a secular existence. Certainly, in Imagination as Value, Stevens expressed his desire to see the earth exalted in poetry, as heaven and hell are, when he commented that the great poem of the earth remains to be written. 21

This kind of joy in the secular, possible only once an understanding of the finality and reality of death has been achieved, is discussed in A Thought Revolved. True, the poet is Happy rather than holy, but he is nevertheless happy-high, singing not hymns praising God but instead hymns of the struggle of the idea of god, not spiritual hymns but hymns of The middling beast, the garden of paradise / And he that created the garden and peopled it, which is to say, man. Repeatedly in this poem, Stevens writes of an earthly leader and the fact that there is no god but man / Of men whose heaven is in themselves. It is clear from this piece, that what is to be feared is not death, but a death before [men] die, a race that sings and weeps and knows not why. 22

Unlike the woman who appears before the sculptor in Owl’s Clover, we find in A Thought Revolved a woman who is not blind to the reality and finality of death, who bows before the enormity and importance of the imagination. The opening image of A Thought Revolved is an old woman dying of diabetes whose useless bracelets fondly fluttered. We are told that The idea of god no longer sputtered / At the roots of her indifferent curls. 23 Stevens chooses his words carefully here: The lady’s bracelets are useless, her curls indifferent, indicating that while she is not afraid of death, as we will see, she understands the duality of the fact that she must cling to the secular, though the secular is essentially, finally, as meaningless as life is.

We also learn that to this lady, It seemed serener just to die… // Accompanied by the exegesis / Of familiar things in a cheerful voice. 24 As the poem travels from despair to joy, Stevens moves from the negative images of diabetes, lesser dithyrambs and useless bracelets to images of the floweriest barge, a cheerful voice, and the night before Christmas and all the carols. This first section ends with the lines, Dying lady, rejoice, rejoice! This line would seem too glib or too silly had it not been preceded the first two poems in the volume, which outline Stevens as a champion of the secular, a poet less afraid of death than of a life whose pleasures remain unacknowledged.

If men are not to fear death, then what are they to fear? To this also Stevens seems to have an answer in the form of the final poem in the volume, The Men That Are Falling. The poem is intimately linked to Owl’s Clover in its discussion of the fate of the poet in times of danger.25 The Men That Are Falling is a penetrating reflection on war. In a letter to Bernard Heringman, Stevens wrote that he did have the Spanish Republicans in mind when I wrote The Men that are Falling. 26 The cruelty of man toward his fellow man, perhaps, is to be feared and avoided in death’s stead. Those who set their store by God and all angels are possibly to be evaded as well.

The subject of the poem is a man alone in a room at night, unable to sleep, plagued by visions of The head of one of the men that are falling, placed / Upon [his] pillow to repose and speak. 27 But we are made aware that the man whose head lies on the pillow is not to be pitied, for he loved earth, not heaven, enough to die. The terror of the real, here, is catastrophic and frightening, but not to be shied away from.28

This last poem in the volume The Man with the Blue Guitar ends with the phrase life’s voluble utterance, a secular, humanistic image. There is no need to reiterate what has already been said throughout the volume— instead Stevens ends his majestic series with a strong image that speaks for the entire work. His diction is precise, for he does not write merely of life’s utterance or of life’s reticent utterance. His view of life is positive, and life’s utterances are voluble, garrulous and bountiful. Life has much to say, it seems, and also, much to give and teach us.

Perhaps David Perkins illustrates the issue best when he writes— referencing Stevens’ mountainous coiffures of Bath from the poem Le Monocle de Mon Oncle— that Perhaps [for Stevens] religion is a hairdo. It was a myth that humanized the facts of man’s situation and fate. The facts never changed essentially, he proposes, but the myth did and must. 29 If Stevens believed that poetry could help people live their lives, then the looming specter of death was the ultimate challenge to a society (and indeed a poet) that did not or could not believe in God, particularly in turbulent times. He was the mythmaker, the creator of something that man could conceivably believe in when faced with death, or even, with life.

Though Stevens surely did not seem trouble himself (at least from what we can observe) over whether or not his message was accepted and understood, reading some passages of his poetry feels strangely like intercepting an augury from beyond the grave. Perhaps it is Stevens’ maintenance of an impersonal tone even during the most personal of confessions, or perhaps it is the finality of his words, so many of which read like his aphorisms, but whatever the cause, the last two lines of section thirty-one in The Man with the Blue Guitar, It must be this rhapsody or none, / The rhapsody of things as they are seem so portentous that they might have been a fitting ending to The Man with the Blue Guitar, or to the volume as a whole.

Stevens maintains that the poet-guitarist’s song, his rhapsody, is the absolute truth, and that this truth must be accepted or none may be accepted. In other words, this is the truth, as he sees it. While he may not have subscribed to religious dogma, this was his secular version of dogma, his credo that places death at the intersection of reality and imagination.30 For Stevens, imagination and reality are a set, a pair of ideas or instances that are impossible to separate: He wrote in a letter to Hi Simons in August of 1940 that reality = the imagination, and the imagination = reality. 31 These two spheres feed off one another, exist primarily in relation to one another.

In the case of death, the supreme endpoint of reality, the only tonic is what Stevens’ referred to as the supreme fiction, 32 that is, poetry, which, like God, has the ability to bring hope and comfort to man though he may be aware that both are born of the imagination. As Stevens writes in Adagia, The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly. 33 No one knows exactly what man experiences at the moment of his own demise— perhaps Wallace Stevens himself experienced the transcendent moment of unity between imagination and reality when he passed away in 1955. Whatever the case, the meditative, intellectual poetry that he left behind espouses a way of thinking that accomplishes the goal he spoke of so frequently, of to help people to live their lives. When faced with the emptiness of the heavens, Stevens’ poetry did not crumble under its own pointlessness— instead, it turned to champion the earth, the secular, and all that is mankind in its fleeting moment of consciousness.",0,0,0,0.42,18286
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Rejecting Colonial Memory,"It is clear that a collective historical memory, which in this case refers to more of an accepted global or national notion of what happened in the past, is an integral part of society's notion of its place in time. Yet it is not valid to take this historical memory as the only existent form of history. Writers across the world strive to uncover and in some cases retain the history that, as Walter Benjamin might say, present rulers step over (Illuminations, 256). It may remain in the memory of the few, but still seem absent from the collective historical memory. Authors can choose different media to shed more light on lost aspects of the past that have been forgotten or removed. In the specific category, although it may be a problematic one, of post-colonial fiction impressive attempts to indicate lost histories can be found. This attempts maybe in relation to a specific history that the author may be trying to revive or in other cases, the author may simply try to bring to light the fact that histories may be lost in general. Two authors that bring these ideas out through their allusions, symbols and description are Derek Walcott and Michael Ondaatje. In their works, specifically Omeros and The English Patient, contain well constructed points that can be interpreted to shed some light on the loss or at least the obstruction of historical memory. In another vain, it could be argued that these authors are trying to recreate a memory that they think has been lost. Both works use allusions, characters, and specific examples to highlight the way in which colonialism has stepped over the collective memory or history of those they colonize.

In Ondaatje’s The English Patient, the character Kip creates an interesting subject to discuss the attempt to include the memories and histories of colonized places. One of the interesting ways in which this happens is through the transformation of Kip’s name. Although this happens later in the book through a flashback, it brings out a curious way of thinking about the relationship between the colony and the colonizer. First, it must be noted that the temporal setting of the book is important. During the time of World War II, India was still a colony of the British Empire. This point must be made, because some may argue that Ondaatje does not have any particular reason for the situation of Kip, and is merely reflecting the time in which the book is placed. But it must be made clear that this is almost undoubtedly not the case. As a writer who is a part of the colonial experience, one cannot take his writing just as a piece of historical fiction. The devolution of Kip’s name from Kirpal Singh shows brings light to one way in which the colonizer slowly covers up a colonies collective memory. The first notion of this is that as soon and the flashback of Kip’s time in England begins, he is no longer referred to as Kip, but as Kirpal Singh (Ondaatje 181). This is significant, because before this point, there was only one mention of Kip’s full name, and it was only in passing. It is almost as if the author is using the name to mark the transformation of the man. The flashback begins with the use of Kirpal Singh, and it seems that instantly the author is discussing a different person. Kirpal Singh stood where the horse’s saddle would have lain across its back (181). Also, in first parts of the flashback, there are references to Kip by his last name. Ondaatje makes the point that this is not the Kip that the reader has gotten to know previously in the book. It is then made fully clear at the end of the flash back when, Kip “hears Miss Morden’s voice. ‘There is a change in Kip throughout his time in England. In the same passing tone that his full name was brought up at the beginning of the book, Kip’s name is lost. The voice of his skeptical brother is all but forgotten in favor of Lord Suffolk, who has befriended Kip. By transforming a name, Ondaatje shows how colonial powers can facilitate the loss of a collective memory, and slowly start to replace it with their own notion of collective memory. Losing the last name is especially important. In many ways, the loss of the last name shows a loss not only of his family, but in a more far reaching way, his Sikh culture. Although the author is using a personal memory situation, using a loss of culture in the example points clearly to a collective loss of memory. At this point in the book, the realization of loss is not as clear, but Ondaatje plants the seed of what would later be a full realization of the way the colony has lost some of its collective memory.

Towards the end of The English Patient Kip’s tenuous relationship with his colonizer is exposed for what it is, and Ondaatje uses historical events to make trigger his indictment on colonial powers. As Kip hears of the atomic bomb blasts on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all the experiences of British imposed memory and learning seem to be of no consequence, and the memory of his native history is restored. Anger boils to the surface of the usually collected Kip and Ondaatje brings to light the conflict between the memory of the colonized and the colonizer. When Kip begins to comprehend the new events, he immediately confronts the English Patient: I grew up with traditions from my country, but later, more often, from your country (Ondaatje 283). The author could not be more obvious in bringing to light how Kip's own memory has been sacrificed for that of the power of the British Empire. He uses the colonial era to describe issues that are now relevant in the post-colonial era. Kip goes further talking about how there was an element of fear behind the way in which the Indian man was changed in some way to accept the British version of memory. Memory is not always just history, but the memory of customs, the memory of a way of life. Further making this point, Kip says, Indian soldiers wasted their lives as heroes so they could be pukkah (Ondaatje 283). Pukkah here is to mean something along the lines of authentic. The point made is that Indians gave up their lives, their potential to contribute to their Indian collective memory, because they had been indoctrinated into thinking that the British historical cause was the more important. An extra point to be made from this passage is the use of a Hindi word. It is interesting that Ondaatje uses a non-English word without feeling the need to define it anyway. Could this word be seen as an attempt to show that the use of a colonial tongue is just as valid as English? Assuming that a very small portion of the books audience speaks Hindi, it could be argues that the author is bring attention to the fact that he no longer thinks that colonial languages should be relegated to the memory and should be revived again in modern writing. Taken together, Kip's conflicting relationship with the country that colonized his India shows how Britain has in many ways, through the colonial experience, suppressed the collective memory of India.

Derek Walcott is another author that uses fiction to discuss the notions of the loss of collective memory. Most intriguing is one way in which Walcott chooses to highlight this, taking the project one step further and try reviving a sense of collective memory of former colonies. The tool used is myth, using a tool that extends the memory of a civilization long after it has passed to create recall a memory that was lost prematurely. Omeros plays on the myths of Homer, which have lasted thousands of years, and places them in the colonial St. Lucia. In doing so, Walcott creates a way to work inside the frame of thinking that colonial rule has created but still recall the unique memory that each colony has lost. It is critical that authors try to work within the system, because a majority of these writers are products of this colonizer-colonized system. The characters of Major Plunkett and Maud in Omeros, almost play a role like that of Friday in Robinson Crusoe. A parallel can be drawn between the two. Friday is an image of what the majority of the colonial power structure felt of those people they colonized and controlled. On the reverse of this, in Omeros, Plunkett is an image of what the colonial people think of colonial power. One purpose of including these characters is what can be considered an attempt to revive a lost memory, is to include why the memory was stepped over. Walcott understand that the colonial experience has become apart of that collective memory and must also be included in addition to the revival of the old. The best way to assert ideas is to insure that the opposition, in this case, the colonizing power, is aware of the points that are being raised. Walcott creates parallels with Greek myth that draw importance to the common memory of the colonized fisher folk. One such example is when the narrator asks, when would I not hear the Trojan War in two fishermen cursing in Ma Kilman's shop? (Walcott 270) Creating a dialog between lasting memories of myth and lost memory helps revive it. The work is filled with such examples, but this is what makes the work so effective. The close intermingling of the average colonial life with the epic stories with which many readers will be familiar makes the forgotten memory as if it had never been lost. This allusion is another tool that Walcott uses in the revival of the importance to the St. Lucia collective memory. Authors such as Walcott seem to consider myth as a way in which memory stays alive. Linking a lost collective memory to it gives it new light in a unique form that is memorable.

Recalling a collective memory that has not been allowed to flourish is a difficult task. Fiction provides a medium that can at once draw attention to the lost historical memory and in some ways, revive it. Walcott and Ondaatje have found ways to incorporate the revival of memory stepped over by colonial powers. It is important to also remember that these authors come out of a combination colonial and post-colonial era, which brings out some specific characteristics in their writing. First, they have a greater understanding of how to meld two different types of traditions and further, they understand as well not to throw one out in favor of the other. Each colony/colonizer pair are apart of the collective memory of the other, and the acceptance of this fact is a key to the revival of the colony's faded memory. Second, it has given them a variety of issues specific to their homeland in which to emphasize in the voice of a person educated at the 'colonial center'. Of course they discuss multiple issues in their novels, but there is something to say about multiple authors from somewhat similar experiences address a common issue. Those readers who find truth in what they learn must understand that they also have an opportunity to reclaim an identity, a memory and a history that might have been lost or partially glazed over in the past by the colonial experience. Kip found the realization that he no longer had to strive to be pukkah, and in some ways embraced himself and the memory of his people again.",0,0,12.95,5.47,11135
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Deborah and the Degradation of Israel,"Throughout the Book of Judges, women play a significant role in showing the degradation of morality in Israel. When men do not come forward to stop those harming Israel, a certain woman kills the devious Abimelech with a stone, Jael defeats Canannite military leader Sisera with a tent peg, and Deborah the prophetess effectively succeeds in bringing Israel to war against the Canaanites. The text contrasts strong, obedient women with men who the authors represent as reluctant and less courageous in following the moral path to help the Israelites – qualities that are parallel to the deterioration of Israel as the Book develops. An analysis of Deborah’s time as a judge offers insight into the complex representation of women in Judges.

The narrator depicts Deborah as strong, wise and obedient. The text’s presentation of Deborah juxtaposed with that of Barak emphasizes the lack of confidence and courage in the male leader’s actions. It is Deborah who requests that Barak meet Jabin’s army, an act that shows her desire for freedom for the Israelites. In Judges 4:8, Barak requests Deborah’s company and assistance: If you will go with me, I will go. Deborah’s offering to go with him shows selflessness along with an unlikely boldness for her gender and time. At the time of battle, her commands to Barak further the unexpected behavior of a woman – instead of the typical, passive behavior, Deborah’s character takes control and Barak merely follows her instruction. Barak as the male figure, on the other hand, seems reluctant and uneasy about the battle. With the woman’s support, Barak achieves in destroying the army of Sisera. It is evident that without Deborah going up with him – however this could be interpreted – Barak may not have been so successful. It is interesting that Deborah comforts Barak by saying, The LORD is indeed going out before you. It suggests a comparison of the comfort the two figures provide.

Deborah’s prophetess allows her the ability to foresee events that other judges could not. In her assurance of Barak, she warns him that he will not gain the glory from defeating the Canaanites: …nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. (Jud. 4:9) In the passage, the text depicts Deborah’s words as reassuring verses threatening. The authors make Deborah appear as admirable in her ability ot persuade Barak to act.

It is interesting that Deborah is defined as being the wife of her husband rather than her origins, her place of residency, or who she descends from: At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel(Jud. 4:4). The text does not present Deborah as the daughter of anyone; the reader does not know what her roots are and cannot follow the layers of her decent – here, Deborah is only defined as a wife. While the song later refers to her as a mother, it is interesting that this strong leader is not more clearly associated with an Israelite past. It is one detail that sets Deborah apart from the other judges, and again emphasizes her courage in a powerful role.

From the first passage of her introduction, the setting of Deborah’s judgment also sets her apart from the other judges: She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment (Jud. 4:5). Deborah sits in a protective setting, under the shade of a palm, which could either be interpreted as her need for protection as a female or the approachability a counselor with this casual office– versus one set in Jerusalem – might suggest. Deborah makes herself public, accessible. Another significant detail is that the palm sits between the Ramah and Bethel in the hills of Ephraim. Israelites travel from both areas to receive her guidance. Ephraim as a geographical point between the two cities could imply Deborah’s unifying of the Israelite people in the text. Another explanation for Deborah’s setting could be that her prophetess makes her different from the other judges who physically go out to reach their people, making her advice more valuable.

Along with other disparities between Deborah and the male judges, Deborah’s femininity could also contribute to her effective leadership. In Judges 5,Deborah and Barak sing, The peasantry prospered in Israel, they grew fat on plunder, because you arose, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel(Jud. 5:7). The text’s referral to Deborah as a mother highlights her femininity and the author’s positive portrayal of the use of the feminine power. According to the text and outcome of the war, the Israelites were able to prosper and rejoice. The song recalls poetry and the expressive, typically joyous songs of the text, exemplifying the success during Deborah’s time as a judge. The language of Barak’s timid quote referenced earlier is distinctive amidst the surrounding prose. If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go. The parallel, poetic verse expresses Barak’s insecurity.

The reason Deborah, as a female, is a judge is not explained in the text. Other stories in the Book of Judges, however, can help analyze the situation to generate possible reasons for her position. Jael, for instance, is an unlikely hero, especially relative to Deborah. Prior to murdering Sisera, Jael plays an insignificant role in society – she is a wife, and not much else; she is not even an Israelite. Jael uses her femininity and hospitality, however – the two traits she is likely accustomed to as Heber’s wife – to lure Sisera into her home to kill him. Instead of directly confronting him in a way she would most likely fail, Jael waits until he is resting, tired, vulnerable. She goes softly to Sisera, an adjective that hints to Jael’s femininity and an aspect of Jael that possibly makes the defeat of Sisera successful. Before, no man in Barak’s army succeeds in defeating Sisera. From Jael’s story, the text could imply that Deborah rose to judgment when no man was willing.

Another certain woman’s actions mimic those of Jael’s. In Judges 9:53, a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and crushed his skull. In this, the text further shows the decline of male leadership, or leadership in general, in Israel. The text deems it appropriate that a woman and a stone stopped Abimelech, the man who killed all of his brothers to gain power. The text does not provide much information about this woman, but the two stories of a female striking a male in the head with a similarly unconventional object are undeniably similar. It also stresses the independence of Jael and the certain woman in both actions – the text describes no cohorts in either scene. After no men have taken the chance to kill either Sisera or Abimelech – none of the men in the war with neither Sisera’s army nor any of the men at the tower in Thebez. It was the woman in both situations that stepped forward to act in what the text says is Adoshem’s punishment for the crimes Sisera and Abimelech committed, making these instances analogous to Deborah’s situation. The men remain in the background, passively following commands of those they fear.

The text also uses women to further show the immorality of Israel. While Jael killed an enemy, the certain woman rid Israelites of one of their own. Abimelech was, whether appropriately or not, a leader. After killing all but one of his seventy half brothers, Abimelech gains his leadership. It is the unknown, certain woman who the text presents as courageous enough to murder him. Again, although the authors do not write it directly, the passage about this woman could suggest one reason that Deborah is a judge.

The role of women in the Book of Judges is crucial to its representation of the downward moral and religious state. A thorough look at the relationship between Deborah and Barak offers a potential understanding of the text’s portrayal of other women throughout the book. Female roles emphasize inadequate representations of male characters. Deborah was judge at the Canaanites, for example, but it cannot be certain why she was a judge. Passages in Judges, such as the housewife Jael killing Sisera rather than a male or the certain woman killing Abimelech before another man, suggest that Deborah rose judge Israel when no male was willing.",0,0,0,0,8403
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Carwin and the Imp: Perversity and Atmosphere in Wieland,"In one of his famous short stories, Edgar Allen Poe defined perverseness as the completion of an action for the reason that it should not be done.1 The spirit that motivates this type of action is therefore known as the imp of the perverse, and its presence can be found in the works of other authors as well. One predecessor of Poe’s who made use of the idea of the imp of the perverse was Charles Brockden Brown in his novel Wieland. A person motivated by the imp of the perverse is inherently asocial and amoral, and Brown’s character of Carwin the biloquist is certainly both. His irresponsible choices and decision to continue using his biloquism lead to the creation of an irrational, anarchic atmosphere which both influences Wieland’s violence and has a lasting, powerful effect on the reader.

By the time he enters the story, Carwin is already well versed and in control of his gift. Early in life, he made this powerful engine subservient to the supply of my wants, and the gratification of my vanity and exercised it with more or less success (Brown, 227). Force of habit and temptation encourage Carwin to use his ventriloquism the first two times that the Wieland family thinks they are hearing mysterious voices (Brown, 228-9). The language he uses when telling Clara his story proves that Carwin knew his actions were wrong but also that he does not want to take the blame for what he did. His path seemed irrevocable, his actions mechanical, and the impulse that led him on infatuation (239-40). These attempts at shaking off guilt fall especially flat near the end of the story, when Carwin seeks some retreat in the wilderness and then escapes to his brother’s farm in the bosom of a fertile desert, near the sources of the Leheigh (242-4). Had Carwin bothered to do this earlier rather than giving in to the temptation to stay, the story may have ended quite differently. His attempt to shift blame to outside forces prove that Carwin knew his actions were wrong. This knowledge, coupled with the fact that Carwin continued to use his gift and interfere with the family as the story, proves that he was indeed motivated by Poe’s imp of the perverse: he knows what he should do and does exactly the opposite, simply because he can.

Carwin’s relationship with Poe’s imp of the perverse is also reflected in his behavior to the Wieland family. By the time he enters their social circle, he has intimate knowledge of all of them because of his affair with Judith. He knows the small size of their family circle, the mysterious death of the elder Wieland, as well as the strange incidents which had just taken place. Rather than leave the family alone after using his gift the first two times, he enters their company and proceeds to offer opinions on the recent incidents. This decision to contribute to the family discussion about the mysterious voices is extremely perverse, as is the fact that he basically explains to the family how he tricked them with ventriloquism by professing a belief in a human agent attached to the voices (85). By aligning himself with Pleyel, he knows that he is encouraging Wieland to hold even more firmly to his belief in celestial interference, as that is how the family discussions always seem to work out, as Judith would have undoubtedly explained (85). Instead of legitimizing and perhaps helping to moderate Wieland’s belief in God, Carwin uses his knowledge of family dynamics and puts Wieland in the minority among the group and pushing him towards religious extremism.

Besides affecting Wieland, Carwin creates an atmosphere that negatively influences the relationship between Pleyel and Clara. His interference in this quarter seems especially motivated by the imp of the perverse, for he correctly guesses at their affection for one another and then takes steps to separate them. Carwin’s overall interest in Clara appears perverse: he knows that she has feelings for another man and yet continues in a kind of intellectual pursuit. His fascination with Clara begins with Judith’s testimony of her perfections and his meeting with Pleyel is staged to allow direct intercourse with Clara (230-4). His infiltration of the house then allows him to find and read Clara’s private diary, a violation of her personal privacy and of all social codes.

It is in his deception of Pleyel, however, that Carwin is at his most amoral. Though Carwin could tell that Pleyel was a devoted lover, his vanity is tempted at the chance to convince Pleyel of Clara’s infidelity (239). By convincing the logical Pleyel that Clara is having an affair with him, Carwin experiences the sweetest triumph he had ever enjoyed (239). While Carwin attempts to justify this victory as momentary, the very fact that he was tempted to deceive Pleyel and tear the potential couple apart was a blow at their happiness and social mores (239). Carwin’s guilt after this incident and his long night of conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets prove that he knew what he was doing was wrong the whole time but had chosen to act anyway, defining his interference as perverse.

The role that Carwin plays in the murders is questionable, but his real evil in the story is the creation of a certain mood which encourages Wieland to violence. Rather than the rational debate and discourse which rule the family before Carwin’s illicit arrival, the atmosphere after the voices occur is unstable and irrational. The religious mania which occupied the elder Wieland begins to take hold in his son, most likely because of the unexplainable voice actually cased by Carwin. Religion is Wieland’s way of dealing with the mysterious voice, and his assumption that God is speaking to him when it is actually Carwin leads Wieland down a dangerous path. The voice (Carwin) builds validity, first speaking a warning about the temple and later telling the family that Clara is unconscious outside of their door. When the voice warns Pleyel that his fiancé is dead in Europe well before he receives official news of it, it seems that it must be God speaking when it was just Carwin making a lucky guess. His interference in this conversation is especially amoral: he is well hidden in the temple and speaks out in a very private conversation simply because he can and because he knows he should not. The association of the voice with God proves deadly to Wieland’s family, and Carwin’s failure to step forward and acknowledge his antisocial behavior makes him culpable for aiding Wieland’s mania.

Brown’s portrayal of Carwin as fitting Poe’s later definition of perverse makes Wieland a more powerful novel and helps it to have a much greater effect on the reader. By the time Carwin’s confession comes near the end of the story, any reader familiar with Gothic tradition expects some account of a wrong done by an ancestral Wieland to Carwin’s family. Gothic novels tend to relate stories of a father’s or grandfather’s sins being passed down to a current generation, who must pay for past mistakes. Brown does not take this path and this departure from convention helps make Wieland so memorable.

In the end, Carwin has no real motive at all: he sees that he can have power over the family by the use of biloquism and proceeds to effectively ruin their lives by creating an irrational and unexplainable atmosphere that negatively influences Wieland. Carwin’s education, which is evident to Clara and the rest of the family when they meet him, means that he was probably somewhat aware of social norms, but chose willfully not to follow them. This lack of motive haunts the reader, for though Clara blames herself at the end of the story for not being gifted with ordinary equanimity or foresight, if Carwin had no motive then there was no effective way that he could have been stopped. The pointlessness of Carwin’s actions and the subsequent death of Wieland’s wife and children are harder for the reader to deal with than a simple motive, making Wieland even more powerful.

Wieland was written in a different age and by a far different author than The Imp of the Perverse, yet Poe’s definition holds true for Brown’s creation. The idea that a person would do something simply because they know they should not do it can seem petty when practiced on a small scale, but when practiced as a type of lifestyle it can drastically affect the lives of those around the perverse person. Carwin is an essentially amoral, antisocial character who recognizes the rules of society and knows what should be done, as evidenced by his attempt to shift all blame from himself, but refuses to do it. His interference in the lives of the Wieland family leads to the creation of an illogical, disordered atmosphere which leads Wieland to turn to the religious mania of his father in an attempt to explain the universe and which almost breaks apart the relationship between Clara and Pleyel. The fact that Carwin does these things simply because he can and because he is not supposed to added to his lack of any traditional motive makes the story more memorable and powerful for the reader.",0,0,0,0,9082
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Self Destruction in Kindred,"Self mutilation and self destruction serve many roles in Octavia Butler’s Kindred. They show the ties that Rufus, Dana, and Alice all have to one another. Although Butler uses three different characters who experience self destruction and mutilation in different ways with a different meaning for each character, this theme of destruction contains an overarching message for the audience and society as a whole. As a human species, we are all related, with an average 0.03% difference in genetic makeup between the most seemingly different individuals (Kottak 1997). Thus, when human beings hurt each other, they are hurting themselves much like Dana is physically and emotionally hurt when she hurts her ancestor, Rufus. Butler uses physical destruction to represent the physical and emotional destruction of racism on society as a whole, not just the minority victims.

The theme of loss is introduced when the novel begins with Dana losing her arm. By killing Rufus, her ancestor, Dana has lost him as well as her connection to him. By losing her connection to her ancestor, she is also losing her control over history. She cannot return to the past anymore because Rufus is not there to call her. Therefore, she loses the ability exert her modern influence on the past. She is given this control by Rufus whenever he is in danger- she is entrusted with the responsibility to save his life whenever he is in trouble. The destruction of this tie to her relative as well as control over her past takes a physical manifestation in the loss of her arm. When she loses him, she also loses a part of herself. I moved my head, tried to look at the empty place… the stump (Butler 10). Here Dana describes her loss as an empty place, something physically missing from her. When she struggles to free her arm from the wall, it reminisces how she struggled to free herself from Rufus- his control over her while she was in the past as well as her obligation to keep returning to the past to help him. Her arm was stuck into the wall, much the same way she was stuck with trying to help Rufus. The theme of loss plays an important role in the novel. When Dana kills Rufus, this represents the ultimate loss of control. She cannot control him physically, and has lost the ability to reason with him and persuade him to do what is right. She also cannot control herself, unable to stop herself from killing her ancestor.

In addition to a physical self-destruction, Dana emotionally self-destructs when she is in the past. She in a sense becomes a victim of the times, letting the racist attitudes of the past affect her. What had I done wrong? Why was I still slave to a man who had repaid me for saving his life by nearly killing me. Why had I taken yet another beating (Butler 177). In this passage, Dana doesn’t understand the changes on her values and motivations for decision making. Her values are from a different time, and do not coincide with the values of those in the past that she is visiting; they do not fit in there because they are molded by the society she came from. Likewise, the Weylins’ values are molded by the society they came from. As a result of her spending so much time in the past, and trying to behave in a socially accepted manner to avoid beatings, she accepts things that she would not have accepted while she was back at home, such as taking the beating in the passage described above. Once he had told Rufus in my presence, ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself! A nigger can read better than you!’ (Butler 102). She learns not to respond to derogatory remarks about her color, intelligence, or place at the plantation to save herself from beatings, as well as to maintain the confidence of the Weylins, who she needs to protect her.

As Rufus’s guardian, Dana is responsible for the well-being of the Weylin’s only son and protects from fatal harm while she is there. Even though this is true, Dana still feels poorly treated by the Weylin family. In spite of the abuse she feels like she is taking, she still has compassion for Rufus. She becomes a victim of her concern for him, and is very naive when it comes to assessing his character and predicting his actions. I would have all I could do to look after myself. But I would help him as best I could. And I would try to keep friendship with him, maybe plant a few ideas in his mind hat would help both me and the people who would be his slaves for years to come (Butler 68). Here, Dana thinks that she can change Rufus's world view to that of a modern day man. She is blinded by the fact that this man is her ancestor, when in truth he would not hesitate to hurt her as evidenced by the passage where Dana and Kevin try to leave the Weylin plantation.

You’re not leaving! he shouted. He sort of crouched around the gun, clearly on the verge of firing. ""Damn you, you’re not leaving me!"" He was going to shoot. I had pushed him too far. I was Alice all over again, rejecting him. Terrified in spite of myself, I dove past the mare’s head, not caring how I fell as long as I put something between myself and the rifle (Butler 188).

Here Dana has pushed him too far. It is shown that Dana does not have as much control over Rufus as she thought she did prior to this incident. Although she was terrified that Rufus would shoot her or Kevin, she put herself in danger to exert some control over Rufus by defying what he wanted. This form of self destruction served as resistance to Rufus’s control over her as well as the mindset of white superiority in 1819.

Rufus’ own self-destructive behavior signifies his dependence on Dana. She comes to save him every time he is hurt; she represents security for him. Every time he feels insecure, he has her to call on. Despite his careless behavior, including setting his bedroom drapes on fire and falling from a tree, he can always count on Dana to save him if he is in danger. A white man’s dependence on a black woman is an unusual theme to take place in 1819.

The boy was literally growing up as I watched- growing up because I watched and because I helped to keep him safe. I was the worst possible guardian for him- a black to watch over him in a society that considered blacks subhuman, a woman to watch over him in a society that considered women perennial children. I would have all I could do to look after myself. But I would help him as best I could. And I would try to keep friendship with him, maybe plant a few ideas in his mind hat would help both me and the people who would be his slaves for years to come (Butler 68).

Here, Butler shows the reader that although Dana’s travel through time helps her ancestor, it is at great risk to herself. Dana recognizes that this is because she is black, and blacks were treated as subhuman during this time. Because she is black, Rufus feels as if he should be the one helping her, not the other way around. He resents her because this difference in status is accompanied by a power differential. Dana saves Rufus’s life, teaches him how to read, and serves as his protector. He takes his anger out on her when his father dies, even though he knows it was not her fault and that she tried to save him.

“'Dana?’

‘What?’

‘I know you tried to help Daddy. I know.’

‘Then why did you send me to the field? Why did I have to go through all that, Rufe?’

He shrugged, winced, rubbed his shoulders. He still had plenty of sore muscles, apparently. ‘I guess I just had to make somebody pay’” (Butler 216).

However, by punishing Dana he is punishing himself as well through her. The relationship between Dana and Rufus is like a tug of war; what Rufus takes away from Dana he takes for himself. However, whenever he hurts Dana he later suffers himself when the rope is pulled the other way and Dana benefits.

Rufus tries to control Dana through his punishment, which he thinks he should be able to do to a black woman in 1819, but ultimately fails. While he may gain short term victories, he loses everything in the end. This represents his loss of self-control. Since Dana is his ancestor, she is merely an extension of him. He cannot control her any more than he can control his temper, his emotions, or his tendency to get himself into much more trouble than he can handle. It is obvious that Dana cannot control Rufus as a black woman who is assumed to be his slave, but Rufus cannot have complete control over Dana either. Rufus’s lack of control over Dana is subtle in the beginning of the novel, but becomes more apparent as the novel goes on. The ultimate loss of control comes when he attempts to rape Dana. He believes that he is entitled to whatever he wants, including Dana. However, Rufus’s attempt at the ultimate betrayal of Dana’s trust shows just how much of an equal and opposite relationship the two characters have. When Rufus betrays Dana, she wins the battle for the moment by killing her ancestor. However, since they depend so much on each other for their own existence, when Dana loses Rufus, she also loses a part of herself. This takes a physical manifestation in the loss of her arm. The closeness between these two characters takes on a sexual meaning for Rufus. Although he technically owns Dana in the past, he cannot make her love him, any more than he can make Alice love him.

Even though he claims to love Alice, Rufus insists on controlling every aspect of her life, and Alice resents him for this. Rufus’s desperation for Alice to accept him is taken too far when he pretends to sell their children. By doing this he pushes her too far. This is similar to the incident where Rufus threatened to shoot Dana and Kevin when she tried to leave. Here Dana pushed Rufus too far, where Rufus pushes Alice too far when he convinces her that he sold their children. Here the theme of self destruction is evident. Each of these three characters represents parts of a whole- a family. By hurting one member, everyone suffers, in essence hurting oneself by hurting one part of the whole. Alice’s suicide plays a dual role. It represents self-destruction, as she physically destroys herself, and forces her children to grow up without a mother (although she thinks this has already happened). In addition, it serves as an extreme form of resistance to Rufus’s control over her. Her death is severe punishment for Rufus, and further confirmation that he would never have Alice, much in the same way that he could not have Dana.

The dynamic relationship between Dana, Rufus, and Alice represents different extensions of the same whole. They are all essential for each others’ survival, and show dependence on one another. When the relationship between any of the three characters is harmed, one or all of the characters are often physically hurt. This takes the form of both self mutilation and self destruction. One character can most painfully hurt the others by hurting himself/herself. This is shown by Alice’s suicide, as well as when Dana kills Rufus. Both of these examples also show the complete loss of self control. Each character knows that he/she will also hurt himself/herself, either physically, emotionally, or both, by hurting one of the others that they are so closely related to. The struggle for control over oneself, others, and history are prevalent themes in the novel. Butler uses destruction to represent the detrimental effects of racism, both physical and emotional, on everyone involved.",0,0,9.39,12.93,11415
English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Illustrations in Persepolis,"When I first flipped through Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, I was very confused why it had been assigned for my Literature class. I thought students were supposed to read Literature, not looked at pictures of it. Unable to understand why this picture book was assigned for a college class rather than a third grade class, I began reading; maybe I could figure out why. After a closer reading, I saw that the book deals with the complex political and social history of Iran, and would not be fully understood or appreciated by a third grader. Satrapi’s personal struggle with her own identity is a significant theme as well, which many college students can relate to. I believe that Satrapi, as an artist, found a fantastic way to represent her life story with frames containing both pictures and words. This style works well for her particular story. Pictures can be used to express emotions and feelings that cannot be done by words alone. The graphics add substance to the book rather than take away from its complexity or its meaning. While some may argue that the use of graphics is a way to dumb the book down, they function as a way to communicate ideas in a different way, which in the case of Persepolis is very effective.

Nima Naghibi, one critic who has examined the graphics in this novel, sees this method of writing as a means of resistance to the Iranian regime. Since she looks at the form of the text itself, Naghibi can be considered a Formalist critic. Satrapi stresses throughout the book that her family is progressive and their views westernized. Her parents participate in demonstrations against the oppressive regime; the rebel in whatever ways they can without getting arrested. Their way of dress: her father’s tie, shirt tucked in, and no beard and her mother’s hair peeking through her veil are both acts of resistance (Persepolis I 75). In addition to the resistance shown within the book, the book itself in its graphic form is a sign of resistance. The graphic novel format itself is western, and would therefore be considered controversial by the regime. Many western readers still consider graphic novels the way the Greeks once saw prose—as a good story, but not as Literature. Eastern readers consider this even more controversial than in the west. It was also unusual and discouraged for women to write autobiographies, as autobiographical stories have been perceived as a form of metaphorical unveiling as indecorous as physical unveiling (Naghibi 224). As a female, a child, and a person who is not a member of the government, it is politically unacceptable for Satrapi to be the one who tells Americans the story of Iran’s political history and present state. The form of the book itself as a graphic autobiography is a sign of rebellion.

Another Formalist critic, Theresa Tensuan, like Nagini believes that the narrative persona of Satrapi’s Persepolis literally as well as figuratively question the social codes and communal assumptions that engender limited and limiting roles and establish specific parameters in which these roles can be enacted (Tensuan 954). Coming from a culture where one can’t speak his/her views without fear of execution, it seems natural for Satrapi to draw her story. As a child she saw many of the terrible things that happened in her country, but could not openly express her feelings about what she saw in words without fear of punishment. However, she often expressed her feelings by her actions, such as participating in demonstrations and letting the front of her hair show through her veil, wearing sneakers, a jean jacket, jeans, and a Michael Jackson button from Spain (Persepolis I 133). She also continuously wore jewelry after her principal told her not to, and even hit the principal (Persepolis I 143). These actions show that the safest way to rebel was by actions, not words, although even these could get her in trouble. Unable to openly speak out, she had these visual images in her mind, unable to speak about them anyplace but her own home. This is another statement she could be making by using graphic form.

As Satrapi’s memory of her childhood is both in mental pictures and words, the book’s use of a combination of the two is more accurate and true to the original source. By using a combination of narration and dialogue, she is presenting a story and leaving the value judgments to the reader. She shows you what she remembers, and then you decide what to make of her perceptions.
 Persepolis cues the reader to closely attend to the ways in which her perception of the work is inflicted by strategic misrepresentations, a systemic lack of information, and active acts of interpretation—elements that are constantly at play when one tries to establish what bell hooks has defined as an oppositional gaze  (Tensuan 956).
It is obvious to the reader that these are Marjane’s perceptions, because she is a child telling the story. She speaks in very concise, short sentences the way a child would. Her drawings allow the reader to go inside her mind, such as the picture of her indecision about the veil. Half of her is wearing the veil and half is not, torn between her religious and her revolutionary sides (Persepolis I 6). She presents her story through the pictures in her mind.

The use of graphics allows an honesty that cannot be expressed by words alone. She is revealing her experiences to us, not just her thoughts. It would be one thing to say that the veil was oppressive. As the book was first written in French, Satrapi’s intended audience is a western one. The view of the veil as oppressive is a common viewpoint in western society, and is not really that startling of a point to describe. Satrapi’s physical depiction of the veil, however, shows this in a way that words cannot express. The fundamentalist woman shown on page 75 is completely covered by her veil, as only her face shows (Persepolis I). Everywhere that Marjane is shown wearing the veil, it is drawn very rigidly; it constricts her image, and symbolically constricts her life. It is exaggerated in size and covers most of her upper body, showing the significance of this change in her life, of being obligated to wear the veil. Her scarf is bigger and seems to be more repressive than other girls’ scarves (Persepolis II 127). In the class photo, the girls seem to be wearing nothing except for the veil—it completely dominates the picture (Persepolis I 3). Similarly, the veil begins to dominate her life. Satrapi points out that women became more concerned with getting arrested for their appearances than asking themselves Where is my freedom of thought? Where is my freedom of speech? My life, is it livable? What’s going on in the political prisons? (Persepolis II 148). The fear of the regime not only physically suppresses them with the veil, but emotionally as well, distracting them from their thoughts of liberty and replacing these thoughts with fear for their safety and the safely of loved ones. This depiction of domination makes it more apparent when it is shown, rather than told.

Tensuan looks at the way graphics add to the novel’s meaning in a way that words cannot. I’m particularly interested in the ways in which comics help us see how particular narrative conventions and visual idioms work to enscript our critical perspectives and purviews (Tensuan 951). An example of the way in which visuals work in ways that words cannot can be found on page 150 where Satrapi uses images to represent the repressed feelings of the people behind the walls: joy, laughter, sexuality, dancing, having fun, vanity, music, etc. These ideas are too numerous to list without losing the reader’s attention. However, this visual image is much more aesthetically pleasing than a list of words. It truly captures the reader’s attention because it is beautiful—this draws the reader in and entices them to consider the richness of life behind the walls (Persepolis II 150). In addition, the group of women as shown in public in veils and long dresses is contrasted with an image of the same women in private. The difference is striking. Everyone looks the same in the first picture, but in the second different hair colors and styles are apparent, three of the girls are wearing lipstick (a sign of rebellion), low cut tops and jewelry. The east and west contrast is apparent in these photos as well—the familiar and the unfamiliar images to the western reader.

Satrapi’s use of images to tell her story often draws upon other common images already known by the reader. This visual connection between her images and images from the reader’s own social memory is more effective than trying to connect a written image to a visual one.
In the opening pages of Persepolis, Satrapi draws an image of her mother demonstrating in the streets as an act of protest against the rise of the regime that took power after the deposal of the Shah. Satrapi’s rendition of her mother chanting and raising a fist is based on a picture captured by a German photographer and printed in newspapers across Europe; the photo becomes a point of pride for the young Marji who is constantly gauging the heroism of members of her family in relation to the exploits, sacrifices, and sufferings of her classmates’ kin. In casting her mother as an icon of heroic resistance, Marji could be aligned with readers of or of the who would be cued to see Taji Satrapi as an emblematic representation of individual resistance, communal movements, and democratic progress (Tensuan 957).
If the reader is familiar with the particular photo Satrapi references here, the comparison is much more striking as a visual comparison than a written one, since the source is also graphic.

A third critic, Gillian Whitlock, makes the Marxist argument that Satrapi’s choice of graphic form is to get her message out to as many different people as possible.
Part of the power of comics is that this mediation occurs now across cultures in a global network of sequential art. Although there are distinctive and readily identified national and cultural traditions of comics… the vocabulary and grammar of comics are widely accessible and adaptable (Whitlock 969).

The division of language, and even culture, can be overcome through drawings. Coming from a revolutionary family, Marjane wants change for her country and the way it is viewed. You are going to shut up or I am going to make you! I am Iranian and proud of it! (Persepolis II 43). The size of the text in this frame are the largest anywhere in the book, emphasizing that in this one instance her words are more important than her drawing. She wants her message to be heard so badly that she stood up to a group of kids from school when Iran was the epitome of evil and being Iranian was a heavy burden to bear (Persepolis II 41). The drawings in the novel are a way to get this message out to more people. That a person from Iraq, Iran’s enemy for years, was able to see many similarities between Marjane and himself gives this form even more of a potential to impact others.

It is too scary how much we have in common, Iraqis and Iranians I mean… Some of the things about the start of the Muslim revolution make me think about what is happening right now in Iraq… I had the urge to start translating it and throwing copies of it on the streets of Baghdad. Why can’t we learn from other peoples’ mistakes? (Salam Pax qtd. in Whitlock 969).

This strong reaction from a rival country made me see just how wide of an impact this book can have. Because it is easily translatable, Satrapi’s story and message can easily reach mass amounts of people. Part of the power of comics is that this mediation occurs now across cultures in a global network of sequential art… the vocabulary and grammar of comics are widely accessible and adaptable (Whitlock 969). This is truly a revolutionary work.

The way Satrapi draws people in the book gives political comments with each image. The background is black throughout most of the novel, representing oppression of the evil Iranian regime. The people in the novel are the only source of light, which she uses to represent goodness. On p. 21, the Iranian and Iraqi leaders’ bodies are drawn in black, while their background is white, a reversal of her normal color scheme in the book to show how she felt about the leaders (Persepolis I). In addition, Satrapi’s choice to draw in comic-style fragments, rather than one picture per page, is a conscious choice that is worth examining as well. The panels of comics fracture both time and space (Whitlock 970). This allows the reader to see her world as fragmented, or incomplete—there is clearly a problem in her country. According to Whitlock, dehumanizing the frame of reference that mediated representations of veiled women (974) makes the oppression seem worse than it already appears to the reader. The regime is making not only cruel, but inhumane impositions on the life of Iranian women. The way the frames work is not always apparent the first time reading the novel, but becomes apparent upon rereading.

Marjane’s unconventional style of communicating her story definitely forces the reader to read actively. With both words and pictures, the reader has a lot to pay attention to if he/she is to fully appreciate the book. The specific demands comics makes on the reader to produce closure – the work of observing the parts but perceiving the whole…comics require the reader to become a collaborator, engaging in an active process of working through (Whitlock 970).

English,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Central Message of Chaucer’s Retraction,"The length and the abstractness of Chaucer’s Retractioncan be deceiving and misleading, it can potentially lead readers to believe that the Chaucer’s retraction is trivial and insignificant. The strong religious references may even deter the reader from exploring further. And because the text is disconnected and isolated from other tales and other parts of The Canterbury Tale, people can even treat it like the unfinished Cook’s Tale. One of the most vital messages of The Canterbury Tales is hidden in Chaucer’s Retraction: Since Geoffrey Chaucer possess the awareness and honesty like the Pardoner, he has the guts to confess his sins. And his intention is not to just confess his sin or ask for his own forgiveness, but he hints that the readers should also ask for the mercy of God to forgive their sins.

The identity of speaker, Chaucer, is central to the meaning of the retraction. In this passage of Chaucer’s Retraction, And if ther be any thyng that displea-se hem, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unknnynge and nat to my wyl (1082-1083, Chaucer’s Retraction). Chaucer asserts that anything that offends the reader should be imputed to his lack of ability and not to his will. Here, it is the second time that Chaucer has made the similar type of claim in The Canterbury Tales. In Chaucer’s Tale of Sir Topas, the Host interrupts Chaucer’s tedious tale by saying Namoore of this, for Goddes dignittee,/ for thou makest me/So weryof thy verray lewednesse (906, Sir Thopas). Chaucer responds with Why so? Why wiltow lette me. / Moore of my tale than another man/ Syn that it is the beste tale I kan (926-928, Sir Thopas). Chaucer claims that he has told the story the best of his ability, the beste tale I kan.

Ironically, no one in the history of the literature would doubt Chaucer’s ability to compose poetry with complex ideas. The readers are fully aware that Chaucer has the ability to tell a magnificent and profound tale. Is Chaucer lying? What is important to point out is that we must distinguish the author Chaucer and the character Chaucer in the poem. They are completely different people: the author, Geoffrey Chaucer is unquestionably one of the greatest English author and poet of all time. He is the first author to finish his masterpiece in the vernacular English language. The reason why we are still reading Chaucer’s text today is because the greatness and the inherited values and ideas embedded in this rich text.

On the other hand, the character Chaucer in the book is a completely different character. He is a story teller, and he tells the worst tales among all pilgrims. In The Tale of Sir Topas, each stanza is intentionally filled up with clichés and absurdities. This is a symbolic move on Geoffrey Chaucer’s part. The character Chaucer is a representation of writers, especially the writers who do not have the skill to compose fresh rhymes or innovative thoughts, who continue to write clichés and conventional expressions. Those writers are precisely who Geoffrey Chaucer criticizes and makes fun of because there is no profound literal value or an attempt to solve social problems. In contrast, Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales is precisely the opposite: the tales resembles an entire society, high and low, male and female, old and young, Christian or pagan, educated or ignorant, town and country. They are certainly amusing tales to read on the surface, but the political implication and social satire under the surface are why The Canterbury Tales stands out from all other books.

The author Geoffrey Chaucer mocks the character Chaucer and his conventional writing. It is clear to see what kind of literature Geoffrey Chaucer admires or what kind of author that he despises. In lines 1084-1085 of Chaucer’s Retraction, Wherefore I biseke yow mekely, for the mercy of God, that ye preye for me that Crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes;/ and namely of my translacions and enditynges of worly vanitees, the whiche I revoke in my retractiouns, It is evident that speaker is not the same untalented storyteller Chaucer as in The Tale of Sir Topas or The Tale of Melibee. Apparently, Geoffrey Chaucer, the author is the speaker of the retraction because he confesses that he is the author who translates and edits all previous tales, the translacions and enditynges of worly vanitees.

The main purpose of his retraction is intended to preye for me that Ctrist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes. But what is Geoffrey Chaucer guilty of? He is merely a writer exposing all worly vanitees. Why does Chaucer beg for God’s forgiveness? In Chaucer’s Retraction, he says, as is the book of Troilus; the book of the Duchesse; the book of Seint Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes; the tales of Caunterbury, thilke that sownen into synne (1086-1090). According to the notes in Larry Benson’s edition, sownen into synne means tend toward, are conductive to, sin (310). The implication of his previous quotation is that all his writings and previous books are tend toward, are conductive to, sin. But if Chaucer wants to confess to God and ask for his own forgiveness, he can easily burn all his books that he thought are most sinful. If he plays it safe with God, it is not necessary to publically explain his sin to all his readers at the end of the book.

The end of the book is usually reserved for conclusions or the imperative points that the readers can extract from the whole book. But why does Geoffrey Chaucer choose to include his confession at the end and let his audience read it? What does he want the readers to gain from the end of his book?

From his action of letting the revocation stand in the same book with the poems that sownen into synne, we can detect an important message that Chaucer attempts to send to us readers. The key idea is that Geoffrey Chaucer’s intention is not to ask God to forgivehimself and to repent his sins. Instead he asks God to forgive the sinful characters that he has created and also to forgive the sinful readers.

Geoffrey Chaucer is as not sinful as the Pardoner or those corrupted pilgrims and dishonored characters in his poem. The pilgrims have all committed sin when they took part in this pilgrimage, not for spiritual or religious reasons, but for maken ernest of game (3186, The Miller’s Prologue). They attend the pilgrimage for social interactions and selfish pursuits. They embody sinful individuality that battles with religion.

The Pardoner is perhaps the most corrupted and the most sinful character in the poem. In his prologue, he frankly confesses that he is a fraud motivated by greed, gluttony and avarice and that he is guilty of all seven sins. Even though he is essentially a hypocrite in his profession, he is at least being honest as he makes his confession. On the other hand, although other pilgrims are also guilty of sins as well like the Pardoner, they don’t admit their sins or make confessions like the Pardoner. The role of the Pardoner in the story is to get men to call on God for forgiveness of their sins. Interestingly, Chaucer’s role in the retraction is extremely similar to Pardoner’s, he calls on God for forgiveness of his sins; he also calls on God for forgiveness of the pilgrims’ sins. Chaucer is similar to the Pardoner in a way that they both share the unique awareness of their own sin whereas the pilgrims and the readers do not.

Theoretically, the author, Geoffrey Chaucer has a full control of all the characters in his book. He could have made every character virtuous and perfect, like the verrayu, parfit, gentil knight. If every pilgrim behaves like the Knight and if there is no sin committed, there would be no need to ask for forgiveness in Chaucer’s Retraction. But Geoffrey Chaucer does not have the power to do that, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unknnoynge and nat to my wyl, that wolde ful fayn have seyd better if I hadde had konnynge (1082-1083, Chaucer’s Retraction). This passage implies that if Chaucer has had the power, the konnynge, he would easily have written better, and he would have easily create all virtuous characters and the world would be perfect and beautiful. But what kind of power or konnynge does he refer to? And since no one would have doubted on Chaucer’s literal talent or poetic ability—he obviously has the literal power. So what power or konnynge does he lack in this context?

Chaucer has his choice to make his characters virtuous or sinful. But to realistically reflect the human reality and the social condition of life, sin is an inevitable and inseparable part of humanity. Chaucer has no power and therefore no konnynge to control his characters from committing sins if he accurately portrays his characters from the fourteenth century society. Even in The Knight’s Tale, arguably the most moral story about love, honor, chivalry and adventure, Arcite and Palamon are also embodiments of sins such as anger, jealousy, violence and injustice upon closely examination. From the original sin of Adam and Eve, to Radix malorum est cupidatis, the sins are basic elements of human lives and all of us have committed a sin in our life time.

In Geoffrey Chaucer’s opinion, other authors of the Medieval literature have often only created moralizing and unrealistic characters. In contrast, he makes most of the characters realistically sinful. Most of the characters are nothing like the Knight. Why doesn’t he just create moralizing characters and tell noble stories? After Knight’s noble story, why does the Miller jump in and break the pattern of social status, telling a vulgar and sinful story?

In The Miller’s Prologue, when the Reeve objects Miller’s tale because he was once a carpenter, this story seems potentially vulgar and immoral because Miller is very drunk and everyone knows that he would not tell a tale of nobility like the Knight. This is a purposeful interruption and a critical turning point of the poem created by Geoffrey Chaucer. At that moment, Chaucer’s response is the following:

Of yvel entente, but for I moot reherce
Hir tales alle, be they better or werse,

Or ells falsen som of my mateere.

And therefore, whoso list it nat yheere,

Turne over the leef and chese another tale;

For he shal fynde ynowe, grete and smale,

Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse, (3173-3179, The Miller’s Prologue)

Chaucer says that he is merely here to retell the story. When he asks the reader to turne over the leef and cheses another tale; For he shal fynde ynowe, grete and smale, Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse, his intention is precisely the opposite. He invokes readers’ curiosity to read further into The Milller’s Tale. Furthermore, for the readers who have read all the tales, we know that there is no grete and smale tales that toucheth gentillesse even if the reader skips the Miller’s Tale. The tale after The Miller’s Tale is The Reeve’s Tale, which is much more vulgar and offensive. What Chaucer encourages is exactly the opposite of skipping the sinful stories, but to read all the vulgar tales and accept the reality, hoping the readers will see their own sins while reading.

Why does Chaucer predict the readers may want to skip the vulgar or the sinful tales? It is also a very important question that Chaucer poses for the readers. We, the readers, like the pilgrims in the Canterbury Tales, most likely would not confess our sin and only laugh at others. The readers are mostly likely not going to identify with the sins that Chaucer reveals in his poem. However, it is reality that the readers all have committed many similar sins from the book. The readers are just as sinful as the pilgrims. However, the readers do not possess the awareness or have the guts to confess their sins like Geoffrey Chaucer or like the Pardoner.

The tale before the retraction is The Canterbury Tales, which focuses on abstract virtues and the goal of the pilgrimage: immortality and heaven. The Parson also lists the Seven Deadly Sins: pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lechery. And he directs man toward penitence and confession. Essentially, The Chaucer’s Retraction is parallel with the Parson’s view. It is significant that the first sin of the Seven Deadly Sins is pride, and pride is the arguably the worst form of sins because it could potentially prevent us to see our other sins. The Oxford English Dictionary defines pride as high, esp. an excessively high, opinion of one's own worth or importance which gives rise to a feeling or attitude of superiority over others; inordinate self-esteem. It is precisely the pilgrims’ pride, their sense and attitude of superiority over the Pardoner, preventing them to see their own flaws and sins. It is the readers’ pride, our feeling of superiority over the characters and pilgrims in the book, preventing us to see our own sins in our life.

On one level, the pilgrims merely treat the tales as amusing stories by constantly encouraging each other to tell moral tales. They do not realize their own sins are reflected in the tales that they tell or the tales that they hear. On another level, the readers, including myself, would likely consider this book as amusing. For example, readers may only find The Miller’s Tale to be humorous: the characters are dumb, their farts are ridiculous, and the miller is just a drunken and vulgar man. We may not realize that the fabliaux also happen in our lives and in our contemporary society: many rich old men like the carpenter prefer to marry young and beautiful women; many scholars like Nicholas pursue and desire courtly love.

Essentially, Chaucer, the master of English language, advises us to realize our own sins in our lives after the completion of The Canterbury Tales, which is the central message of the book. Sins exist in everyone regardless of their social rank or different occupations. By looking through the characters’ nobility or aristocracy and looking past readers’ own hypocrisy, we may find our sins, and Chaucer sincerely wishes the readers would follow his act, admit their sins, and ask for God’s mercy and forgiveness.

English,Creative Writing,Undergraduate,My Life Is Not a Movie Starring Michelle Pfeiffer or Hilary Swank,"""What am I supposed to do wit' chu?"" Perched behind her shoddy metal desk, the large Black woman eyed me up and down.

Ignoring the thirty-eight pairs of eyes now glued on me, I contemplated turning around and running out of the classroom. Well – um – I'm actually a teaching intern with the Chicago Public Schools, and I'm just here to observe you, and then – well – teach the class, I responded, pretending that her question had been completely cordial and appropriate. And you're my mentor teacher, I thought. Awesome.

Apparently satisfied with my explanation, Ms. Taylor pointed to a discolored yellow chair next to her desk and told me to have a seat. I sat down and tried to ignore the collective thought bubble that had materialized over the students: Who is this white girl, and what is she doing in our classroom?

* * *

This past September, when my friends asked me about the six weeks I had spent teaching summer school in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), I knew that, in our academic, socially-aware culture, I was supposed to talk about what a wonderful, incredibly rewarding experience it had been. On that first day back in June, however, I encountered nothing wonderful nor rewarding to speak of. To put it bluntly, I had been scared shitless. Not scared of the students themselves, but scared that they wouldn't take me seriously. Scared that I wouldn't be able to get through to them. Scared that I would fail.

After spending two semesters in the University of Michigan's School of Education, I had certainly been in front of a classroom of students before – but never like this. Never had I been faced with the task of teaching a class of thirty-eight students who ranged from grades nine through twelve – all of whom had failed English for one or both semesters of the previous school year. And never, never in all my middle-class suburban experience, had I been exposed to a group of students who lacked even the most miniscule amount of assumed respect for their teacher. Deep breaths, I told myself. You'll get through this. The Eleanor Roosevelt quote my mom always told me surfaced. You must do the thing you think you cannot do.

Summer school at John Hope College Prep High School1 was set up in a way that made it difficult for students to enjoy themselves and learn anything. The students were forced to sit in one classroom for four hours straight save for one ten-minute break. In the stifling heat of the Chicago summer, the air conditioning flickered on and off based on the mood of the construction workers at the school.

And Ms. Taylor, my mentor teacher, certainly did nothing to make the students' time worthwhile. She began each day by writing an agenda (a list of assignments) on the board. By itself, this was not an unusual practice. However, most teachers would generally take the time to go over such an agenda with their students – guiding them through the day's activities, showing the students how their daily work related to overarching classroom goals, and answering questions. Ms. Taylor, on the other hand, felt that her daily agendas were self-explanatory, and so she would remain seated at her desk as the students entered the classroom. If (when) the students did not immediately begin working on the list of assignments, her favored method of classroom management involved yelling (from her desk, of course) motivating phrases like, EXCUSE ME! and YOU BETTER GET THAT WORK DONE!

When the students chose to ignore Ms. Taylor's yelling altogether, the vice principal of the school would treat the students to a forty-minute lecture that would ensure their good behavior until roughly ten minutes after the vice principal had exited the room. At that point, Ms. Taylor would resort back to yelling her signature phrases and reminding the students of the vice principal's meaningless threats to have them thrown out of summer school and held back a year.

It would be easier to place all blame on the students for their behavior if the work they were being asked to complete were actually interesting or enriching. Unfortunately, the work Ms. Taylor demanded of the students consisted of nothing more than piles and piles of unrelated, elementary-level worksheets. After observing the high school students complete a worksheet on street signs one day (yes, you read that correctly – street signs), I began to plan what I thought would be a masterful lesson. I reasoned that the students misbehaved because they were bored. Who wouldn't near the point of death-by-boredom after four hours of inane worksheets? In my lesson, I would incorporate discussion, community-building exercises, literature, and other academically stimulating activities. How could it fail?

My carefully planned-out lesson in hand, I stand in front of the class the following Monday. I decide to begin class with a simple activity in which each student will introduce him or herself and then tell the class something he or she enjoys doing outside of school. This sort of activity, I figure, will allow me to get to know the students a little bit, begin to learn their names, and build community in the classroom. The students eye me warily as I begin to explain the activity and then promptly decide that listening to me or participating in the activity is out of the question. I call on one student to introduce himself and begin the activity, but he cannot be heard over the roar of the classroom, and the students don't bat an eye at my request to quiet down. My mind floods with panic as I try to decide whether or not to proceed with the activity. Shit! I'll look like a fool if I give up after one student. Maybe they'll quiet down if I keep going.

I attempted to continue with my plan, but the classroom was so loud that I couldn't hear each student's introduction unless I approached him or her individually. When I made it halfway through the class, I knew I looked like a complete idiot, but there was no turning back at that point. Right on time, my supervising teacher from my internship program2 arrived to observe my teaching.

My lesson soon dissolved into a pathetic display of Ms. Taylor yelling at the students for misbehaving while I stood lamely by the whiteboard, staring at my shoes. My supervising teacher, LaTina, mercifully led me, after a few minutes of this humiliation, out of the room to discuss my lesson. My eyes filled to the brim with hot tears of shame, and, upon being asked how I felt the lesson had gone, I broke down crying.

If my life were one of those inner-city-school-meets-white-suburban-teacher movies, this would be the point in the movie when I would make a breakthrough with my students and, following the requisite heartwarming movie montage, become the best teacher ever, send all my students to college, and even save a few lives in the meantime. However, my life did not follow this cookie-cutter plot structure this past summer, and I learned that the silver screen had failed in capturing what it truly means to be an effective teacher in an inner-city school.

I would be lying if I claimed to have had a breakthrough moment with my students, but, if nothing else, I was persistent. After that first awful day of teaching, the vice principal gave me the chance to spend my six weeks in another classroom. But, as my gut instinct told me to do at the time, I made the conscious decision to stay in my classroom for the remainder of the summer. My pride as a teacher definitely played a role in this decision, but the main reason I stayed had to do with my desire to prove to my students that (one) they could not scare me off that easily and (two) that I would not give up on them.

And with my persistence (and a few minor threats from the vice principal), my students gradually began to receive my lessons better. By the time three of the six weeks had gone by, I was teaching full-time. At this point, I had come to accept that my mentor was not a person from whom I was going to learn much (except what not to do, that is). Not when her idea of helping me involved declaring to the students, I don't care if she [i.e., me] looks like she's twelve – you still have to listen to her!

Instead of following her method of simply keeping the students busy, I designed a short unit that would focus heavily on the students' writing skills – skills that the students would need in order to successfully obtain a job or attend college. The assignment I gave my students asked them to write about challenges they had faced in their own lives – and if my students were good at anything, they were good at making their private lives public in their writing.

Through journal entries and personal narratives, I learned that my students were dealing with heavier situations than I could have imagined. Some of my students wrote about the pain of having a parent who was addicted to illegal drugs; others recognized the powerful impact the loss of a family member had had on their lives; others reflected on their own experiences in jail or juvenile detention; and still others wrote about the experience of becoming a single teenage parent.

But along with these heartbreaking stories, I also read about students who loved to sing, to dance, to draw, to play sports, to spend time with family and friends, and to attend church. I read about students who were nervous about playing drums in church, and who were trying to keep their grades up so they could play for their school's basketball team. My students' writing made it painfully clear that they were simply normal kids who had been forced to grow up in very difficult situations.

But before this essay starts to sound like a carbon copy of Freedom Writers 3, I must be honest. Despite the wonderful anecdotes my students were sharing with me, each day in that classroom was utterly exhausting. I thought my carefully scaffolded lessons and increasingly positive relationships with my students would eliminate my classroom-management problems, but, unfortunately, I was wrong.

The same students who told me that they had liked having a teacher who actually cared continued to talk while I was talking, continued to ignore the assignments I had asked them to complete, and continued to disrespect me when they didn't like what I had to say. Despite the good I felt I was doing (and I'm embarrassed to admit this), I was counting down the days until I could get out of there – counting down the days until my lexicon would consist of more than the phrases stop talking, sit down, be quiet, pay attention, listen up, and do your assignment.

Indeed, the frustration I felt trying to manage that classroom became unbearable at times. There were many more days after my first lesson that brought me to tears. In fact, on one of my last days in the classroom (to complete a somewhat unfortunate rhetorical circle), a particularly humiliating interaction with a disrespectful student prompted me leave Ms. Taylor to manage the classroom while I took a moment to cry in the privacy of the bathroom.

Reflecting back on my experience teaching summer school in CPS, I have bittersweet feelings. On the one hand, I could not have paid to obtain such an incredible learning experience, and I believe, despite all the challenges I faced, that I had a positive influence on at least a few of my students. On the other hand, however, I am reluctant to return to CPS. Maybe this reluctance makes me a selfish person. After all, if nothing else, my experience working with Ms. Taylor has proven to me just how badly urban schools need quality teachers.

Be that as it may, I believe that students in urban schools (given all the environmental forces such students are up against), need stability too. I realize, at this point in my life, that I don't know myself well enough yet to know whether or not I could withstand such a difficult teaching situation for an extended period of time. I plan to teach in a suburban area after graduation, but my heart and my vote (in terms of educational policy, that is) will always be with my students in Chicago.",0,37.5,35.14,49.23,12068
English,Creative Writing,Undergraduate,Autoethnography,"My eyes shifted between a copy of Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the worn assignment sheet, and the ocean of white on the computer screen in front of me. Hopeless. Why did I take 10th grade honors English when my brain obviously hibernates during the summer months? The words thesis statement loomed forebodingly in bold type. I opened Internet Explorer for a Google search. A few clicks later I found, thesis: a position that is maintained by argument. Alright, that's not an entirely new concept. I read the assignment sheet for the millionth time. My eyes lingered on, consider the following examples. Would using one of the given examples for my paper be encouraged or considered cheating? I leaned back in my swivel chair and sighed, wishing the instructions explicitly told me what my teacher wanted. Honors English already felt overwhelming and I hadn't even started school yet.

The papers I wrote before 10th grade were mostly reports, or essays that were meant to answer specific questions. On multiple occasions I had to do a career study, which entailed researching a profession and regurgitating the facts in my own words. The rubric had a checklist that included specific content requirements, as well as things like paper length, grammatical accuracy, proper use of MLA, and of course, a reminder to put your name and date in the header. In 9th grade English, the goal was to recite the teacher's thoughts about The Importance of Being Earnest by discussing the theme of honesty, or something equally idiotic, while adhering to the five paragraph essay format. These early high school papers were completely uninteresting; there was no need for imaginative thought, only thorough archival notes. However, when I received my summer reading packet for honors English, the freedom of the paper assignments surprised me. It was a new challenge to have to come up with my own paper topic, and state it as a thesis.

With one week left of summer, I couldn't put off writing my Pride and Prejudice paper any longer. After looking at cliff notes for inspiration, I decided that my argument was going to be that Mr. Darcy's mansion, Pemberley, is symbolic of his true character. I only quoted one passage, and wrote the whole paragraph out after my introduction, which used up a sizable portion of the two page length requirement. The body of my paper was similar to a close reading, though I never knew that term in high school. My writing process was plagued by doubt, and the pressure to meet the new higher standards of honors English caused a lot of anxiety. The end result was a wholly unremarkable paper in most respects. It was not the best or worst thing I'd ever written, and it was only one of several English essays I wrote that summer. What makes the Pemberley essay so memorable is that it marked my first attempt at writing the type of paper that is expected at the university level. I had to formulate a thesis and support it with textual evidence without a checklist style rubric to guide me. I also couldn't regurgitate my teacher's ideas; I hadn't even met her yet. For the first time I didn't know what the teacher wanted, so I had to rely on my own creativity. While my writing still lacked a great deal of sophistication, my words were more my own than they had ever been.

Four years later, I found myself flipping through the same copy of Pride and Prejudice. This time I was beginning to write a midterm paper for an introductory literature class at The University of Michigan. The assignment description was long, full of thought provoking quotes and questions. It pointed to different options to consider while still leaving room for interpretation and originality. After reading my professor's provocative prompts, I immediately latched onto the idea of using Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice to discuss the conflict between the desire for autonomy and the pressure to adhere to social norms. A hypothetical outline started taking shape in my head. Surprised by my own inspiration, I tore through my folder to find the handout from Dr. John Gregory's popular conduct book for women. Before I knew it, my fingers were taking over the keyboard and quoting Dr. Gregory to begin my introduction. Other ideas kept pouring out until a very pregnant paragraph dominated the computer screen. When I went back to reread, I found wonderful sentences that joined forces to create an introduction that was mostly incoherent. If only a perfect introduction could be created that quickly! I let myself be frustrated for a brief moment before going in for another attempt.

Three pages, and a couple days later, I still wasn't satisfied with my thesis. The idea was there, but its presentation needed serious revision. I sought my professor during office hours for help. She suggested that I use two sentences to convey my thesis, the first to set up the opposition to my argument, and the second to reject that idea in favor of my own. The concept of framing my thesis with this two pronged approach was foreign to me, but it worked beautifully. I addressed my concerns about passive voice and effective transitions in our meeting, but the only major issue my professor found with my paper was that I had not yet include the required close reading. I left office hours with fresh determination.

For the next few days I agonized over where I could inject a close reading into my paper without disrupting the momentum. No matter what I tried, an effective solution eluded me. The night before it was due, I emailed the semi-polished paper to a friend for feedback. I considered my paper mostly done, though it still lacked the close reading and a conclusion. Forty-five minutes later I received my paper back, covered with red corrections; it was a merciless massacre. Shocked, I began to scrutinize his criticisms, many of which only succeeded in desecrating the voice of my paper. I angrily clicked reject change on more than half of the red insertions or deletions, and began passionately defending my writing to my friend via instant messenger. When my roommate started laughing at my rage, I realized how personal my paper had become. If the close reading doesn't work, why should I compromise an excellent paper to satisfy my professor? The obvious answer would be, to get a good grade, but my pride won out. I turned in my paper without a close reading, and without most of the corrections my well intentioned friend had made for me.

A week later, my professor handed back our papers. I held my breath as I flipped to the back page to see my grade. When I saw the letter A, I let out a semi audible squeal. My professor wrote in her comments that she could not penalize this exceptional paper, as my rebellion against the close reading was in the spirit of my thesis itself. I had never thought of Elizabeth Bennett's struggle for autonomy as analogous to my own, but it was a very clever justification. I left class convinced that I was holding the best writing of my academic career.

Looking back a year later, I wonder if the Pride and Prejudice paper actually marks my best scholastic writing, or if I'm biased because of my deep level of personal investment in the paper. Perhaps both are true and it's that enthusiasm that makes the paper so captivating. Ultimately, what really makes the paper remarkable is that I absolutely refused to compromise any part of my writing, even at the risk of receiving a lower grade. It was a bold choice, certainly not one I would have made in high school.

While writing the 10th grade honors English paper, I was not the only one desperately wishing the teacher had given us a more directive assignment. Bloom captures the collective mindset accurately, 'Just tell me what you want,' our students ask- 'and I'll give it to you in order to get a good grade' (46). High school students are used to receiving specific essay instructions and they grow dependent on them. They know their grade usually relies on presenting the teacher with specific ideas in a specific format. Some classes, such as my honors English class, encourage more independent thought, but too few high school teachers challenge their students in that way.

When beginning any writing assignment, there will always be that first step in which the student must discern what the instructor is asking for, but that does not mean there is always a singular path to achieving it. According to Bloom, only the bold, the hyperconfident, or naïve have the courage to speak for themselves instead of becoming their teachers' ventriloquists (46). While this is likely to be true for high school students, I question the validity of Bloom's statement in the university setting. One of the largest differentiations between high school and college writing seems to be the weight placed on independent thought. For example, my freshman English professor reserved A grades for students who presented original and unique arguments in their papers. Topics discussed in class were fair game, but not eligible for top grades, no matter how well written. The policy pushed freshman to think critically and demonstrated that it was no longer acceptable to simply be the teachers' ventriloquists. Most students were eager to accept this challenge, and easily understood the advantage of creating a paper that stood out from their classmates’. Bloom fails to give university students credit for their intellectual ingenuity.

Both of my Pride and Prejudice papers mark important mile stones in the process of developing a unique voice in my writing. Honors English challenged me to discover a voice that did not imitate my teacher's. It forced me to search beyond regurgitating ideas, though I was only partially successful since cliff notes ended up being the springboard for my argument. In my university Lit class, innovative ideas surfaced quickly, but I struggled with the conflict between adhering to the assignment and writing an uncompromising paper that satisfied my own objective. My choice to risk getting a lower grade demonstrated a deep personal connection to my writing that I had never experienced before. It also exuded an extremely high level of courage, even bold hyperconfidence as Bloom would say. While I hope that in the future I do not find myself in the position to disregard the assignment parameters set by my professors, my goal is to continue making my academic writing my own. I want to push myself to make new and bold choices in my writing that work to advance the never-ending process of developing my individual voice.",0,0,9.13,6.28,10576
English,Creative Writing,Undergraduate,Suomi,"The must of the old farmhouse seared my nostrils with recollections of a visit from long ago. I remembered this place, although more than a decade has passed since I was here last. Memories flashed in my mind of a time when my grandmother was still alive. I only met her once in my life—yet I still remember the only words she ever spoke to me. I was sitting on the lap of this unfamiliar old woman that I knew I was supposed to love, even if I was barely nine years old and utterly terrified of her. My mom stood next to me and translated the foreign but familiar words that spewed from this stranger's mouth. The conversation was awkward and strained. My grandmother yearned to communicate with her youngest grandchildren whom she'd only met in pictures and stories. My little sister, with her big brown eyes, had a look of desperation and anxiety on her face, and I sensed that we shared the same feeling. We wanted to feel warmth for Mumu, but there wasn't tenderness for a stranger we hardly knew. She stroked my hair and patted my arm, then turned to my mother and muttered some indecipherable language. Mumu looked into my eyes as she held me tight on her lap. With all seriousness—for she knew it might be her only opportunity to reassure my sister and me of this—she said it.

I love you. Said Mumu.

I love you too, I replied. But the words came out of my mouth sounding more foreign than Finnish. I barely recognized it as speech. I said this out of habit, much like I would unwittingly reply to a thank you with an automatic you're welcome. Mumu died three years later, before I ever had a chance to tell her how I felt in earnest.

I made my decision to go to Finland in late April of this past year and a month later I found myself on a plane headed across the Atlantic Ocean. I remembered bits and pieces of my prior visit to Finland from when I was eight years old, like playing in the incredible snow drifts near the farmhouse in Iisalmi and creeping through the abandoned barn that once housed cattle but where now only the eerie odor of barnyard animals remained. Last time I'd been there it was dark winter, but this time it was bright summer.

Driving down the highway from the airport to my uncle's house seemed familiar. As a young girl, I can still remember looking up and out the window and seeing the hanging cliffs, remnants of the last ice age, on either side of the road and feeling like I was still in Michigan. Yet now, as a young woman I peered out the car at these ancient walls once again and feelings of the arctic overwhelmed me. The dark and bare cliffs, although no more than thirty feet tall, exuded strength, sagacity, and age. White birch trees dotted the flat terrain, while occasional daring pines desperately clung to life on the cliffs.

Later that day my aunt took me to the Finnish Lotta museum. Named after the woman who started the organizations, the Lottas were female nurses who served in the First and Second World Wars and cared for the wounded Finnish soldiers on the battlefield and in the safe confines of the forest. As we walked through the museum, my aunt asked me questions about the Lottas, seeking to pick my brain of any prior knowledge stored in the recesses of my mind. I had nothing to say to her. I was ashamed to admit that I did not know anything about the history of Finland. She looked disappointed, but her frown soon changed to a grin when we entered the theatre to watch a documentary on the Lottas. But as we sat alone in the darkened room, she turned to me and the look of dissatisfaction returned.

I think it is terrible that Arja did not teach you anything about the history of your country. She did a very bad thing not to teach you girls Finnish. It's selfish, what she did. Her words stung me. I never thought of my mom as being selfish for not teaching me her language. Upon hearing my aunt's comments, my cheeks grew red and I became very angry yet also sad. I didn't feel Finnish anymore. I felt like a phony.

The next day my uncle took me for a car ride through Helsinki. We drove through the entirety of the city in about an hour. Seeing Helsinki from within the confines of a car was surreal. I wanted to breath the Baltic air, smell the scents of the city, hear the sounds of feet pounding the cobblestone roads, and listen to the trams on the lines. But instead, I sat inside the heated car with Bryan Adams in the background, listening to my uncle explain the significance of each place we drove past in his broken English. I stared at the history from behind the glass. We did not get out of the car until he dropped me off to meet my cousins.

On my third day in Finland, my youngest cousin, who is twenty-two, and her friends came to my uncle's house for a night of sauna and drinking. Noora drove up with three of her friends from high school. They brought ciders with them and jovially spoke to one another. It seemed like they were probably reminiscing about old times shared together before they found their separate paths to adulthood. They sat around the kitchen table gesticulating wildly while abrupt bouts of loud laughter filled the air. I sat at the corner seat of the table, smiling uneasily, fidgeting with my drink, staring into my cup. I laughed nervously in accordance with their hearty chuckles, although the sounds I made seemed quite misplaced among their confident banter. After they left to go to the sauna, I went back to the computer and wrote e-mails back home; trying hard to hold back the tears that I knew were coming. Flashbacks of my first and last visit with Mumu whirled in my head—the awkwardness of not saying a thing, the isolation of not understanding anything around me, and the sadness of longing to know my family but always feeling like an outsider.

The feelings of rejection persisted throughout my stay in Finland, including during the trip north that I made with my uncle to my mom's birthplace of Iisalmi. The drive to Iisalmi took two days, as we made a stop in a tiny former railroad town called Haapamaki. We stayed at my cousin Markuu's house with his family. His house was ancient and warm, and it was obvious he and his wife had put a lot of work into remodeling it. The first hour there was petrifying. Once again, I sat on the corner couch and said little to nothing. I'd never met my cousin Markuu before, and to be quite honest, and I didn't know he even existed until we arrived at his inviting house. This was my second time in three days meeting an unknown cousin, an experience which can be quite unpleasant with a language barrier. But Markuu made a sincere effort to welcome me, and took me on a tour of his little town.

I sensed isolation and sadness in Haapamaki—a small old rail town in the middle of Finland—as we drove around in his decade old station wagon. We saw the town theater that was also used as a dance hall on weekdays, the sole schoolhouse that educated kindergartners to adolescents, the single restaurant, and the town square where a bear had caused quite a stir the week before by leaving the forest and parading about the parking lot. He drove me to a secluded area of the town and that is where I saw the humor in where he lived. There was an entire dwarf village constructed out in the country in this unsuspecting town. Some crazy old man with too much time on his hands had built an entire town suited for hobbits. The dichotomy was confusing—in an old rail ghost town was a vibrant little hobbit village in the midst of its forest. Even though he had seen it probably hundreds of times, we still laughed over the sheer lunacy of this man's life's work.

Later that night as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep, I thought of why my sister and I hadn't been to Finland more often. What was it that my mom was hiding us from? Why did she choose to isolate us from her family? The sheer distance made rare visits understandable, but the fact that she never showed us any pictures or told us any stories about the people from her homeland struck me as odd. I began to side with my aunt in thinking that my mother was incredibly selfish. That night, sleeping in my bed at my cousin's warm house, I became so angry that night at her for cutting us off from our relatives and making it nearly impossible for us to meaningfully communicate with them. I would always be the odd man out in this family. I would never be a part of the talks over dinner, the reminiscing, and the jokes. I was the American cousin whom everyone heard of but never had met.

The next morning a note was left on the table that read Thank you for your visiting here in Haapamaki. It was really nice to meet you both. Have a good time in Iisalmi and wellcome [sic] next time! The usual Finnish breakfast consisting of un-sliced mild farmer's cheese, dark rye bread, tomatoes, pickles, ham, butter, and khavia—or coffee—was left out for us. My uncle Esa and I continued on our way to Iisalmi shortly thereafter.

The drive to Iisalmi seemed like an endless stream of small lakes, towering pines, patches of birch trees, and flat terrain. I knew we were close to my mom's home when we hadn't seen civilization for about an hour. It was peculiar to see the home my mom grew up in. It was such a small house, I couldn't fathom that it had housed ten people at one time. Behind the modest two-story house were two tall pine trees that symmetrically framed the house. Alongside the left of the house was a long one-story barn that now contained motorcycles and cars that my cousin used—ancient tools of a farmer now replaced by the conveniences of modern society. Taking the in scenery was breathtaking yet disturbing—there was no trace of civilization for miles—no people, no houses, no cars, and no buildings as far as the eye could see. Opposite the barn was my grandmother's modest home. It was built for her in the late 1970s after my mom's older brother inherited the farm from his father. Until her death in 1997, my grandmother lived in the tiny house filled with decades old crocheted blankets and embroidered pillows. This is where I would be staying the evening.

Late that night, alone in my dead grandmother's home while everyone else stayed at the main house, I stayed awake well into the morning. The midnight sun was only a month away from its peak, so at two in the morning the sun was just above the horizon. I stared out the window toward the lake that bordered the farmhouse. Looking around the room, I saw all of the signs of my grandmother even though my uncle and his wife had been living in her house for nearly five years. There were paintings on the walls of my cousins, uncles, and aunts. Crosses dotted the walls alongside figures of Christ. Old black and white pictures from a century ago lined the shelf above the headboard, and even when I shut my eyes tightly I could still feel the eyes of my cousins and God burning into me, demanding an answer for my decade long absence.

I was scared out of my wits that night in the Arctic Circle. The darkness never came nor did respite from the thoughts of my dead grandmother and my own mother's past that tormented me. I slept only an hour or two because every time I opened my eyes I thought I caught a glimpse of a shadow or a figure in the corner of the room. I felt my grandmother's spirit all around me—infusing me with the spirit of Finland, telling me that life was going to be okay, and that I belonged here even if I might not feel it in this moment. Looking out the window, I was only comforted by miles of uninhabited plains and an immortal sunset.

I awoke in the morning with no ghost floating above me. My uncle Esa and I left that day since I was scheduled to return to the United States later that week. I was sad to leave the history of the farm, yet also relieved to be leaving the desolation and sadness of this rural life in a place where the veil of night never fully enveloped the summer sky.

I returned home with a desire to learn more about Finland and its culture. Most importantly, I became determined to learn the language and nearly five months later I am just beginning to teach myself Finnish. When my mom found out about my plans to study abroad in Turku (the oldest city in Finland located on the west coast near the Baltic Sea), she sent me a little surprise gift: the first book I ever read in Finnish. The frail little book, covered in bite marks and childish scribbles, was filled with simple renderings of barnyard animals, each with a title underneath the picture. Upon opening the book I discovered a small note scrawled on pink paper that read, Start small and eventually everything else will fall into place. At that moment, I finally let out all the frustrations of my visit to Finland and of my inability to understand my heritage. I wept for a few minutes, and then slowly fell asleep, only to wake up the next morning with no better understanding of my roots.",49.57,34.6,32.96,24.39,12920
English,Creative Writing,Undergraduate,"Hire Me, You Know You Want To","Career Fair 2006, the first step to success. What the career center handbook does not mention is the weeks, even yearlong preparation work before the big day. The engineering honor societies would normally post all the company information online two weeks before the actual career fair in early September each year, to aid engineering students through what most upperclassmen refer to as living hell because of its machine-like elimination process and cruelty. Desperation and depression syndromes are not uncommon among engineering students in the months following because of the impact career fair leaves behind. A friend has once painstakingly described his career fair experience to be a beggar in a suit, and you see these beggars everywhere: dressed in suits from outlet stores; hunched back with heavy backpacks full of engineering books; and beaten harshly by the reality while their eyes scream desperation.

However, for freshman, career fair is practically a shopping spree. One month into college, their resumes are blank while they struggle to calculate an expected GPA. After they face the reality of the market and decide that they are not in any hurry or any competent position in finding an internship or a full-time job, they scurry through suits and ties and high heels while maintain their eye contact perpetually at table level, only to momentarily stop in front of their desired station and collect freebies: from mechanical pencil to stuffed animals to electronic laser tags. Later, they would triumphantly show their despaired upperclassmen their bagful of finds and maybe even spare a toy or two. Little do they know that only a year from now, they would be the ones shinning away from the pepperoni pizza smelled freshman in fear of crumpling and staining their well-ironed shirts.

8:30am, catch the recruiters while their morning coffees are still fresh. Dressed in the more traditional black suit and black leather pumps, I am doing a last minute check in the basement bathroom mirror before I walk up to the Pierpont Duderstat connector on north campus, already crammed with engineering students, waiting patiently inline along the walls to talk to the recruiters. A good candidate knows the importance of keeping composure and presenting themselves even when no one is watching. 1 The recruiters at the engineering career fair are flown in from all over the United States, hired by more than two hundred companies ranging from small consulting firms to big corporations, to recruit the best of the best, namely Michigan graduates.

The competition is still fierce, especially between students of the same major. My friends constantly show their frustration by telling me that they can’t believe the guy sitting quietly besides them in their engineering course interviewed for the same company as them and got an offer while they were turned down. Although that being the downside of career fair, it has always been interesting going to class on the day of, and seeing everyone dressed in their best outfit, mostly new clothes since we are used to jeans and Michigan sweatshirts. Even the guy with funky T-shirt of a baby head had changed into a conservative white dress shirt and a pair of black pants over black shoes. Never ever wear white socks with black shoes and black pants, because they are like flashlights that turn on and off when you are walking. A career center advisor once warned us during a workshop called Making a Good Impression. To stop all the female audience from nudging their male friends and snickering, the advisor said: Ladies, you don’t want to wear too much jewelry. Stick to the basic: no dangling earrings, over-sized necklaces and definitely no rings unless you are engaged or married. I say this not only because it’s very distracting for the recruiters, but also because once I had a girl who wore some really spiky rings on her right hand. Unfortunately she was a bone crasher when it comes to hand shake, and she actually injured the recruiter while shaking hands. I head some grunts and laughs, but also saw some people taking notes religiously. As far as I know, job hunting becomes an obsession as we approach senior year. Even the computer science geek who used to hide in computer labs and program all night long is now eager to talk to Google and Microsoft representatives.

Never chew gum. It makes you produce too much saliva, and you may accidentally spit on the recruiter. Instead, eat mints. Pop a tic-tac in your mouth and chew on it to make the fresh feeling come out quicker. The little secret is that no matter how early in the morning you have to talk to a recruiter, always practice talking before hand either by reading a newspaper, chatting with a friend or even singing to yourself in the shower. This tip may seem trivial right now, but it would prevent you from stumbling over your words, which is very likely to happen when you are nervous and anxious to get a job. However eager you are, remember your goal at the career fair is to get an interviewing opportunity, never to get a job offer.

As mechanical as all these tips may sound, this was how I was taught. I remember clearly the first time I felt the pressure to find a job. The job itself may not be that important, but it’s the start of a chain reaction: your first internship would help you land an even better internship for next summer, and with two internships on hand, you are in good shape in finding the full-time job you’ve always dreamt about when you graduate. It’s a body stretch before you start climbing the corporate ladder, intimidating but real life. Starting from freshman year, it’s all about resume building, work experience. Everything we do seem to end up being that one extra line on our resumes, so that it makes you look worthy to the recruiter you finally get a chance to talk to at the career fair.

So tell me about yourself. It’s not unusual for recruiters to ask interviewing questions during career fair after their find you as a very prominent potential candidate. To reach this step, all you need is a strong resume and a good first expression. The trick here is to be prepared. Elevator talk, an introduction ranging from 10 seconds to 30 seconds about you, mainly used to sell yourself to the executive you meet presumptively in the elevator. Also prepare a longer version of elevator talk in case the imaginary elevator breaks down. Be sure to practice the speech in front of your mirror at home, watch for eye contacts, mouth movements, hand gestures, standing positions and distance. Remember: a) Before you move eagerly to your top priority companies’ stands, practice the speech at your low priority company stands to make sure that you are no longer nervous and are comfortable talking in perhaps the most uncomfortable outfit you own. b) Have your resume ready in your hand, don’t be fishing for it in your book bag on the spot, no one appreciates an unprepared job hunter and a crumpled piece of paper. After shaking hand with the recruiter with your right hand and your resume in your left hand, you ask politely: Would you like to take a look at my resume? Smile. You then use your right hand to offer him/her your resume with the bottom facing him/her. Be confident even if your GPA is on the low side, because it’s definitely not the only factor that comes into play when it’s job hunting.

When I was volunteering as a resume sorter at my past employer’s stand during career fair, I knew there were as many high GPA resumes in the No box as the number of low GPA resumes in the Yes box; both boxes hidden in the secret corners behind the tables and posters. GPA is definitely not the sole indicator of how much you worth in the professional world, in which the concept is a combination of things. You assemble your strengths and even your weaknesses together to present them as a whole, on a sheet of paper, to sell yourself. I was appalled when one of the recruiters hastily handed me my good friend’s resume and told me to toss it in the No box. Not only is his GPA near perfect but also he has devoted most of his time to volunteering. I couldn’t think of anything that’s unattractive about him, maybe his Singaporean accent and short and skinny figure? I couldn’t help but wonder what had made the recruiter decide that he is not worthy. From afar, behind the shoulders of students and recruiters, he was waving and smiling at me, and then giving me a thumb’s up. I smiled back while I stapled his resume with the evaluation sheet and tossed them away with the rest of the unlucky resumes. This kind of things happen all the time, it’s a survival of the fittest. No one is there is there to take your hand while you walk those hallways like a resume distributing machine; no one is there to wipe your tears when a company turns you down; and no one is there to give you a pat on the shoulder when you have to talk to a cold faced recruiter enthusiastically.

To look at the bigger picture, everyone in the engineering school worth approximately the same when we graduate from Michigan with a Bachelor’s degree, although it doesn’t feel the same now since we are still in the same pond. In the end, it all comes down to how well you know yourself, because that determines how well you present yourself. A technical communication professor once told me that he had a student coming to him for help months after graduation because he still couldn’t get a job offer. The professor couldn’t understand why because the student had a perfect 4.0. He had one look at the student’s resume and he saw the problem: the student’s resume was almost blank. He didn’t put in any of the research, work experience, and volunteering he had done because he didn’t think they were important enough to mention, and so he stayed humble and jobless.

Since the beginning of freshman year, I’ve been collecting tips from my own experience, career workshops and even managers themselves on talking to recruiters and doing interviews. After a while, it became a cycle of wanting your resume to look good, so that you are qualified for more things to put on your resume, this in turn makes it look even better, and so on. Like rolling a snowball, it’s always hard to squeeze out that small icy sphere in the beginning, but once you have a medium sized ball, it’s easy to just roll it in the snow and make it even bigger. This is a path most people would end up choosing in life regardless of all the colorful dreams they have had when they just entered college. In the end, we are all dressed up in the same clothes while trying to sell ourselves to the same companies, but with different speeches and resumes. It’s an art, and mastering this art is an unspoken must-learn survival kit before graduation. Job hunting has nothing to do with the real you; successful job hunters are all the same: they are all well dressed, well mannered young professionals who are open-minded extraverts, good at communication, flexible, and positive. They are the live versions of career center handbook, and they are the ones with all the job offers. The cynical guy who once gave me the sarcastic comment of beggar in a suit now has offers from five engineering consulting firms, and three world famous corporations. One company even offered to pay his tuition, but he is a totally different person when he is out of the interviewing room, sad and depressed, anti-social and sullen faced because the process stresses him out so much.

By junior year, I’ve perfected my routine to the point that I can recite my resume and my work experience like my birthday. After all that behavioral interview, case studies, social setting interviews and phone interviews, I know exactly what the recruiters look for and I recognize the spark in their eyes when they find what they are looking for. This doesn’t mean I’ve never failed. Of course I have, and that’s how I learned and excelled.

Normally you can judge can interviewer’s skillfulness by how much emotion he/she shows during an interview. Young interviewers tend to show a lot of personal preferences and emotions, whereas older managers know how to keep the same calm friendly face throughout, not showing even a trace of like or disapprove. During one of my first interviews, I encountered what is often referred to as the silent treatment, where the interviewer waits patiently and silently after you have already finished answering their question. The goal is to see how well you cope with tension and stress. Most inexperienced students would panic and try to add things they did not intent to say initially and thus put themselves at the risk of performing badly. My interviewer asked me to tell him about my last work experience (which is an extremely common question during interviews). I said: I did cash flow, accounting, and customer service. ,Pause, panic, …and then other than that, I didn’t really do much… Half way through my sentence I sensed the subtle twisting of eyebrows on my interviewer’s face, so I panicked even more and tried to make up for my mistake by saying: What I meant was that the job itself didn’t require much anyways (which basically suggested that either it wasn’t an important position, or that it was and I didn’t take it seriously). The subtle hint became an obvious troubled stare, and I knew I screwed up. I learned fairly quickly, and then using what I learned from my last failure to really polish and refine my style so that I can do it even better then next time. The next time I was given the silent treatment, I looked at the interviewer straight in the eye, smiled and told him: So that’s what I did for my last job. I enjoyed it very much, but I think I’m ready to move on.

The interviewer is only human. Sometimes they may be more nervous than you are. I would say this is the key to confidence. Knowing that the interviewer or recruiter you talk to is just another co-worker you’ve worked with in the past; another GSI you’ve had in your class; another person you’ve wheeled pass in Wal-Mart is the key to confidence and being comfortable. It’s an art, I say, to be able to convince someone you are the right candidate without actually selling yourself. You do that by pretending to talk to your interviewer in a casual setting, such as in a restaurant or a classroom. You get them engaged by showing your knowledge and interest in their companies, and then you dive into your own qualities. You should also know your own values and don’t try to appear higher by acting over-confident and don’t try to appear too eager by acting too humble. Finding the right balance can help you to leverage what you have with what you lack, to cover up your weaknesses with your strengths.

I like walking down the hallway in high heels, intentionally making rhythmic thumps with my steps. It boosts my confidence for I know I’m already making a statement. Not afraid of facing all the turning heads, I’m making long eye contacts while keeping my head high and a confident smile on my face. Just like that, I learned to talk to recruiters and do interviews. I’ve also settled myself with two internships so far, and well on my way up the corporate ladder. I am a machine, a well-dressed robot that knows all the dos-and-don’ts, who can camouflage as the type of person most companies want to hire, because I’m just too afraid to walk down the road less traveled by, so I picked the one chosen by most of my precedents.",0,0,0,3.38,15463
English,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,"The Portrayal of Menstruation in Ulysses: Commentary on Sensationalism, Confinement, Realism and Intimacy","Throughout James Joyce's Ulysses, the protagonist, Leopold Bloom confronts and questions depictions of the idealized female form. For example, in one episode he investigates whether or not the statues of nude goddesses at Dublin's National Gallery have all the same orifices that he does. This episode, referenced repeatedly throughout the text, is just one of many attempts to complicate idealization and a culture that neglects to address the totality of the body through frank explorations of bodily realities. One such bodily reality, menstruation, offers a particular form of commentary because of its intimate ties to femininity. The depictions of menstruation throughout the novel are wildly different, from the stifled portrayal of Gerty Macdowell in Nausica, to Gerty's sensational act of exposing her bloody clout in the hallucinatory Circe, to Molly Bloom's frank, realistic frustration in Penelope. But in their own way, all portrayals ironize traditional constructions of femininity, and ask a reader to critically consider a culture that promotes gendered behavior but dismisses bodily realities of sexual difference.

Before we can assess the significance of Gerty's shocking reappearance in Circe, we must first investigate the ways in which Gerty's narrative treatment in Nausica necessitates this type of subversive addendum. In other words, what violence justifies and provokes such sensational resistance? An analysis of the prose style provides insight.

Unlike Joyce's intimate portrayals of Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom as narrated in the first-person, Gerty is narrated in the third person – a style that emphasizes, as opposed to minimizes, distance between reader and character. The third-person narration may also reflect juvenile, self-narrated fantasies of self-importance, suggesting that this is the language of dishonest engagements as opposed to frank confrontations with reality. In this same vein, the prose style also actively suppresses or stifles anything popularly deemed ugly, vulgar or emotionally wild. This suspicious stylistic practice is introduced from the outset of the chapter. The second sentence of the opening paragraph reads, Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth…(284). The sentimental phrase all too fleeting day, simply negates the realities of Bloom's torturous day thus far in a wash of inappropriate cliché. The narrative style's immediate suppression of pain and struggle sets the tone for the chapter.

Similarly, though the line, From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled (299) refers to Gerty, this sentence can also be read as a lens through which to interpret the narrative style. For example, a reader can't help but note the abundance of euphemisms – the outhouse is that place (291), menstruation is that thing (296), and even an article as benign as a toddler's unsoiled diaper is referred to as his unmentionables (285). Indeed, when the content of the narrative even borders on vulgarity, the prose reasserts its control and overcompensates stylistically with euphemism after euphemism.

More disturbingly, the prose style also stifles ugly emotional realities. For example, Gerty's painful account of her father's alcoholism is diffused by prose language that inappropriately sentimentalizes Gerty's situation. For example, the text explains But the vile decoction which has ruined so many heaths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witness in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and has seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely…(290). The content of this narrative is truly painful, but the manner in which it is presented doesn't adequately recognize or address that pain; words like nay and vile decoction are too precious and distractingly exotic to truly capture the ugliness of the situation.

By this point in the novel, a careful reader should realize that this chapter's half-hearted engagement with emotion and the body is suspicious. This prose style is unlike the truthful prose of Bloom, our unconquered hero, (217). A reader must ask: why is Gerty narrated in this manner, to what end? Many argue that the narrative style of Nausica can be read as Joyce's portrait of a young Dublin woman's self-narration after deeply internalizing popular culture's representations of femininity; Gerty has been so inundated by cultural fodder that she is only equipped to tell herself her own story using these materials. Indeed, Gerty's intimate thoughts are disturbingly intertwined with the gendered machinery of consumer culture; if the preceding chapter, Cyclops, links maleness and subsequent male aggression with ideologies of nationalism, Nausica links the enactment of femininity with sentimental novels like The Lamplighter and advertisements for beauty products. For example, Gerty's physical description is interwoven with the list of beauty products she uses. The text reads, Gerty's [eyes] were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novellete, who had first advised her to try eyebrow line…so becoming in leaders of fashion…Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face, but your nose?(286). In this passage the overly sentimental prose voice gives way to the language of advertisements, not only suggesting that texts like the Princess Novellete profoundly effects the ways Gerty experiences her own body, but that they are, in fact, one in the same. Gerty has so internalized the language and ideology of these magazines that they are inseparable from her experience of herself.

Yet while it is plausible that the prose style of Nausica reflects Gerty's profound internalization of cultural materials and subsequent construction of her self-narrative with this equipment, there are moments in the chapter that feel like Gerty isn't corroborating with her own narration but is instead being forcibly narrated by the greater cultural script. Evidence of this can be explored in the script's absence – moments where the narrative slips up, and allows unscripted prose to intrude. Fissures between subject and narrator can be witnessed in Gerty's unsentimental anger with her companions. For example, Edy Boardman is described as an Irritable little gnat(295), a confounded little cat(297), and as a little kinnatt (297), language and sentiments that violate the greater social code of feminine appropriateness. Gerty also internally notes that Cissy Caffery whistled to show what a great person she was(301). This clunky, jealous remark lacks the obscuring sentimentality of the opening paragraph, suggesting a snapshot into Gerty's mental world that is adulterated by an external narrative voice. Additionally, the phrase …and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again), can find it in his head to blame her…(288), is particularly suspect. The retrospective quality of the parenthetical aside seems uncharacteristic of Gerty's inner-monologue and instead suggests the presence of an external, narrating force. Another fissure can be detected in the use of compound words like girlwoman and dreamhusband – conspicuously innovative language that may reflect Gerty's unexplored emotional urgency and creativeness. The suspicion that Gerty possesses qualities that the narrative prose can only hint at, and the ambiguity as to if Gerty is narrating (leading) or being narrated (led), can be read as a commentary on the non-stop machine of modernity that subsumes the lives of Dublin' inhabitants; a controlling, confining force that molds narrative facts to fit an acceptable form. It is just this type of phenomenon that requires subversion later, in Circe.

Yet whether or not Gerty is entirely complicit with her own stifling narration, this much is clear: for Joyce, a realist, Gerty's disembodiment and idealization must be problematized by the intrusion of base, bodily realities, like menstruation. As expected, Gerty's treatment of menstruation is in keeping with her adherence to socially appropriate norms: an account of her menstruation is so buried in the text that readers are likely to miss it. Furthermore, Gerty dumbly calls her menstruation that thing, reflecting a deep disengagement that is further juxtaposed by Bloom's frankness on the subject at the chapter's close. So while Gerty is obsessed with the pop cultural machinery of femininity, she cannot even adequately name the biological reality that makes her a female. Gerty's treatment of her own menstruation in this chapter therefore offers further commentary on the ways that appropriate females, like Gerty, aren't equipped with the tools to truthfully confront their own bodies.

Further compounding this criticism is Gerty's textual ties to the Virgin Mary, the archetype of idealized, pure females. The Virgin Mary is introduced in the first paragraph of the chapter and thus, from the outset, offers a frame through which to consider Gerty's insistent purity. As the chapter continues, sounds from the nearby temperance retreat are interspersed with Gerty's narrative, contributing to the tensions between religion, salvation and sex that dominate this chapter. These religious interpolations are further explored and more highly charged in the paragraph where Gerty starts to menstruate. This paragraph opens with Canon O'Hanlon censing the sacrament and closes with the assurance that Bloom is literally worshipping at her [Gerty's] shrine (296). The juxtaposition of Gerty's menstrual blood against this religious imagery asks readers to consider the link between the church, purified body and blood, and the actual, physical bodies and blood of parishioners. Readers ask asked to probe the hypocrisy of an institution that elevates blood and body in their symbolic form, but has bred a culture that teaches women to be so shameful of their blood and bodies that they confess their menstruation to priests as if it were a sin, as Gerty did.

In Nausica, Joyce gives us a portrait of a woman who is shaped by the gender expectations of the Church and the non-stop machinery of modern consumer culture. These confining forces, reflected in the confining prose, contribute to a system that won't acknowledge Gerty's pain, won't allow her tools to truthfully handle her body, and allows her to be visually consumed and subsequently dismissed by Bloom. However, Gerty's reappearance in Circe momentarily subverts these forces, and, importantly, her menstrual blood is her weapon. In doing so, Joyce allows Gerty to use menstruation, the biological reality which is most quintessentially feminine, to resist and ironize the violence done to her by virtue of her gender.

In Circe, Gerty performs a heightened, perverted version of herself and a stripped-down, absurdist version of the events and themes of Nausica. Gerty's first line in Circe is a misquotation of the groom's script for a Catholic marriage ceremony; she says With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (361). Her bungling of a religious, male script is a further perversion of her tie to the Virgin Mary and a further indictment of the way that Gerty constructs her narrative using borrowed, inappropriate texts and language. However, most jolting is the fact that Gerty does not hold a ring, but her own menstrual blood to perform the marriage ceremony. The absurdity of the scene and its conflation of the many themes of Nausica resist easy understanding and consumption, and in doing so Gerty has resisted our easy understanding and consumption.

The sly peek-a-boo essence of her interaction with Bloom is also imitated and subverted in Circe. For example, in the same coy way that she exposed herself to Bloom in Nausica, she now shows coyly her bloodied clout(361), forcing him to confront biological realities of what lays behind her feminine identity and subsequent easy consumption. This perverted, sensationalized retelling of Nausica forces both Bloom and a reader to confront what has been stifled or only subtly explored in Gerty's Nausica.

Furthermore, in Nausica, Gerty's code of appropriateness only allowed her to partially and untruthfully engage with her own body; though she was willing to explore those parts of herself that made her attractive to the social, male gaze, she was unequipped to acknowledge parts of her body that are socially deemed ugly or inappropriate, like menstruation. But in Circe, Gerty's compartmentalized version of her body breaks down. For example, Gerty tells Bloom in reference to her menstruation, You did that…When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (361). Her words imply a cause and effect relationship; as if her sexual episode with Bloom forced her to recognize the whole of her body, not just superficial elements that make her attractive to Bloom. This inability to omit the ugly realities of the body when confronting the sexualized body is essential to Joyce's crusade against unrealistic, untruthful and harming idealizations of women.

Complicating Gerty's act of subversion in Circe is its situation as a hallucination; though readers are allowed to witness this act, the Gerty Macdowell of Nausica never actually confronts Bloom. However, the fact that Gerty's act of resistance exists in the imaginary realm only further emphasizes Gerty's actual confinement.

Molly's account of menstruation in Penelope acts as foil to Gerty's stifled portrayal in Nausica, and over-the-top portrayal in Circe, but simultaneously operates in much the same way and toward the same end as these other depictions; just as Gerty's menstruation in Nausica punctuated and punctured her insistence on a sentimental unreality, Molly's menstruation in Penelope operates as a punctuation of her candid remarks by further emphasizing the reality of her body and real bodily desires. This realism, epitomized in phrases like I bet the cat itself is better off that us have we too much blood up in us and its pouring out of me like the sea (633), forces readers to confront their own comfort level with discussions of the body. Molly never waves her bloody clout in the face of many men who fantasize about her, but her frankness about her menstruation is just as shocking and complicating; Joyce therefore sensationalizes menstruation by merely normalizing it and situating it as the ordinary occurrence that it is.

The above is mirrored in Molly's narrative prose. Unlike Gerty's third person narrative that is suspiciously encroached upon by external forces, Molly's fluid, slippery prose cannot even be bounded by punctuation and standardized grammar. This is not to suggest that Molly doesn't suffer from confining, gendered expectations – in fact, Molly, like Gerty, mentions beauty products like antifat pills and skin lotion (618) in conjunction with a consideration of her body – only that this is Joyce's textual depiction of a space that allows honest engagement with the body.

As a bodily reality, Molly's account of menstruation operates in the same way as portrayals of other bodily realities throughout the novel: it ironizes and punctures that which is too inflated or ideal. For example, at one point Bloom recounts a memory of him and Molly at the opera. He explains that, She looked fine…Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotized, listening. Eyes like that.(233). However, we learn from Molly that the posturing of her body was motivated by the onset of menstruation. She explains, I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested(633). This portrait not only qualifies the feminine ideal by introducing the realities of menstruation, but also qualifies idealized memories and interpersonal relationships. However, like Gerty's resistance in Circe, Molly's puncturing of Bloom's self-heroic memory is complicated because Molly does not actually express the above to Bloom. Yet, this is an important moment nonetheless; the dramatic irony produced by the two very different accounts of the same episode is essential to the ultimate aims a novel that explores the tragi-comedy of the human condition. Significantly, this irony is brought on by the bodily realities that are so often ignored.

In normalizing menstruation, Joyce also rightfully portrays it as a life experience with a temporal quality. Both Bloom and Molly use menstruation to access the past. For example, as Molly starts to menstruate, her mind wanders to previous episodes of menstruation. Similarly, when Bloom considers the possibility of Gerty menstruating, his mind momentarily latches on to his past, intimate experiences with menstruation, commenting that Sometimes Milly and Molly together.(301). Bloom's knowledge about Milly and Molly's menstrual cycles only results from the type of intimacy that Ulysses ultimately celebrates; this phrase reveals that the intimacy that keeps Molly and Bloom together is grounded in an awareness and familiarity with each other's bodies, menstruation and all.

This sentiment is echoed in one of Bloom's poems to Molly, as recounted by Molly in Penelope. It reads, Precious one everything connected with your Glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and joy for ever(634). This sentiment is crucial to understanding Joyce's portrait of true intimacy. As opposed to sentimental love that operates within the parameters of greater social acceptability, for Joyce, true intimacy is an acceptance and celebration of everything underlined connected to the body, even that which is deemed ugly or vulgar. Further evidence of the aforementioned is Joyce's own erotic love letters to his wife, Nora, which similarly celebrate the real-ness of bodies being intimate. So bodily realities not only serve to puncture and problematize inflations or idealizations, but once recognized and accepted, also offer the avenues to true intimacy.

In Circe, Joyce sensationalizes menstruation by his extreme depiction and in Penelope he sensationalizes menstruation by revealing its ordinariness. Both portrayals problematize a reader's understanding of gender and allow a space to consider femininity, violence, and intimacy.",0,0,0,0,18584
English,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,"Seasons, Ages, Cycles: All As You Like It","An easy place to begin an analysis of this production of As You Like It could be a discussion of its conceptual, technical, even aesthetic disharmonies relative to the play's original text. However, in the spirit of conducting analysis rather than writing review, a better starting point might be to question the possible motivations underlying directorial choices, specifically how the director might have sought to link such choices with several key thematic tones arising from the original text. In this sense, answers to these questions can be found by closely examining two major elements of the production's setting: historical orientation and set design. With these elements specifically, the production embodies the thematic parallelism of seasonal, generational, even historical cycles found abundantly in the text.

Beginning with a discussion of the textual basis of the play's themes, it suffices to say that the overarching impression of intergenerational conflict is inaugurated almost immediately. In the immediate action of the play, the older generation's fear of being supplanted by the younger is reflected by Oliver's schemes against Orlando and Duke Frederick's banishment of Rosaline. Consequently, the younger generation's desire to overturn the order established by the dominant elder generation is represented by Orlando's dissatisfaction with his Oliver's tyranny and Celia's decision to leave the city with Rosalind. Also, it is represented on both symbolic and literal levels as Orlando heaves Charles, Frederick's older and champion wrestler, to his defeat during a match.

However, there is another dimension to this theme added by the realities that Duke Senior is older than his usurping brother Frederick, and the servant Adam is older than his oppressive master Oliver. To fit this disparity into proper context, it helps to consider Orlando's words to Adam O good old man, how well in thee appears/The constant service of the antique world,/ […] Thou art not for the fashion of these times, (2.3.56-58). At this point in the analysis, a historical model such as Hesiod's can be applied in which the span of human existence is broken into ages beginning with glorious golden age and degenerating to oppressive iron perpetual present of the age. In this context, Orlando's lines create comparisons between the not-so-coincidentally-named Adam, his biblical namesake, and the just, benevolent figures of a more glorious past. Similarly, the deceased Sir Rowland de Boys and the exiled Duke Senior fit quite clearly with this impression of suppressed or lost glory.

One more thematic lens must be used to properly see how all these themes align: the cyclic nature of the seasons. The present of the play is situated within winter, presumably near the end, as evidenced by Duke Senior's words Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,/The seasons' difference; as the icy fang and churlish winter's wind,/Which when it bites and blows upon my body […], (2.1.5-8), as well as the Pages' song And therefore, take the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,/For Love is crowned with the prime,/In the spring time, [etc.], (5.3.28-31). Not only to these passages situate the play within a transition from winter to spring, but the Pages' song specifically seems to inject the play with a rather optimistic note. Applying Northrup Frye's model of Shakespearean comedy, the connotations of spring such as youth, rebirth, vitality, and liberality would correspond to youthful lovers like Orlando and Rosalind who oppose characters like Frederick and thus, the established order of winter, death, stasis, and conservatism. In this sense, the Pages' song can be read as an affirmation that spring will overtake winter, and even further, that the younger generation will supplant the older. Similarly, the play's final act substantiates this interpretation, ultimately ending with the restoration of Duke Senior to power, Adam to relative health, and the glory of the golden age to the kingdom.

To connect these themes with aspects of the production, it makes sense to begin simply with superficial directorial choices like set design, costuming, colors, and other such features. By comparing sets like Frederick's palace to that of the Forest of Arden, it becomes clear that the production attempts to assert a visual contrast between the locations. The palace is furnished austerely with dark, heavily finished wood panels, bleachers, and an imposing portrait of Frederick rendered without color (hidden behind this is a colorful portrait of Duke Senior). Though the austerities of color and decor might not consciously evoke themes of seasons, ages of man, and intergenerational conflict, they do register implicitly, legitimizing Frederick as a tyrannical figure. Conversely, the Forest of Arden is lavishly rendered in vivid colors and populated with flora and fauna. In this way, the visual aspects of the forest become associated with the characters dwelling within it. Again, overarching thematic impressions do not arise from the sets themselves but rather, the sets provide an additional avenue by which characters' actions, words, and consequently, aspects of theme can be expressed.

Such visual elements of setting really begin to give rise to theme during characters' interactions, at which points they highlight relevant aspects of speech and action. As the intergenerational conflict plays out, the associations of visual austerity with Frederick and chromatic abundance with the young lovers become clear and embody the thematic impressions of the text. The warm colors of the forest along with speech like the Pages' song, lead to associations between the youthful characters and spring time. Again, this contrasts with the visual austerity of the city which becomes associated with Frederick and winter. The respective portraits of Frederick and Duke Senior provide another example of how visual elements lead to theme. In the context of the production's historical orientation in the 1950's, it is hard to resist a figurative comparison of the colorless portrait of Frederick to a black-and-white television. Similarly, Duke Senior's portrait would signify color television. Historically, as the color television replaces the black-and-white, these images create the impression that Duke Senior (and the characters aligned with him) will replace Frederick. Again, linking this to Hesiod and Frye, the restoration of Duke Senior's power thematically represents the transition from winter to spring, conservativism to liberalism, and the iron age back to the golden age.

Finally, the choice to set the play in the 1950's is probably the most significant way the director brought the plays' themes, specifically that of intergenerational conflict, to the forefront. This period in the United States historically is associated with the emergence of what might be operationally referred to as the post-World War Two patriarchy. In this period, social conservativism dominated in a way similar to that of Frederick's rule. Again, applying Frye's comedic model, this conservatism would correspond to the winter season and adulthood. However, by setting the play in this era, it is beholden to a historical trajectory in which the social revolution of the 1960's overturns the established order. Just so, this is the case with the characters dwelling in the Forest of Arden who regain control of the kingdom.

Admittedly, it is difficult to make conclusive inferences as to which aspects of the production correspond allegorically to aspects of the historical period, especially considering the fact that Frederick abdicates his rule while in the various counterculture movements of the 1960's more or less seized control. However, period details of the production such as music and costume suggest that both decades were represented. Some of the more austere elements of set design and costuming, specifically those without color or associated with the city, corresponded to the 1950's. Motifs of this decade begin to break down in the forest when color is introduced in ways evocative of 1960's phenomenon such as the proliferation of color television or the mass experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs. In this way, it makes sense to view the inclusion of motifs of both decades in these respective locations and scenes as a way of portraying the transition from one decade to the next. Even Jacques' recitation of his all the world's a stage monologue as a beat poem, the most unambiguously 1950's moment in the Forest of Arden, is still a point of transition as the Beats historically helped pave the way for the dissidents of the 1960's. For these reasons, the pervasive impressions of transition from one decade to the next, conservativism to liberalism, the older generation to the next, and the winter to the spring are ultimately reinforced.

Through its choices regarding set design and historical orientation, the production of As You Like It highlights the play's textual themes of seasonal, generational, and historical cycles. By visually contrasting locations, the production reinforces the oppositions represented and dramatized by the characters interacting within them. Color choices strengthen associations between characters and their symbolic representations like seasons, generations, and ages. By incorporating 1950's and 1960's motifs, the intergenerational conflicts of that era thematically parallel such conflicts within the play. By using period-specific details, the production blends these two decades and achieves an impression of transition from one to the next. Ultimately, the production links text to performance and late 16th century England to mid 20th century America, dramatizing the universality of cycles, seasons, degeneration, and restoration.",0,0,0,0,9834
English,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Daughter says Ach!: Probing the Space Between Form and Content Via Rewriting Anzia Yezierska as John Dos Pasos and Vice-Versa,"Confronted with the task of comparing two modernist texts for the purpose of seeking a deeper understanding of both novels, I chose How I Found America by Anzia Yezierska and 1919 by John Dos Pasos, hoping that their marked divergence of styles would make for a compelling pair. Their authors write so differently, in fact, I wondered what each of the texts would look like written in the style of the other. Could their plots be translated without contradicting the narrative’s style? Would common themes emerge or be obscured? Having written Daughter’s last Character Story in Yezierska’s style and Dreams and Dollars in Dos Pasos’ style, my retrospective observations about the texts and my own act of writing has taught me that the each authors’ style serves their literary agendas. Yezierska’s emotional, deeply internal narration contributes to her characters’ passions and tenacity to succeed, while Dos Pasos’ unsentimental, external narration estranges both the reader from the characters and the characters from one another, almost predicting their descent.

First, I wrote a part of Daughter’s last Character Story beginning on page 323 in the style of Yezierska. I selected Daughter because, like Yezierska’s characters, she’s a young woman in an unfamiliar country, and I was struck by that similarity. Furthermore, I was curious to see if I could render Daughter’s decision to kill herself and her ultimate death in Yezierska’s optimistic tone.

""My heart is broken! Every hope I had is lost and I have nobody in this whole wide world!"" Daughter cried as she lay in bed. Suddenly, through the open window blew the intoxicating scent of the cyclamens, those bright harbingers of love that Daughter had seen that day on the mountain in Rome and she thought of (5) Dick Savage. Dick Savage! How her very small, dark world had opened up the day she met him! The way he spoke French and Italian so fluently, it was as if he were God sent to speak endless tongues on her behalf, to guide her in this strange city.

 A wave of nausea ravished her and she closed her eyes, sucked down (10)again into that eternal spinning darkness. Why did she always have to feel things so intensely? Dick had held her to his breast, and her heart had beat so quick like the wings of birds as if to drive him back and escape, but she felt herself sink into lust for his kiss. And now their child, burning with the furious intensity of new life and their love, grew within her and Dick did not want it! 

(15) Daughter moaned and beat her fists against her own weak body. ""Why did I give in?"" she wailed, ""Why did I sacrifice what worldly good this mind could have done for something so base?"" She had wanted to become like Dick, to do something that would help the new world after the war. Again she lifted her head to up and saw the bright sky outside her window. To be a poet like (20) him! To live anywhere, even on the cheapest sort of bread, filling the aching hunger in their souls with the beauty of their words! 

But how could she tame the passion that choked her without Dick? She needed someone to pull her up from her wretched condition. Someone to support her and help care for their child if she wanted to spend her days at the desk with a (25) pen and not at the washtub with a scrub board, doing laundry to earn her keep. ""Unbearable!"" Daughter shrieked. ""I didn’t travel to this country in this time of opportunity, everyone united under the auspices of a new world, to work with my hands!""

Suddenly, there was a knock at her door, and Dick had burst in and taken (30) her in his arms. Could it be? Had her sun and life truly returned? ""No—no! You said you didn’t want me!"" Daughter gasped, disturbed by his sudden ardor.

""No, my love,"" Dick said, clasping one of her hands in his and placing his other on her stomach, ""It is I who should be abandoned. I who failed to see the value of that shining future in you!""

One thing that became immediately apparent as I rewrote Daughter’s story was the impossibility of conveying the actual events of the story. Yezierska stays so closely inside her characters’ minds and tracks their emotional movements so minutely that even though I only wrote one moment from Daughter’s story, her psychological flights sustained a plausible narrative without me ever making her leave the bed in her room. Conversely, I suddenly understood why Dos Pasos is able to cover so much plot time—because the inner feelings of his characters are largely absent. Indeed, the only clues Dos Pasos gives about Daughter’s feelings are brief and facile. When she finds out she’s pregnant, she feels nothing more than scared and her decision to kill herself comes as a complete whim in the bathroom while she lunches with Barrow (Dos Pasos 324, 27). Faced with imaging how Daughter might feel in these instances, it was surprisingly easy to extrapolate her emotions in lines 11-14, especially given the themes that occur so often in Yezierska’s work as a basis to build upon, such as a preference for the new and the passionate, and a complex relationship with men and how they can help or hinder women achieve intellectual goals. Nevertheless, I found that these themes didn’t seem terribly in conflict with what Daughter might be feeling in Dos Pasos’ mind. Just as Rebecca is flattered by Moe’s romantic attention but ultimately disgusted by his lust for material wealth in Dreams and Dollars, (223) Daughter tells Dick making love is magnificent… Oh, I wish I was dead (297) in one single line, expressing a profound ambivalence about losing her virginity. Since most of Dos Pasos’ female characters come off two-dimensional and fairly powerless, intensifying Daughter’s feelings through Yezierska’s tone made me wonder if her wishing for death wasn’t just a way of giving up but an expression of a deeper agency.

Other common themes became apparent, such as Yezierska’s idealism about America and her lofty treatment of intellectual pursuits. Although lines 26-28 sound strongly of Yezierska, Daughter too has a strong desire to improve conditions in wartime Europe when she tells her family others had given their lives to save the world… and… she… certainly could give up six months to relief work (227). When I read how Daughter believed Dick would be a famous writer (324) it reminded me immediately of Rebecca’s admiration for Felix because his poetry filled the room… [with] wonder and beauty (Yezierska 225). Neither Rebecca nor Daughter like poetry for specific reasons other than its being a path to something higher, more ethereal. Most of all, using such explosive, internal language to explore Daughter’s feelings made them more transparent and insistent in a way that is absent in Dos Pasos. Daughter tells Mr. Barrow she can’t get along with the old cats in the N.E.R., but she never explains why or defines what she’d rather be doing.

For this reason, it made the most sense to me to end Daughter’s story optimistically. No one ever contemplates suicide or dies in any of the Yezierska’s stories we read for class. Even when Shennah Pessah from Wings is crushed by her loneliness (Yezierska 4) she feels the sun on her cheeks and [drinks] in the miracle of the sunlit wall. Nor could I imagine Daughter leading Mr. Barrow on romantically or dancing tightly with a Frenchman she’d just met in a bar in Yezierska’s literary world (Dos Pasos 324, 3). The fact that Yezierska’s style trumped the content of Dos Pasos’ plot to the point that I felt the ending to Daughter’s story must be changed points to the enormous power of Yezierska’s form and how it serves to benefit her content. Furthermore, it reveals a similar power in Dos Pasos’ style—that his characters’ lack of upfront emotions is part of the reason why their passions and idealism seem to fade away so easily.

Next, I wrote the story Dreams and Dollars in the style of Dos Pasos. Knowing from my first exercise how profoundly Yezierska’s style dictated the content of Dos Pasos’ story as I rewrote it, I selected Dreams and Dollars because it presents a situation in which a character’s values are put to the test. When Rebecca leaves the squalor of New York tenement living and discovers her sister Minnie’s lavish life and Moe, a man who will financially support her if Rebecca chooses, she is forced to choose between the moral value of an austere lifestyle, close to her Russian Jewish roots, or a comfortable lifestyle with a higher degree of American assimilation. Would Dos Pasos’ tendency to distance his characters from their own thoughts and feelings incline Rebecca to fall victim to Minnie’s decadence?

When she got to Los Angeles, Rebecca was very impressed by the richlooking residential houses. She found her sister Minnie’s house and knocked on the door. Minnie answered. She seemed heavier than Rebecca remembered. ""It’s been ten years,"" she cried, taking Rebecca in her arms. Come meet my (5) husband, Abe. Abe was the rich banker Minnie had moved away from New York to marry. ""Finally I’ll have some peace,"" he said jovially, ""Minnie’s been lonely for you ever since I brought her here. Do stay and keep her company; in the meantime, you must meet Moe."" ""Looking like that?"" Minnie broke in, ""Everyone will know she came straight from Delancey street."" Rebecca noticed (10) her sisters hands were covered in diamond rings and she tried to forget her own threadbare jumper. Moe arrived with a box of candy for Rebecca that was more delicious than any she had ever eaten. Dinner was even more lavish, and after she had stuffed herself Moe took her outside and showed her a gleaming red limousine. ""Swellest car on the market. I got it the minute your sister said you (15) were coming."" Rebecca flushed. She knew he was after her and wondered what harm it would do to let him love her a little, but Felix was the only one for her. Moe must’ve seen her looking off and he asked, ""What can I do to please you? Let me try a little."" Rebecca thought and said, ""I love music! If only I could afford the opera."" Moe laughed and the slight condescension in his voice (20) made Rebecca scowl. ""The music I like best is composed by the cash register. Just jingling coins in my hands makes me feel more grand than any opera I’ve ever heard."" He went on talking about his money and Rebecca thought he was a great dullard. When she walked back in the house her Minnie and Abe were putting out brandies and ashtrays for a card party. Rebecca didn’t much care (25) for cards and she though smoking was a dirty habit but Minnie insisted she play. Moe drew a chair close to his and beckoned with a hand. ""Sit near me, Little Queen, I’ll teach you the rules."" Minnie and Abe’s friends came, stuffy people in silk evening dresses and smoking jackets. The kind of money they tossed on the table would have bought Rebecca groceries for weeks. Moe kept (30) pointing at the little red hearts and numbers on his cards but she couldn’t make any sense out of it because the smoke in the air made her head feel like a balloon. She asked for a drink of water and Moe brought her a glass of wine that burned her throat. ""I can’t do this,"" she said and stood. ""But you’re my charm! I’ve just won another hundred,"" Moe said, grasping her hand. ""It’s not just the (35) money,"" Minnie broke in, ""When I play I get so excited I forget about everything. There’s no past—no future—only the now—the life of the game. Please stay."" Minnie’s eyes were wide and Rebecca felt badly leaving her there. Her only sister. She sat again and really listened when Moe told her what a good hand looked like. When her glass got low someone filled it and she drank until (40) her head throbbed but in a pleasantwarm way like her own heartbeat. Moe had an arm around her shoulders and when he whispered in her ear he would kiss it and chuckle like he had done it by mistake. His breath smelled sour and dark and Rebecca felt herself slump against him, glad that she didn’t have to hold herself up any longer.

Just as it was impossible for me to rewrite more than just a moment from Daughter’s story in Yezierska’s style because of her deeply internal narration, I was able to compress most of Yezierska’s 13-page story in about a page due to the near complete absence of psychological movement. In fact, I felt more like I was summarizing a plot than telling a story—something that likely indicates my own personal preference for character monologue in my own creative writing. On the other hand, escaping Yezierska’s claustrophobic closeness and volatile shifts in emotion felt liberating. I intentionally left the sentiment in line 4 that Minnie seems heavier ambiguous, just as Daughter describes Mr. Barrow with The gap was very wide between his front teeth when he smiled (Dos Pasos 326). Daughter doesn’t implicitly state that she likes or dislikes this gap, but we can tell from the way she ultimately treats Mr. Barrow badly that she hold this trait against him. While Dos Pasos runs the risk of being only scenic and not specific in terms of what the characters feel, his objectivity does open up a range of emotions for his characters and also gives the reader more of a chance to form their own opinions instead of being bound so closely, as in Yezierska’s case.

Nevertheless, as soon as I began to extract myself from Yezierska’s characters’ minds they became more two-dimensional. Although I chose to keep Moe’s dialogue about the music of cash registers in lines 20-22, I removed his internalization about Rebecca, A sudden pity gripped him. He longed to brighten the lonely look of this little greenhorn, put roses into her pale thin cheeks and Rebecca’s internalization about Moe, The light that burned… in the eyes of poets… burned also in the eyes of the traders of her race (Yezierska 224). Knowing that Moe pities Rebecca’s hardships and sincerely wishes to show her the pleasures of wealth makes his interest in her seem more than sexual, but a philanthropic and even selfless. Likewise, when Rebecca concedes that Moe’s passion about making money is the same as a poet’s passion for writing, she validates him as person with dreams and not just a slave to the dollar. When I removed these things, I realized Moe had the capacity to become a much more sinister character, only concerned with possessing Rebecca sexually. Mr. Barrow undergoes a similar transformation when he tells Daughter, You’re the only girl I’ve ever known who seemed really a beautiful pagan at heart and begs her to be with him (Dos Pasos 330). Up until this point, he’s taken Daughter out to dinners, had many benign conversations with her, and she even describes him as understanding an kind (326). When he brings up the concept of paganism, however, and kisses Daughter wetly in the ear (330) his former niceties are overshadowed with what seems like a very sexual overture, reducing him to nothing more than an old pervert.

Thus, Dos Pasos’ tendency to simplify his characters makes them less reliable and more prone to disappointing reader expectations on the whole. For all their passion and optimism they are almost set up to fail, and this realization compelled me to let Rebecca flounder in Los Angeles’ moral degradation. Another reason I selected Dreams and Dollars is the story features a party, an opportunity for Rebecca’s state-of-consciousness to be altered in such a way that signals her falling away from the narrative. In lines 43 and 44, I tried to mimic Dos Pasos’ This time she didn’t feel so bad… The spinning sun blinded her as they dropped (Dos Pasos 332, 3). Daughter’s almost peacefully accepts her own death and the cessation of her sight as she’s blinded marks an end to her consciousness, her role as a focalizer in the narration. Recreating this exit, I realized its grace and aptness in a story where characters only ever seem vaguely aware of their role in the world. The violence of the plane crash is never referred to, only a fall made endless by the ceasing of narrative before the point of impact.

If I had asked the question in my thesis as to the connection between style and content for Yezierska and Dos Pasos and attempted to answer it using only a close-reading of the texts, I wouldn’t have stumbled across revelations nearly as provocative and illuminating as having done this exercise in creative writing. Slipping into the shoes of the writers performed miracles in terms of understanding the literary choices they made and why they might have made them, and pitting these two texts together in this way was a powerful demonstration of the interdependence of form and content in literature. Most surprising to me was despite Yezierska and Dos Pasos’ entirely different styles and agendas, optimism and pessimism, both texts still shared themes common to modernism. Even in the act of writing I was aware that I’d opened up many more valuable avenues for comparison than the limitations of time and this paper allow, but I hope that even this preliminary exploration proves exciting, and that this topic becomes a regular option (even requirement, I daresay) for students in future courses. It’s 3:38 in the morning and I’ve sincerely had fun.",0,0,1.76,0.61,17165
English,Report,Undergraduate,Woolf's Women: Behind the Walls,"As Virginia Woof sees it, the traditional roles of women in society seem as oppressive as being confined to the home, and as enslaving as being considered mere possessions of their husbands. In A Room of One's Own, Woolf subtly draws comparisons between a woman's subordinate lifestyle and a slave's inferior societal status. Constantly subjected to isolation and derogatory discourse, women lack both the respect and the opportunity needed in order to achieve social equality. Similarly trapped in rooms of their own, the women in Chopin's The Story of An Hour and in Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper remain secluded from the outside world; similar to slaves, these women are unable to openly express their opinions and abilities without retaliated repression from men – their superiors by social standards.

While slaves were born into subordination, women were married into it: [I]n fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger (Woolf 44). Woolf depicts the sacrament of marriage as an enforcement of social stratification instead of a symbiotic benchmark in a relationship. Once married, women become property of their husbands, like slaves to their masters, and can hardly read, and scarcely spell. Instead of being encouraged to express themselves, both slaves and women are forced to live simplistic lives free from the influence of literature or of higher education. Women lack these skills not because of disinterest, but instead because of social pressures: She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew and not moon about with books and papers (47). Conditioned to be ashamed of the desire to express their thoughts, women will scribble some pages up in an apple loft on the sly, but will be careful to hide them or set fire to them later, as the demonstration of intelligence seems to be a shameful sin. Men, distorted by their need for masculinity, further discourage women from playing active roles in society by talking down to them and distorting women's views of their importance in the greater community. Woolf emphasizes the constant re-enforcement of this male-dominated perspective by incorporating the term overcome in order to create a parallel between the plight of slavery and the struggle of women: There would always have been that assertion – you cannot do this, you are incapable of doing that – to protest against, to overcome (54). Woolf then powerfully refers to the gender struggle as [t]he history of men's opposition to women's emancipation, thus highlighting the imprisoning aspect of women's life in a patriarchal society (55). Meanwhile, women's hidden talent and contribution to humanity remains concealed by the oppressive ego's of their male counterparts.

Similar to Virginia Woolf's portrayal of women in society, the woman from The Yellow Wallpaper also finds herself confined within the nightmarish pattern of female life. Driven to insanity from constantly holding back their intellectual talent, women become even more deeply trapped within the walls of oppression. The woman from the story becomes quarantined to a small room due to her diagnosed emotional madness. Left alone to analyze her surroundings, the woman becomes engaged in the intricacies of the faded yellow wallpaper. Eventually, she claims that several women, symbolizing herself and other demoralized women in her community, appear to be on the other side of the wallpaper, straining to break through its boundaries: Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over (Gilman). The woman's desire to analyze the yellow paper acts as an emotional outlet for her suppressed intellect, as she strives to express her imaginative potential. Gilman further depicts the woman as coming to grips with her inferior status as the woman observes that the faces behind the wallpaper are all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern – it strangles so. Metaphorically, women are constantly attempting to break through the gender barrier in which men enforce. However, the pattern, or traditional societal boundaries, will not submit.

As Woolf suggests women's ownership to their husbands, Kate Chopin also speaks to women's enslavement to men. In The Story of an Hour, Mrs. Mallard experiences breathtaking relief upon hearing of the assumed death of her husband: She said it over and over under her breath: 'free, free, free'(Chopin). Although she feels slightly guilty for feeling joy instead of sorrow, Mrs. Mallard revels in the idea that [t]here would be no one to live for anymore, and instead she would live for herself. However, this feeling of freedom is short-lived, as is the false assumption of her husband's death; Mrs. Mallard's heart fails and she falls to her death upon the sight of her husband walking through the front door. Does her instantaneous death symbolize her eternal freedom from an oppressive marriage? Or does it instead represent a form of punishment for her happiness of the thought of her husband's death – re-emphasizing the attempt to keep women in their place?

Ironically, while all three authors are elite, literary, educated women, they are still socially isolated and bound by sexist norms in society. Thus, Woolf, Gilman, and Chopin mirror the oppressed women in their stories; in a way, these authors make acknowledgeable statements about life from their perspectives by writing about upper-class women who still lack the opportunity to be viewed and treated as equal individuals, despite their economic statuses. Similarly, all of the authors must have felt emotionally tied-down to their husbands as they were simultaneously constrained by society – much like the struggling women in the stories. Therefore, the authors can almost be viewed as portraying nuances of their own personal struggles in the third-person.

From Woolf to Chopin, the subordination of women in a gender-stratified society puts a damper on their traditional intellectual and social development. Like slaves, women from earlier centuries were viewed and treated as mere accessories to American culture. Fortunately, similar to any other frivolous trend, the concept of the inferiority of women continues to outdate itself.",0,0,0,0,6421
English,Report,Undergraduate,Douglass' Declaration,"The concept of freedom carries a relative and subjective meaning. Every Fourth of July, the people of the United States magically forget their previous battles with family members, neighbors, and third-world-countries, as they gather over grilled food and under explosive fireworks. The initial importance of our country's freedom from British control dissipates as quickly as a pack of sparklers. In his Address, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July, delivered on July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass glorifies the people's perpetual praise of America's patriotic accomplishments, which Jefferson launched through the Declaration of Independence. Douglass relates to his audience of white abolitionists by using rhetorical devices and stylistic approaches while acknowledging the ambitious accomplishments of the country's Founding Fathers. His powerful use of repetition, metaphor, and juxtaposition, combined with strategic syntax and tonal shifts enhance his argument as he engages his audience and maintains credibility – all of which assist in unraveling his shocking conclusion that American values are more impressive on paper than in practice.

Douglass initially speaks from the same level as that of his audience; by stating that he is nervous to be speaking to a large crowd and by addressing the public as his fellow-citizens, Douglass temporarily adopts the viewpoint of an American on Independence Day in order to establish credibility for both himself and his argument (Douglass 380). He uses metaphor as he joins his audience in praising the resilience of the Founding Fathers: As the sheet anchor takes a firm hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger. . . (381).

The stormy fight for independence triumphed with the Declaration of Independence, the ring-bolt in the destiny of the nation. The metaphor of the ring-bolt is designed to give the audience a tangible grasp of the significance of the declaration and leaves them the option of reaping the fruits of success.

After acknowledging America's past achievements, Douglass dramatically shifts his tone as he isolates himself from the collective group by saying that he will see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view and that this Fourth of July is yours, not mine  (386). He claims that July 4th makes a mockery of the realistic situation in America and poses a series of rhetorical questions comparing himself with other citizens: What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? (385) Combining the device of anaphora with more rhetorical questions, he emphasizes his accusations of American ignorance through the phrases you have no right and need I tell you in order to escalate his authority and ethos. Douglass then stresses America's arrogance through antithesis as he juxtaposes people's shallow tolerance with people's actual behavior in their own nation; he condemns the way they are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America (389). Additionally, with Douglass' allusion back to Jefferson and the Declaration, the audience can infer that Douglass implies that although Jefferson symbolized freedom, he owned hundreds of slaves himself, thus further demonstrating the ironic tendencies of human nature and the hypocritical message in his independence speech.

While Douglas dramatically shifts his tone from sharing brotherhood with his audience to speaking in a condescending manner, he equivocates by concluding his speech with a quote by William Lloyd Garrison. By leaving the audience with the inspirational words of God speed the year of jubilee / the wide world o'er, Douglass reinstates the speech's patriotic undertone (390). He ends on a positive note in order to re-establish any credibility that he might have lost during the speech and to ensure that he motivates his audience; it is up to them to mobilize the Declaration of Independence into action like their Founding Fathers had done in past generations. Douglass demands a new Declaration.",0,0,0,0,4154
English,Report,Undergraduate,"Close Reading Paper: The Tempest (4.1.146-163)
Living a Dream"," PROSPERO
146 You do look, my son, in a movèd sort,
As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
150 Are melted into air, into thin air;
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
155 And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.
Bear with my weakness: my old brain is troubled.
160 Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
And there repose. A turn or two I'll walk
To still my beating mind. 

This passage works as a literary mechanism to systematically discuss the interaction between dreams and life. It is structured into three distinct sections which logically interact to convey a single message within the passage. Through the use of short poetic prose, rich diction, and figurative language a dream-like setting is established and related to real-life. This relationship between dreams and the ephemeral nature of life is the underlying message of the passage, and its acknowledgement is essential to the success of the protagonist's plans.

The passage begins in an amicable tone in which the speaker comforts the characters and the reader. This tone is produced through the lines, You do look, my son, in a movèd sort, / As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir./ Our revels now are ended. By using the term my son the passage instantly develops an endearing paternal tone of wisdom, which works to accredit the advice which will follow. In addition, the sense of comfort that the text creates by using Be cheerful, sir. also helps to prepare the reader for the disheartening interpretation of life which they are about to receive.

The second section of the passage, which can be termed the philosophical phase, includes lines 148-158. In this section the text refers to the spirits as our actors, which indicates that the speaker believes that he can direct the actions of those who live within his world. Yet, within the same sentence that he proclaims his control he also posits that his power is in actuality insubstantial because the spirits are melted into air, into thin air. The imagery invoked by the melting spirits begins to create a dream-like setting for the reader to imagine these occurrences and with the next lines these images are substantiated. The passage asserts, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,/ The solemn temples, the great globe itself,/ Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,. This classic fairytale imagery is one which can easily be formed yet can also quickly be disassembled, which is helpful for the reader but also symbolic of the transient nature of dreams as well as life. Furthermore, the passage's inclusion of the globe along with the fantastical images of the towers and palaces also serves to indicate that for some people, including those set in the play, the real world may be synonymous with the dream world. However, in the following lines we are reminded that both are equally as fleeting. Lines 155-156 use diction to relate life as an insubstantial pageant, creating the imagery of an insignificant parade or procession, which expresses a bleak interpretation of life set in this dream state.

The passage eventually concludes its philosophical section by more or less clarifying that there is a relationship between the real life and dreams, yet this section is open to interpretation because of its contradictory language. In lines 156-158 the text reads, We are such stuff/ As dreams are made on, and our little life/ Is rounded with a sleep. Seemingly, when reading this quote in the context of the rest of the passage one may be able to interpret the lines as meaning that if life is composed of dreams, and dreams are particularly transitory, then life itself is transitory. Furthermore, it is in our very nature to dream and even when we are sleeping and taking a rest from pursuing our dreams, we are forming new ambitions which we as humans are forced to pursue.

After coming to the conclusion that life is futile because of its relationship with dreams, the passage enters its third stage which is characteristically apologetic. This section uses excusatory diction to offer an apology to the reader for confronting them with the brutal realities of life which the speaker must face everyday. Indeed, in line 160 he states, Be not disturbed by my infirmity. The word infirmity may have numerous definitions but in this context it is likely a condition or disease produced by weakness, and in this case moral weakness. It seems that the text concludes that the struggle for full realization of ones dreams is useless and debilitating. In order to comfort the reader and dissuade them from facing this fact of life, the passage recommends that they go to sleep and, ironically, take a rest from living their dreams.

Within the context of The Tempest this passage conveys to the reader that Prospero has come to an understanding of the reasons behind his downfall as Duke of Milan. Prospero acknowledges that his complete devotion to his dream of bettering his mind, ultimately cost him his kingdom because he was not knowledgeable of how one must manage their dreams. Indeed, at the moment that this speech is given in the play, he nearly allows his dreams and art to once again lead to his demise as he forgets about Caliban's plot to murder him while watching the nymphs' performance. However, in the end, he does remind himself with this passage about the relationship between life and dreams, and the way in which he must control it. The passage, through its analysis, allows the reader to understand the principles that are essentially responsible for the success of Prospero's plan.

In conclusion, each section and line of the passage plays a specific part in communicating the relationship between dreams and life and the transitory qualities of both. Through diction and figurative language the text systematically builds a dream world only to then dismantle it, and relate to the reader a specific perception of life. This cautionary speech about the devastating power that dreams can have on a person's life is essentially a moral of The Tempest. Without this close reading of the passage the full wisdom of the text may have never been discovered.",0,0,6.86,10.43,6525
English,Report,Undergraduate,Abraham Drafted to Team Galatians,"Paul writes his letter to the Galatians during a transitional period for Christianity. Christianity has not yet become independent of Judaism, but is moving farther away from the observances of Jewish laws. This issue proves to be a point of intense controversy, and Paul takes a side against following Jewish law. In his letter, Paul attempts to explain to the Galatians how Gentiles are blessed through Jesus and why there is no need for them to adopt the code of Moses. Specifically in verse three, Paul makes a critical offensive move for his cause by aligning himself and his views with an important central figure—Abraham. Proving to be a powerful rhetorician, Paul effectively employs language, spins quotations, aims at logic, and provides answers to position Abraham in a way that supports his views.

It is likely at such a confusing and controversial time for Christianity that Paul himself did not really know how the Jesus movement should fit in with the previous laws of Judaism. It seems Paul knew he had to make some statement on this controversy, but was not completely sure what it should be. He does offer a number of opinions on the subject, but few of them are grounded in tangible evidence. However, it is evident in Galatians 3 that Paul knows how to present a persuasive argument. It doesn't matter so much what claim he makes, just that he makes it wholeheartedly.

In this way, Paul lays the foundation for his alignment with Abraham even before he mentions the story of Abraham through his effective use of language. Paul immediately begins verse three by accusing the Galatians: You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? (Galatians 3:1). The first half of this address runs the risk of overly offending the listeners and having them dismiss the rest of Paul's address. However, Paul cleverly adds the second part which plays off the basic human dislike for being tricked. Now the people are not only eager to listen to Paul and find out how they have been fooled, but also eager to believe Paul's words. So even before the story of Abraham is discussed, Paul has set the stage for the Galatians to accept his version of it.

Paul's confident language serves to further the agreeability of what he has to say. The passage is full of small and easily overlooked phrases that prove to be incredibly powerful in the context. He strategically employs such phrases as so you see (3:7), for it is written (3:10), and it is evident (3:11) to create an air of assurance that seems impossible to disagree with. As one point Paul asks, Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? and then answers himself by exclaiming, Certainly not! (3:21). Not only is Paul certain of what he is saying, but also adds an exclamation point for added emphasis on this point.

Interspersed with these strong words of suggestion are pointed rhetorical questions; Paul uses these to engage his reader in accepting his claims. By having no stated answer it would seem that the questions were open for discussion, however, on the contrary, these questions leave no room for dispute. For example, Paul asks, …does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? (3:5). The clear answer Paul is aiming for with this leading question is that God provides the spirit to the people through faith and not through the Jewish laws.

This answer helps the Galatians believe in Paul's words because Paul has twisted his rhetoric in a way that makes the answer obvious. The readers of this letter are made to feel like complete fools if they do not side with Paul. The Galatians would also readily acknowledge the answer to this rhetorical question, though, because Paul makes the answer the easy choice. The Galatians want to receive the Spirit, and it is much easier to receive it by believing than by numerous difficult and extensive Jewish laws.

After expertly priming the Galatians to heed his words, Paul introduces the story of Abraham. In an interesting reinterpretation of the Abraham story, Paul positions Abraham to play on his team. It is confusing that Paul chooses to focus on the importance of Abraham since Abraham is prominent in the Jewish tradition, but, while it is curious, it is something that may not have seemed so at the time. It is also possible that while Paul was attempting to break away from the church in Jerusalem, he did not have a full conception of what that would mean. The text is silent on many of these holes in Paul's reasoning.

One way Paul uses Abraham to promote his views is by putting a new spin on previous quotations from the Bible. Paul uses an earlier quote to explain that just as Abraham 'believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,'… those who believe are the descendants of Abraham (3:6-7). This is only one of many places Paul could be accused of espousing false or skewed logic with his reinterpretation of quotes. It cannot logically be assumed that everyone who believes in God is the descendant of Abraham just because Abraham believed. In this example, Paul delves further into questionable logic by explaining that those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed (3:9). He gives little support for any of these claims, but instead relies on his overbearing rhetoric to cover up flaws in reasoning.

Another place that Paul spins an earlier Biblical quotation to serve his purposes is when he quotes, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree, and then interprets Jesus' cross as a tree. He explains that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us…in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of Spirit through faith (3:13-14). Now Paul is stretching his reasoning to not only align Abraham with his promotion of faith and not Jewish law, but also extend this affiliation through Abraham all the way to Jesus himself. In essence, Paul is forming an undoubtedly powerful team of players to support his offensive move against the Christians who uphold Jewish laws.

There are points in this third verse where Paul also directly aims at logic, whether valid or faulty logic, to promote his views by using Abraham. Paul makes an analogy between a person's will and God's promise to Abraham—just as a will cannot be later added to or annulled neither can God's covenant be added to with laws. He is appealing to the Galatians sense of logic by stating the irrelevance of the Moses code. My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise (3:17). This is a clever move by Paul since he does not claim that these laws do not exist (it is clear they have had a long history), but only that they came after Abraham and no longer serve a purpose now that the people have been delivered through Jesus Christ.

After lying the foundation for and giving his reinterpretation of the Abraham story, Paul smartly gives his answers for the inevitable questions surrounding his interpretation. Paul offers an explanation for how the Jewish laws fit with the Christian faith, and, like he has throughout the letter, he pronounces this with utter certainty: Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith (3:23-24). In this way, Paul explains away the Jewish laws by telling the Galatians why they are no longer necessary.

Paul also expertly answers the inevitable question about how the Gentiles fit into this whole picture of Abraham and Jesus, and how all the differing traditions can come together. His main way of doing this is by eliminating the differences that spawn controversy. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise (3:28-29). This seems to be the final push for the success of Paul's words. Obviously the Galatians would be thrilled to hear that they are Abraham's offspring and that this is made possible through their belief in Jesus Christ.

Throughout his letter, Paul is addressing a willing audience. They want to believe his words and he ensures that they do by promoting his cause through Abraham. Paul proves to be a master rhetorician as he plays with language and logic to champion faith in Jesus over the belief in the Moses code. As his writing progresses, Paul's argument only gains momentum; it is hard to remember if there is any other way to understand the Bible. The recipients of this letter may have started out foolish, but they end almost as heirs to God.",0,19.14,12.47,9.81,8883
English,Report,Undergraduate,Sustenance and Sacrifice: The Symbolic Relationship Between Humans and Animals in Genesis,"One of the most important relationships in the book of Genesis is the relationship between mankind and animals. In the early chapters of the book of Genesis, we learn about Adam and Eve's relationship with animals and how their relationship changed over time. Initially, Adam and Eve were told by God to have dominion over all animals in Genesis1:28 and Adam was said to have given the animals their names in Genesis 1:20. Man is also told in Genesis 1:29-30 that God has given him plants for his food. However, in chapter 9 of Genesis, after the worldwide flood, mankind's relationship with the animal world changes drastically. God tells Noah that animals will fear him, that they are delivered into his (mankind's) hand, and that mankind can now eat animals for food (Genesis 9:2). Although the text is not completely clear on why God began to allow man to eat animals, animals play key roles in both man's initial disobedience to God and in God's attempt to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind.

In the first chapter of Genesis, in verses 24 through 27, we learn that God created animals on the 5th day of creation and humans on the 6th day. In Genesis 1:28, God gives an important commandment to Adam (and Eve) about their relationship with animals and their position and power upon the earth. In Genesis 1:28, God tells them to have dominion over all animals. Dominion is a type of leadership or established rule that denotes a hierarchical structure. In essence mankind was given a leadership role over all of the animals.

Although mankind still seems to have dominion over animals later in Genesis, the relationship between animals and humans changes. In the following quote from Genesis 9:2-3, God speaks to Noah after the worldwide flood and provides information that we can assume is for all mankind.

The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you he green plants, I give you everything (Genesis 9:2-3).

Man will now be feared and dreaded by all types of animals and man is told that God has given him everything. The question is; why did God allow mankind to eat animals after the flood and not before the flood? How does this connect with the roles animals played in Adam's disobedience and mankind's subsequent struggle to have a relationship with God?

The answers to these questions are not completely clear. One of the notes in our version of The New Oxford Annotated Bible hints at a possible reason God allowed man to eat animals. On page 22, near the bottom, editorial authors state,

Here [referring to Gen. 9:2 quoted above] God revises the earlier command of vegetarianism…This is a partial concession to the ""violence"" observed prior to the flood and an extension of the human dominion over creation…(Oxford, 22).

Here the authors wanted to portray God as conceding or giving in to the violence taking place on the earth before the flood mentioned in Genesis 6:5. We can't be sure exactly why God chose to allow man to eat animals and there are a number of reasons that can be presented. We must first remember how an animal played a role in man's initial disobedience.

The serpent was an animal that made an effort to convince Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, it's safe to say that an animal played a role in mankind's first known disobedience toward God. The serpent wasn't responsible for Adam and Eve's decision to eat from the forbidden tree, but asked questions that piqued Eve' curiosity. Eve was persuaded and chose to eat from the tree. She subsequently gave the fruit to Adam and he ate. In this sense, an animal played a role in man's first act of disobedience to God (Genesis 3).

Perhaps God punished all animals because of the sin of one animal [the serpent] in influencing man to disobey God. As a result of the deceitful ways of the serpent, God may have chosen to punish all animals for the serpent's role in causing man's strained relationship with God. The serpent was given a special curse from God in Genesis 3:14-15. God tells the serpent in these verses that it is cursed…among all animals and that it will eat dust for the rest of its life. The text is unclear on whether all other animals were punished for the actions of the serpent, but we know that man's relationship with animals changed after mankind sinned and certainly after the flood.

Animals became first a physical type of provision for mankind and then became a type of symbol for God's spiritual provision for wrongdoing. After Genesis 9:2, animals are given to man for his physical sustenance and well-being. Adam and Eve are physically sustained by animals after God allows them to eat meat. In order for mankind to eat those animals, however, they have to die and suffer. This is a sort of parallel to the symbolic spiritual provision that man is provided by the death of animals. In Genesis 8:20, we see Noah building an altar to God and sacrificing burnt offerings to God using animals. The text doesn't explicitly state why Noah chose to sacrifice these animals, but from subsequent areas in the Bible, we learn that animal sacrifice was often done as a way to praise God or as an act of penitence towards God in order to receive God's forgiveness.

Initially, after Adam and Eve sinned, they recognized that they were naked and covered themselves with fig leaves. After covering themselves with fig leaves, God later covers them with skins. There is a silent spot in the text in the sense that it doesn't say when, where, or how God obtained the skins he used to cover Adam and Eve. A creator God could have simply created the skins. Skin, however, is usually associated with a living creature and therefore it's safe to ask questions of the text. Does the text or the writer want us to assume that God killed an animal or animals to use their skins to cover Adam and Eve? If so, what symbolic implications does such an action provide? If the text were leading us to think that God killed certain animals for their skins to cover Adam and Eve, why would he have done such a thing? Why didn't he allow them to keep the fig leaves as coverings for themselves? If indeed God killed animals or allowed them to die, such an act could be likened to the animal sacrifice that is later seen when Noah sacrifices animals (Genesis 3, 8).

The shedding of an animal's blood for food and its subsequent consumption by man is a symbolic act. When man sheds the blood of an animal and prepares it for food, he is satisfied. In Genesis 8:21, we see that God smells the odor of the animal sacrifice and God is pleased. Although God's pleasure is more concerned with Noah's act of penitence before Him, God's pleasure with the sacrifice almost mirrors the pleasure someone would have after eating a good meal. In a sense, man's physical sustenance by animals that have to die is symbolic of God's sort of appeasement when man sacrifices animals to God as an act of penitence.

Although the Biblical text is not completely clear on why God began to allow man to eat animals, animals play key roles in both man's initial disobedience to God and in God's attempt to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind. The serpent, an animal, initially tempted man and man subsequently disobeyed God by eating from the forbidden tree. After the flood, God allowed man to eat animals and caused animals to fear man. In the end, God's permitting of mankind to eat animals and be physically sustained by them is symbolic of the ways in which God seeks to reestablish a harmonious relationship with mankind.",82.95,75.19,34.89,24.7,7794
English,Report,Undergraduate,"Survival in Auschwitz: Irony, Reality, and Power","It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944, (9) Levi prefaces Survival is Auschwitz with what could be considered either a terribly ironic or completely absurd statement. Indeed, how can one be at all fortunate to be sent to Auschwitz in any given year? However, Levi's thought process is consistent with the mentality that the Nazi's imposed in their management of the Lager. In Survival in Auschwitz, Levi examines the perceptual shifts that occurred among both the inmates and individuals in various positions of power that were necessary for their mental and physical survival. There is a certain sick humor in the Nazis stewardship of Auschwitz, which Levi exposes through various ironies in the novel.

 Arbeit Mact Frei: work gives freedom (22). This slogan appears upon Levi's arrival at the camp. The phrase, so vital that it haunts Levi's dreams (an emotional aside otherwise rare in the work) is ironic in two ways: First, it is clearly a lie. Those entering the camp know that they will likely die and the Germans of course know this for certain. Levi writes, in a few weeks nothing will remain of them but a handful of ashes in some near-by field and a crossed-out number on a register (89). Second, despite the statistical inevitability of death, the inmates go to work anyway each day, even though they could choose to die instantly, at any moment you want you could always go and touch the electric wire-fence (131).

Though the future inmates know that they are being selected for their deaths (sooner or later), and the Nazis are also acutely aware of this fact, the initial selection is conducted with administrative calm, silent as an aquarium (19). How can the Nazis be so emotionally detached? How can the Jews be so quiet? Gone is the German's millennial anger, replaced by an indifferent air… subdued… with a clam assurance of people doing their normal duty of every day. The level of emotional detachment seems almost unreal. Even Levi has difficulty understanding these emotional transformations: man's capacity to dig himself in, to secrete a shell, to build around himself a tenuous barrier of defense, even in apparently desperate circumstances, is astonishing and merits a serious study. It is based on an invaluable activity of adaptation (56). The administrative procedure, the calm, is their shield. Perhaps because Levi is also able to separate his emotions from his writing, he may have an unfortunate but unique ability to understand the Germans.

By warping reality, the Nazis exert their greatest level of control - greater even than physical labor or mental enslavement. They control rationality and reality as a whole. So total is their power that they can create dysreality under the guise of reason.

Levi typifies this with the story of Elias, the dwarf. Elias is ironically best suited for work in the Lager, even though his achondroplasia would have been considered a major disability in the outside world. Levi comments, to imagine Elias as a free man requires a great effort of fantasy (96). Despite the contradictory nature of Elias' prosperity, the Lager is the Nazi's reality. Rules are always subject to change. And since animal law and generalized insanity rule in the Lager, Elias is similarly described as animalistic: you can see every muscle taut under his skin, like a poised animal… a sense of bestial vigor emanates from his body… like a monkey and insane. Yet, in the final irony, since Elias is so fit to work, he is not required to: by the absurd law of the Lager… he practically ceased to work. Even though Elias lives with an obvious genetic defect, he is nonetheless safe from the selections (97-98) that by the Nazi's own dogma of genetic purity should have sent him to the furnace.

In the Lager, Levi shows that it is actually possible to have a good wound (47). Furthermore, Levi was fortunate to spend as much time in the infirmary as he did, since being sick – to a point – equals better health and recovery than staying well. This paradox is compounded by the absurdity of the Germans even having an infirmary in a camp built for death. Indeed, if all the Jews in the camp are to die, then why do the German's even have an infirmary? Why bother? There are countless new prisoners arriving each day to take the ill's place, and the tasks they are assigned to are meaningless, Levi laments, the Buna factory, on which the Germans were busy for four years and for which countless of us suffered and died, never produced a pound of synthetic rubber (73).

Levi himself seems not to fully understand the mental dynamics of the Lager. He reflects during one day of work, it is lucky that it is not windy today. Strange, how in some way one always has the impression of being fortunate (131). Only in Auschwitz, it seems, could one receive a lovingly beating: some of [the Kapos] beat us from pure bestiality and violence, but others beat us when we are under a load almost lovingly. The pinnacle of all ironies, however, is when a man doomed to death from the selection insists on advertising the fact – rather than trying to hide it – in order to get his double ration (129). Moreover, why do the Germans even provide a double ration? This could be a way in which the Germans further exert their power. Perhaps it is another shell to protect what humanity remains in them. Or, perhaps this is another instance of the Nazi's utter insanity.

Given Levi's background as a scientist, it is not unsurprising that he views the Lager as a nearly incomprehensible social experiment (87). His ability to separate emotion from reality is what makes his work so compelling and true, that none of the facts are invented (10). One must wonder if Levi's disposition is due entirely to his scientific background and near-perfect memory, or rather is a product of the Nazi's selection process; that in order to survive, or at least have a small chance of surviving, one had to emulate the Nazi's warped and emotionally disconnected, pathological mentality. Henri, who Levi portrays as being one of the best adapted and certain to survive inmates, is described similarly to the Nazis, enclosed in armor, inhumanly cunning and incomprehensible (100).  However, given the parallel of the ideal survivor's mental traits to that of the Nazis, and Levi's contempt for them, it is not unsurprising that Levi would never want to see Henri – or himself, ultimately – ever again.",0,0,0,0,6442
English,Report,Undergraduate,A compare and contrast paper using two texts from a Science Fiction course,"What does it mean to be a vegetarian? Is it a declaration of animal rights? An attempt to minimize one's ecological impact? Perhaps the next step on the moral ladder in promotion of humanitarian demeanor? Whatever the case, the statistics speak for themselves as the domino effects sparked by the eating of meat embark huge ecological problems across the globe. From a production standpoint, it is much more efficient to produce vegetation than meat as the quantity of resources spent feeding and raising animals devastate the environment. From an ethical standpoint, in selecting vegetarianism, one deters away from innate animalistic tendencies by stoically prioritizing morals over desires. But whatever the reason in choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, there is no doubt that it is ultimately represents as an advanced form of humanitarianism. The choice serves a moral sensibility and commitment to the surrounding world and its creatures. Authors Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells both publicly asserted their confidence in vegetarianism, which is clearly reflected in their work. Shelley's Creature in Frankenstein in addition to Wells's race of Eloi in The Time Machine both uphold vegetarian lifestyles in which both writers call attention to the vegetarian ideal – a moral and ethical obligation humans have to their surroundings.

Shelley's Creature and Wells's Eloi share their differences, however are connected by their vegetarian diet. Through repetition, both authors make their character's vegetarian lifestyle very clear to the reader. This was no accident; both Shelley and Wells were prominent activists of the vegetarian lifestyle. Wells often used vegetarian characters in his novels and The Time Machine was no exception. His novel Utopia was perhaps his most famous meat-eating rebuke as he writes of utopia existing in vegetarian form. Shelley came from a family of vegetarian activists as her father and husband actively published essays encouraging animal rights. Thus, it was no minor detail that Eloi and Creature live vegetarian lifestyles.

In Shelley's Frankenstein, Shelley proposes an interesting juxtaposition: though the Creature is ugly and demon-like in features, he possesses a virtuous character and an astounding intelligence for an uneducated being. Having taught himself to read and then having read Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and The Sorrows of Young Werther during his time as the DeLacy's guest, Shelley makes a point to expound the Creature's intelligence and sophistication (127). Her vast illustration of the Creature's moral and intellectual credibility adds to the cogency of his vegetarianism, as he exists as a being who contemplates the exploitation of others. He remarks to Victor Frankenstein of his vegetarian choice, my food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment (146). The Creature's vegetarianism announces its separation from his creator's moral code by including animals in its moral circle. This inclusion symbolizes the Creature's attempt to exist in human society as he has embraced animals in his. Despite leading an example for moral supremacy, the Creature proves unable to enter human society, finding it to be formed in such a way that both it and animals are omitted from it. The continuing rejections by human beings represent Shelley's paralleling view of the meat-eating society, as human vanity only allows man as his moral center, proving unable to subsume ugly beings or animals. With this in consideration, the Creature's beliefs serve as an emblem for what it desires for and needs but ultimately falls short in receiving from human society. Shelley concludes her novel with bleak hope for her Creature and in doing so, argues for human empathy and a humanitarian obligation to man has to living creatures.

H.G. Wells's race of Eloi share the vegetarian nature of Victor Frankenstein's Creature, but unlike the Creature who asserts his decision to living a vegetarian lifestyle, Eloi's history of vegetarianism remains unclear. What is clear is that common animals used for eating became extinct – potentially from lack of necessity, which points to a societal abandonment of meat. These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians…I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction (44). Though vegetarian in lifestyle, Eloi do not appear to share the same fervor of this decision as Victor's Creature does. In fact, the Time Traveler (TT) describes them as children, carefree and scatterbrained, and in recalling his rescue of Weena, he describes the deficiency in Eloi as none made the slightest attempt to rescue her (59). The lack of fidelity and empathy among Eloi juxtaposes their vegetarian humanism as Wells calls for the necessity in supporting one's comrades. Wells furthers this argument in contrasting Eloi's vegetarianism with the carnivorous Morlocks, whom, the TT eventually discovers, tend to Eloi for the same reasons as a farmer tends to cattle. To the TT this appears grossly inhumane, but Wells neatly parallels Morlocks' consumption of Eloi to our current usage of cattle – gently reminding readers of their own carnivorous behavior. Like Shelley, Wells uses Eloi's lack of devotion to each other and Morlocks' carnivorous behavior to demonstrate his call for man's humanitarian obligation to his surroundings.

In both Frankenstein and The Time Machine, Mary Shelley and H.G. Wells construct arguments for a more morally sensible and responsible society; a society curtailing meat and apathy and heightening empathy and compassion. Using vegetarianism as a symbol of humanitarianism, both authors call for a moral and ethical obligation of man to his surroundings.",0,0,0,0,5813
English,Report,Undergraduate,"""The Franklin's Tale"" and Boccaccio's Il Filocolo","Chaucer used Boccaccio's Il Filocolo as an analogue for the Franklin's Tale, and the stories have a great number of similarities—their basic characters, their basic plot, and their final questions about the characters. But the differences between the two stories show where Chaucer made choices and how they affect the interpretation of the story. They show the issues Chaucer was interested in, and the ideals or morals he was concerned with. Chaucer's changes deal with the social position of the middle class, valuing love versus just honor, and social strictures and appearances, creating a story that invites audience interpretation.

Chaucer has the Franklin tell this tale, a man whose social position differs greatly from Boccaccio's narrator, a noble named Menedon. The Franklin is of the middle class, but wealthy, and attempting to make his way into the nobility through his wealth and actions. This raises the issue of nobility in general—can people only enter this estate through blood connections, or do wealth and character give access? Unlike Boccaccio's tale, which ends with two noble characters, the Queen and Menedon, authoritatively explaining who they think the most liberal is, Chaucer leaves open the possibility for who the most fre is in the Franklin's Tale. He leaves this issue of the source of nobility up for debate.

Both fre and liberal, the adjectives used in the final question posed in each story, have a number of different meanings according to the Middle English Dictionary. In general, their meanings are very similar—being noble, in birth or by character, or being unrestricted in movement or action. (This latter definition can lead to an interesting interpretation of the final question, that may be somewhat different than the standard interpretation of who is the most generous or noble). However, there are also subtle differences between the two definitions that may explain why Chaucer chose to ask about being fre over having great liberalitie. To be fre is to have the social status of a noble or freeman, which is not the same as being nobly born, one of the meanings of liberal. With fre, those who have a high social status because of their wealth and generosity, but are not necessarily nobly born, such as the wealthy middle class, are also included. Other definitions of fre also allow for these non-nobles—those who have a privileged status, and those who possess the rights and privileges of a citizen of a town or city. Liberal does not include these extra variations other than the possibility of being free in general. Interestingly, liberal separates selfless, admirable from generous, while fre just has generous, open-handed in addition to noble in character; noble in appearance. With fre, some of the descriptors from liberal may be included, but are defined as specifically noble attributes. Because of its greater amount of definitions, there is more room for interpretation within the definition of fre.

But before the impact of these words comes into play comes the content of both stories. The characters of each are generally similar, but slightly different in their naming and characteristics. While Boccaccio's tale features an unnamed noble knight with an unnamed noble wife, and another knight, Tarolfo, who is in love with the aforementioned noble woman, Chaucer's includes a named knight and lady, Arveragus and Dorigen, and a squire Aurelius. Boccaccio has an poor old man, Theban, who is an actual magician; Chaucer has a young, unnamed clerk who is a scientist illusionist. These differences in naming point to different emphases of characters in each story. One way to look at it is that those who remain unnamed become characters that represent a generalization of that type of person, leaving them open for more interpretation and general sympathy, whereas named characters are more specific. The two authors' emphases and generalizations are practically opposite, perhaps because of the social positions of the two narrators. The Franklin wants to leave the clerk up for the most sympathy and interpretation, while Menedon favors the nobles. However, interpretation of these naming choices could also be seen in an opposite way, where those unnamed are less sympathetic. This allows for more of a focus to be put on the follies of those who are named and therefore more responsible for their actions.

Chaucer's tale also places much more of an emphasis on the love between Arveragus and Dorigen than Boccaccio's does on the knight and his wife. Arveragus and Dorigen are happily married and live a blissful lyf together (806), and they are so in love that the balance of power in their relationship is even somewhat egalitarian. Dorigen has more freedom than many wives: Arveragus is her servant in love, and lord in mariage (FT V.793). She relates this freedom to her husband's aristocratic rank, and says, sith of youre gentillesse / Ye profre me to have so large a reyne (FT V.754-5). As a result of her happiness with her situation, she swears to be youre humble trewe wyf … till that myn herte breste (FT V.758-9). There is no mention of this sort of love or this equal balance of power within a relationship in Boccaccio's story. Chaucer introduces this type of relationship as a contrast with the relationships of many of the other tales in his work, and to show a type of love possible in a marriage that Boccaccio does not.

Dorigen's love for her husband is apparent from the depression that results when he is away for so long, although her friends tell her that causelees she sleeth hirself (FT V. 825). She does not even enjoy the beautiful May weather and a garden so wonderful that nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys / But if it were the verray paradys (FT V.911-2), but is instead distressed. It is this love which leads her to suggest that getting rid of the rocks on the coast which separate the shore from the sea, and cause so many deaths, would be the one thing for which she could be with another man; removal of the rocks would make her feel closer to her love. But she really says this because she sees it as something impossible—she says it in pley (FT V.988)—as a way to show that under no circumstances will she ever love another man.

There is no such powerful love on the part of the gentlewoman in Boccaccio's tale; he says only that her husband loved her with most loyall love (Boccaccio 1)1. She is merely attempting to stop the other knight from trying to woo her, so he does not end up getting in a fight with her husband, who might hear about his continuing attentions. She, too, makes up a task that is an impossible thing, so that in this sort I shall rid him from me (Boccaccio 2). Her task for Tarolfo, however, has nothing to do with her love for her husband, but actually resembles the garden that Dorigen, truly in love, was unable to enjoy. This garden would be a gift and something that she could conceive no way of actually creating.

Because the women's motivations are different, their reactions to the completion of these impossible tasks are also different. Dorigen does not even go look to see if the rocks are actually gone when Aurelius tells her he has made them disappear—she is just shocked. She wende nevere han come in swich a trappe. / Allas, quod she, that evere this sholde happe! /  For wende I nevere by possibilitee /  That swich a monstre or merveille myghte be!  (FT V.1341-4). She is too distressed by the fact that she might actually have pledged her love to another man to even be interested in seeing the evidence that she so wanted to see earlier, when she looked out on the rocks and meditated how mankynd [they] destroyeth (FT V.876). She values honor greatly, which can be seen by the fact that she decides she must keep her promise, but she also clearly values her love, because she is so distressed about the situation. The fact that it is actually an illusion, and the rocks are not actually gone, makes her distress even more poignant.

The lady in Boccaccio's tale, however, immediately does not believe that Tarolfo has done what she asked, and calmly answers that it pleaseth me right well, ye shall let me see it to morowe (Boccaccio 10). When she does go see the garden, “accompanyed with many others, she enjoys it—there is temperat aire, and she goes around gathering both hearbs and floures (Boccaccio 10). These are hardly the actions of a heartsick, distraught woman. She clearly values honor over love, because she tells Tarolfo ye have deserved me love, and I am ready to stand to my promise (Boccaccio 10); she only become upset about the prospect of having to leave her husband when she returns to her chamber.

Without even looking at the husband's responses and the later actions of the stories, it is clear that Chaucer has introduced a powerful element of love in his story. Dorigen does consider killing herself to best preserve her honor, but ultimately does not do so, allowing for the possibility that her love might prevail. Her husband does not seem to consider love greater than honor, for he lets her go, and although he is very upset because he does love her, he is also extremely concerned with the own social appearances of their relationship. This concern seems to outweigh even Dorigen's life—he forbids her to tell the situation to anyone, up peyne of deeth (FT V.1481). This element of love does perhaps tip the scale in answering the question of who is the most fre at the end in a way that the interpretation of liberalitie in Boccaccio is not affected. The answer to this question really comes down to the values of answerers—is honor, love, or money most important? And if love is so important for Dorigen, then perhaps it is also for Aurelius, and for readers considering the characters.

Aurelius is, indeed, a good man—oon of the beste farynge men on lyve (FT V.932). His love for Dorigen, like Tarolfo's love for the gentlewoman, is enormous, with great good wil (Boccaccio 1). In viewing both tales from a literary standpoint, rather than from a consciousness of social class or an ethical standpoint, Aurelius and Tarolfo are perhaps the most important characters because of the change they undergo throughout the course of the story. They each begin with an extremely selfish desire for a woman who is happily married to another man, which leads them to pester her and do everything they can to try to twist her outrageous promise into something she actually has to keep. But this turns into an understanding of the love woman's love for her husband, and a realization that exhibiting generosity in unbinding the women from the contract—one that they basically forced the women into—is what will make each of them a good person and happiest in the end. The Queen in Boccaccio's version condemns Tarolfo's behavior, because the fact that he was being dishonorable before does not make him more noble than others when he begins to act as a good human being should. Yet this transition should not be condemned. He and Aurelius do suffer in working to find a way to meet the demands of their object of desire, and then once they finally achieve their goals, they almost immediately give it away for the happiness of others. They learn their lessons: Tarolfo learns how honorable a knight really is, and that he should also attempt to be so noble, and Aurelius learns that not only is the knight honorable, but the love bitwix (FT V. 1532) Arveragus and Dorigen is so strong that it would be dishonorable to disrupt it. The differences in these lessons point to the differing values of the tales.

The women of both stories are also each taught a lesson, but it is overtly told to them, and not something they discover within themselves, as Aurelius and Tarolfo did. Those who articulate these lessons differ, however. Aurelius is the one to tell Dorigen, or perhaps just the audience in general, that promises are dangerous: But every wyf be war of hire biheeste! (FT V.1541). However, the knight in Boccaccio is the one to tell his wife to take ye better heed hereafter of such like, although a demanded gift may seeme unto you impossible to be had (Boccaccio 11). By articulating this, Boccaccio's knight is establishing his authority through his superior knowledge and understanding of interaction. But in Chaucer, Aurelius is demonstrating his own learning and self-discovery in reminding Dorigen of her mistake, and in warning others of a future mistake they might make. It becomes less of a reprimand when it comes from someone who himself has made a great moral mistake, but realized it and fixed it.

The weight of this mistake really depends, however, on the validity or power of the oath, which is an issue in both versions of the tale. Before Dorigen makes her promise, she expresses in a sort of oath format that being unfaithful to her husband is not a possibility: By thilke God that yaf me soule and lyf, / Ne shal I nevere been untrewe wyf / In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit (FT V. 983-5). But her promise to Aurelius also seems to be in the language of an oath, although it begins with in pleye thus seyde she: (FT V.988). She makes her promise by the authority of heighe God above (FT V. 989), and ends with Have heer my trouthe, in al that evere I kan (FT V.998). And predating these two oaths is her original marriage oath. Which of these oaths reigns supreme? The characters in the story seem to conclude that the oath that is given the most recently has the most power. In Chaucer, there is no overt discussion of the actual lawfulness of this later oath that Dorigen gives after two other oaths confirming her loyalty to her husband.

The question of lawfulness does become an issue in Il Filocolo. The gentlewoman's promise may be less of an oath, although she does say that if Tarolfo he completes what she wishes, she sware by her gods, and by that loyalty that ought to be in a gentlewoman, that she would accomplish al his desire (Boccaccio 2). However, the Queen says in her interpretation at the end of the tale that the wife could not justly make such an oth, without the will of her husband (Boccaccio 16), or if she did so, as the story shows her to have done, it was not lawful. So in this case, it actually turns out that the oath was non-binding, and the knight's act of giving his wife to Tarolfo just came from his own personal sense of honor. The knight and his lady's original marriage oath is here the most powerful.

In the viewpoint of the queen in Boccaccio's story, the fact that the oath was not lawful makes the knight's actions even more honorable than they had been otherwise, because his personal honor extends beyond the law. This could also be interpreted as the knight acting very stupidly, and giving up more than is necessary in order to prove some inflated sense of honor. Because the question of lawfulness does not come up in Chaucer, the issue of which oath is more powerful goes along with the issue of which virtue is more valued—honor or love. If love is the most valued, then Dorigen's love for her husband, represented by her marriage oath and claim that she will never be untrue to him, have more weight than her rash promise to Aurelius. If honor is more valued, then the fact is that technically Dorigen did make an oath the Aurelius, and must live with the consequences. Aurelius, who values love, ultimately realizes that if he truly does value love, he must honor the love between Dorigen and Arveragus.

One character in both versions that does not have much connection with love or honor at all themselves are the clerk and magician that helped Aurelius and Tarolfo. Although Theban did perform actual magic, where the clerk just created an illusion, they both fulfilled the contract by doing what was asked of them. The clerk and Theban also both acknowledge the honorable actions being made by others, and the clerk in Chaucer's tale asserts his own generosity and level of nobility much more forcefully than Theban.

Theban acknowledges how liberal the knight was to Tarolfo and how generous Tarolfo was to him in return, and sees it as simply his due to also be so generous. But he also puts himself into his place as a poor member of the lower class serving a knight when he says for above all things in the world it contenteth me, in that I have served thy turne (Boccaccio 13). He seems to not care about the money, which is not valued in this tale, and is happy to go back to his life of poverty and herb-collecting, a decision which the queen asserts is wise, because poverty is much calmer and safer than being rich (Boccaccio 19). The clerk in Chaucer, however, does not want to submit to the restrictions and stereotypes of a lower class. He says, Thou art a squier, and he is a knyght; / But God forbede, for his blisful myght, / But if a clerk koude doon a gentil dede, / As wel as any of yow, it is no drede! (FT V.1609-12). He is interested in being seen on the same level as the nobility in terms of his actions, as the Franklin himself is. There is no condemnation of the value of money or getting paid for completing a contract in the Franklin's Tale as there is in Boccaccio's tale.

Indeed, since the Franklin is narrating his tale, Chaucer has him put his own agenda into the story. The tale ends with the Franklin questioning the audience about who they think is the mooste fre (FT V.1622), but is followed by no epilogue or prologue to another tale in which this question is discussed by the pilgrims. It is left completely open, up to interpretation and debate by the audience reading it, as it would have been up to debate among the pilgrims listening to it. It has no suggested interpretation in favor of the aristocrat-born characters.

This level of openness fits well with the overall message coming from the beginning of the Canterbury Tales, starting from the Miller's Prologue, when Chaucer tells the audience, And therefore, whoso list it nat yheere, / Turne over the leef and chese another tale (MTPr I.317-8). Just as readers can choose to read in whatever order they want from these tales, of which today scholars are still uncertain of the exact intended ordering, they can choose who they think is the most fre, based on their own background and experience. Chaucer updates the story from Boccaccio's tale, which had some discussion provided at the end, but with a final conclusion in favor of honor. He makes it into something more progressive and asking for intelligent thought from readers. Comparing Chaucer's tale to Boccaccio's original makes apparent Chaucer's agenda and achievement.",0,0,0,0,18612
English,Report,Undergraduate,Cursed Inheritances,"In Go Down, Moses, William Faulkner represents many different problems of inheritance. Complicating this inheritance is the conflict between the inheritance of land and the inheritance of knowledge that affects how one views said land and even how one views family history. Though Isaac disinherits the family land and largely separates himself from society, it is his own inability to disinherit the family secrets that drives him to relative isolation. For McCaslin, accepting ownership of the land is something he feels compelled to do despite the fact that he shares much of Isaac's knowledge about family history and actually witnessed slavery directly.

As a child, Cass observes slavery firsthand under the tutelage of his uncles Buck and Buddy. It is his perspective which the reader sees in Was. The events that occur here are later recounted to Isaac by Cass, which is illustrative of the fact that Isaac receives information about slavery and his own family secondhand. It is also clear that Cass was raised to think of the land as his, as General Compson later remarks in The Bear that Cass has one foot straddled into a farm and the other foot straddled into a bank (Faulkner 240). He observes injustice and hardship and reacts in a pragmatic manner, realizing that nothing is to be gained by refusal of the family land despite its marred history. This is nearly the opposite of Isaac's eventual reaction, which sets up the cousins as representatives of two very different ethical ideals.

It is clear that the relationship between Cass and Isaac is much different from that of typical cousins. Due to the age difference, McCaslin is more his brother than his cousin and more his father than either (158). Cass has clearly had a significant role in Isaac's upbringing in the absence of Isaac's own father. McCaslin brought him for the first time to the camp, the big woods, just as Cass himself was brought to the woods to learn about hunting and the wilderness from Sam Fathers (184). Cass's experience bears great resemblance to Isaac's experience on the face of it, but Cass is not nearly as affected by the bear or seeing the mystical buck as is Isaac.

Isaac and McCaslin are both educated in nature by Sam Fathers, but for Isaac this contributes to his eventually refusal to accept the family land. He comes to believe that land cannot be owned; instead, land is something owned by God and shared by all. During his argument with McCaslin, he says the land was never [his] to repudiate (Faulkner 245). The importance of this moment is highlighted in the very first pages of the book, when Isaac is introduced as having given up his inheritance because the earth was no man's but all men's (4). It is here where a clear distinction is drawn between Isaac and McCaslin. They are juxtaposed not against the wilderness but against the tamed land which was to have been [Isaac's] heritage (243).

Part of this juxtaposition results simply from an age difference. With regards to the turmoil following the Civil War, McCaslin had actually seen it, and the boy even at almost eighty would never be able to distinguish certainly between what he had seen and what had been told him (278). Because of his unique position, Isaac interprets nearly everything he sees and comes to his own conclusions about the past, whereas Cass is, from the beginning, more closely connected to his heritage. Though they both might have the same knowledge of the family secrets, Isaac has a clear, strong reaction, but it is not apparent that Cass reacts at all.

This potential for shared knowledge is realized through the presence of the ledgers. It can be inferred that Cass may have tried to prevent Isaac from discovering them, as Isaac got the commissary key from McCaslin's room after midnight while McCaslin was asleep in order to read them (257). Isaac is always alone when he peruses the ledgers, as though he does not want McCaslin to know what he has discovered. This leads the reader to believe that Cass is aware of the dark family secrets revealed in the old record books, as it makes sense that this would be a secret he would want hidden from a sixteen-year-old Isaac. It would seem, however, that Cass is eventually aware that Isaac has knowledge of the ledgers' content.

Isaac and Cass appear to have a mutual understanding of their shared knowledge of the history contained in the ledgers. The ledgers are referenced, albeit silently, several distinct times during their confrontation over the inheritance. Early on in the argument, the ledgers are mentioned as something neither Cass nor Isaac look towards, as though they are both familiar with the contents and thus do not need to pay them another glance (250). Later, McCaslin did not even say Look but merely lifted one hand, not even pointing, not even specifically towards the shelf of ledgers but towards the desk (279). This is finally connected to the land as a whole:

McCaslin merely lifted one hand, not even speaking and not even toward the ledgers: so that, as the stereopticon condenses into one instantaneous field the myriad minutia of its scope, so did that slight and rapid gesture establish in the small cramped and cluttered twilit room not only the ledgers but the whole plantation in its mazed and intricate entirety – the land, the fields and what they represented…that whole edifice intricate and complex and founded upon injustice and erected by ruthless rapacity and carried on even yet with at times downright savagery…not only still intact but enlarged, increased; brought still intact by McCaslin (284-285).

For both Cass and Isaac, the ledgers represent their entire family history, good and bad. This history is passed on in the very land itself, the ugliness living on through McCaslin and eventually his descendants. Cass seems to understand this history, to have an idea of exactly what information is contained in the ledgers, but if he does possess this knowledge it does not seem to affect him as it does Isaac. Accepting his heritage is what Cass sees as the ethical thing to do, not necessarily in spite of but perhaps because of his family history. The act of refusing the land for Isaac, however, represents his attempts to wash his hands of the family secrets.

Isaac attempts to renounce his inheritance by not accepting the family land, but he cannot disinherit his own family history. Though his beliefs about nature and property clearly play into his refusal of his inheritance, it is also clear that Isaac is strongly affected by his reading of the ledgers. Though Isaac knows from his own observation and memory that there had already been some white in Tomey's Terrel's blood before his father gave him the rest of it, he is stricken by the actual evidence of this (259). He is not able to make peace with his grandfather Carothers McCaslin's horrific act of incest, but renouncing his inheritance does not erase this knowledge from his mind. The only thing his actions really accomplish is the elimination of the McCaslin surname from the plantation, as the family itself lives on through McCaslin Edmonds. This leads to the conclusion that, if this knowledge is shared by Cass, it is something he accepted and moved beyond, but this inherited secret proves to be the sticking point for Isaac.

Cass and Isaac's different interpretations and reactions to family history are rooted in Cass's observations at the end of The Old People. Isaac is shamed by the actions of his family members, and shame is the one thing worse than not being alive (179). Isaac absorbs the family history and personalizes it, and is then so horrified by it that he must escape it. Cass, however, seems to believe that even the darkest moments cannot be hidden – he points to the seed, the acorns, at what happens even to carrion when you try to bury it: it refuses too, seethes and struggles too until it reaches light and air again (179). History will persist without the consent of either Cass or Isaac, and Cass is resigned to his familial duty in order to have a say in how this occurs. As a descendant of Carothers McCaslin, Cass sees himself as tied to both the legacy of the family and of the land itself. Despite the efforts made by Isaac to stop progress, his repudiation of the land means that this is not up to him. Only those who control the land can play a role in shaping it, and Cass is able to accomplish this to a certain extent by providing a house for Lucas and Mollie. It is Cass who is ultimately responsible for any progress, but unlike Isaac he does not necessarily see the perpetuation of the family line as shameful. Instead, he accepts his inheritance and does his best not to simply continue the family legacy but to improve it. In the end, however, because the family history is so tied to the land, Isaac cannot truly escape the legacy of the plantation or disinherit his family secrets, either. He is part of the curse of the South, which is something Cass appears to understand. Cass remarks, I am what I am; I will be always what I was born and have always been (286). They will always be connected to their family's former slaves, and though they might deny the truth in the end they must live with this knowledge.

Isaac and Cass's very different reactions to the inheritance of the land highlight the problem of inherited knowledge. Cass, as a childhood witness to slavery, is able to accept the family land despite its curse. In some ways, Cass accepts the land because it is cursed, because he knows he is forever tied to the history of the plantation and thus cannot ethically refuse what is rightfully his. Isaac, who obtains most of his knowledge about slavery from Cass and Sam Fathers and his reading of the ledgers, has a more detached view of the subject. By virtue of his generational removal from family history, Isaac is more burdened by both his inheritance of land and his inheritance of family secrets. The overarching legacy of slavery which frames the novel as a whole is highlighted by Isaac's reaction. It is, finally, the inherited curse which perhaps cannot be overcome, no matter how hard future generations may try.",0,0,0,0,10165
English,Report,Undergraduate,Fairy Tales and the Context of Disney,"For most Americans, Walt Disney's animated versions of fairy tales are the most familiar. In Breaking the Disney Spell, literature critic Jack Zipes defines Disney as both a revolutionary and an unfortunate interpreter of fairy tales. Zipes highlights Disney's successes and shortcomings as part of a larger discussion of the social implications of fairy tales and the idea of the child as the target audience. Zipes is generally a Marxist critic, focusing on the role literary fairy tales had in separating people by wealth and education status. For Zipes, fairy tales and folk tales reflect the values of a society, and his essay clearly demonstrates an attempt to place fairy tales within their social and historical context while specifically highlighting the effects of fairy tales as designed by Walt Disney.

Zipes defines the folk tale as an oral story intended to explain natural occurrences and bring people together (333). This places the folk tale securely in the realm of the community, as stories are passed down from generation to generation without written record. In this way, storytelling was the product of communal efforts, and folk tales thus reflected the values of an entire society and provided a means to teach those values to children. The invention of the printing press and the rise of literary folk tales, Zipes argues, resulted in sanitized versions of traditional tales for children, although fairy tales were not deemed entirely appropriate for children until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (336). For a time, then, the printing press actually decreased the accessibility of fairy tales to children. Furthermore, these printed texts were generally accessible only to the wealthy (336). This resulted in an overall shift in how fairy tales were received and understood:

We have already seen that one of the results stemming from the shift from the oral to the literary in the institutionalization of the fairy tale was a loss of live contact with the storyteller and a sense of community or commonality. This loss was a result of the social-industrial transformations at the end of the nineteenth century (341).

What was once a oral, communal activity became more heavily focused upon the private realm, although oral traditions did continue to an extent (335). These two divergent traditions resulted in a greater social schism, as the literary fairy tale was reserved for the elite and the oral folk tale largely became a tradition of the lower classes. As Zipes argues, however, industrialization itself was not completely negative, as literary rates spread and the standard of living generally improved (341). Still, Zipes maintains that there was a significant difference between the two traditions.

Part of Zipes's argument relies on the supposition that there was a great thematic difference between oral folk tales and literary fairy tales. The ruling classes, who printed and read fairy tales, could instill notions of elitism and separatism through a select canon of tales geared to children who knew how to read (337). This argument holds in the sense that the tales as read by children were cleaned up by editors like the Brothers Grimm, while the oral tales retained much of their original darkness. What is not clear, however, is whether this sanitation resulted in vastly different moral and social lessons. It would seem, though, that social and industrial changes resulted in a shifting purpose for fairy tales. No matter the overall content, the fairy tale has evolved alongside technology. Zipes argues that technology was the fuel for Walt Disney's reinvention of the fairy tale, and with that reinvention came a new set of functions and moral lessons.

Zipes praises Disney as a revolutionary, someone who dared to carve new paths in the worlds of both animation and fairy tales (343). Disney reinterpreted fairy tales and played into the core of American mythology, as is evident through his use of the infantile quest (345). Because he brought fairy tales to the masses through the use of animation, fairy tales could once more be enjoyed by children, and in the decades since Disney's first film, fairy tales have been reinstated firmly in the realm of children's entertainment.

For Disney, the story of Snow White presented many opportunities to present his own ideas about what America should be. Unlike the prince in the source material, Disney's Prince frames the overall narrative (349). It is the Prince who demonstrates the values of valor and wealth and who emerges as the hero who saves Snow White (350). Snow White herself is heavily domesticated, a perfect example of femininity for scores of young female viewers. Snow White also reflects the time period in which it was made, as the seven dwarfs exemplify the work ethic and American spirit that would be necessary for recovery from the Great Depression.

Zipes does criticize Walt Disney's focus on the commercial prospects of fairy tales. Zipes discusses Disney's refusal to credit his animators, a sign that he always needed to be in charge and put his own stamp on his projects. Disney also used technology not to fully reinstate the fairy tale as a story of the community, but rather to highlight his own ingenuity and spread his own messages about gender roles and the importance of maintaining a patriarchal society (352). Because of this, Disney was not quite successful in returning the fairy tale to the realm of the community. Though his stories could be viewed by the masses, they retained many of the same value messages as the earlier literary fairy tales.

Jack Zipes argues that fairy tales should be accessible to everyone, especially children, but his desire that fairy tales should not unnecessarily stratify society leads to his complex evaluation of Walt Disney. Disney's interpretations of fairy tales, though innovative, are not completely successful in Zipes's opinion, as they reinforce ideas of patriarchy, social status, and gender roles that have little place in our modern world.

English,Report,Undergraduate,Limited Recovery: Trauma in Obejas' Cuban America,"I have done that, says my memory. I cannot have done that, says my pride, and remains adamant. At last – memory yields.

-Friedrich Nietzsche

Juani Las Casas exhibits many trademark symptoms associated with trauma victims. Comparing her narrative with a more general psychological account of victims' responses is useful: it gives us a guiding light into some of Juani's more perplexing behavior, and it offers forth a tried-and-true solution for healing. Yet, looking at Juani's trauma reveals more than just a simple cause and effect relationship between events in her life and her respective emotional responses. We get an incredibly troubling picture of Cuban-American life as deeply pathological, perhaps insurmountably so for an individual like Juani who, one would assume, wants to heal and move on. Jimmy, who's arguably the perpetrator of trauma against Juani, is not just a one-dimensional villain. Though his childhood makes him no less morally culpable for any of his actions, his back story inspires some degree of sympathy – or, if not sympathy, then understanding – for his abuses. He, too, is, in a way, a trauma victim. The problem for Juani, like any trauma victim, is that she must find some semblance of moral solidarity before she can make amends with her trauma. Unfortunately, the majority of the Cuban-in-exile culture offers little sympathy for her plight, with the perhaps-satisfactory exception of her cousin, Patricia

Trauma victims behave predictably, engaging in behavior that, throughout psychology's history, has been deemed madness or hysteria. In the late 19th century, Freud and Janet undertook, in a scientific manner, to understand why women were acting out, at seemingly random times, extreme versions of fear, irritability, helplessness, memory loss, and alterations of normal physiological functions.1 The two found overwhelming evidence that certain traumatic events had, in a way, triggered the hysteria. Often, in the case of women, the trauma was associated with sexual violations perpetrated by men.2

Both Freud and Janet began to realize that, following a traumatic sexual encounter, a process of personality splitting – or as Janet termed it, dissociation – occurred. The logic of dissociation is as follows: after a traumatic event, the traumatized victim is unable to comprehend, or to keep intact in a normal state of consciousness, the memories and feelings of the trauma.3 That is, the trauma is so overwhelming, that the victim must compartmentalize and set aside the feelings in a separate consciousness, or an unconscious. Freud wrote that the origin of all psychopathologies lies in the contents of the unconscious, or that part of our soul – if you will – that is split apart from our normally developing and maturing self.4 One can think of it like a rotting piece of meat hidden in a closet with small vents; the meat's stench will, for the most part, go unnoticed, but with a large enough gust of wind, the vents will allow forth wafts of the stench. And as time goes on, the meat's stench gets worse and worse, though it is still hidden.

The therapist's job, according to psychological dictate, is to uncover the rot – to bring it out into the light so the individual can realize what has been causing the stench. Leaving this somewhat putrid metaphor behind, we see that what Freud and his contemporaries realized is that by unearthing trauma, by putting the traumatic narrative into words, patients' hysterical symptoms were alleviated.5 Later in the 20th century, social workers working with ex-soldiers from World War II and Vietnam came to the same conclusion.6 Putting into words the trauma narrative, however, does not exorcise the trauma; rather, it is to come to grips with the trauma's reality, and to reintegrate it into the individual's life narrative. By accepting the traumatic narrative, it is no longer relegated to the dark portions of consciousnesses, and is no longer able to wreak the same unpredictable and destructive effects as before.7 (Thus, the meat metaphor is a bit inept, for in order to heal requires acceptance of the trauma – or rot – into one's conscious life, and surely no one would like to accept rotten meat as a reality. Most would throw it out, which is not the therapeutic goal.)

However, victims often prevent themselves the benefit of healing out of pride. Such is the case, it seems, for Juani Las Casas. The evidence of Juani's trauma is not only spelled out in the reiteration of her violent encounter with Gina, but is all-too-evident in her problematic behavior after the fact. After the violence – or incident, as her relatives call it – Jimmy's fabricated story denies Juani the cathartic experience of truth-telling. Of course, she always could have told the truth, yet she recognizes the comfort entailed in lying: In my own way, I relished the lies, and I was secretly relieved to not be responsible to them. 8 Yet, why should this be comfortable? Herman writes that not only does speaking about trauma force the witness to share in pain 9(and so Juani may believe she is actually protecting her family), but more importantly, when it occurs to an already-devalued person, such as a woman or child, speaking about the trauma is outside of socially accepted reality. To make the trauma public is unacceptable, and therefore, the traumatic narrative becomes unspeakable.10 For Juani, this is further evidenced by the interaction she has with her mother when, almost pleadingly, she tries to prepare her mother for the fact that Jimmy's story is a lie. Don't torture yourself with this … there are some things that are better left unspoken, 11Mami says. With her mother, the figure in one's life who is said to be the most understanding and nurturing, Juani has no real outlet to share her pain. In fact, Mami actually recommends that Juani bottle up her feelings, as though this were the more healthy way of coping. The fact is, Juani doesn't feel at ease enough with any of her family members, at least initially. She considers herself an outsider to her own blood.12

Thus, Juani, denied the ability to represent her trauma in words, begins to develop what therapists would consider to be symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. After the violence, she writes that I was incapable of focusing on anything, and so jumpy I was constantly startled, constantly irritated. 13 In a moment of rancor, she assails her mother for her supposed falsification of the cinta magnetica story. Even the language of the descriptions implies a sort of violence – the words like bullets piercing my mother. 14 Though, for Nena and Bernie, the phone conversation could have been mistaken as a bout of purposeless malice, psychological theory may have it otherwise:

Traumatic events call into question basic human relationships. They breach the attachments of family, friendship, love, and community. They shatter the construction of the self that is formed and sustained in relation to others … she often comes into conflict with important people in her life. There is a rupture in her sense of belonging within a shared system of belief.15 

So, the bullets of her speech are not aimed at Mami's feelings; rather they are the symbolic destruction of whatever attachment she had to her mother's values. This conversation, less of an outright attack, is more of a symbolic measure of distancing herself from her mother who she believes, like everyone else in the family, is a liar.16 The fight is a way for Juani to prove to herself that her healing and satisfaction with truth will not arrive through her mother.

Another obvious sign of Juani's PTSD symptoms is the moment when she realizes that she has confused her own understanding of the violence with Gina. Having kept a journal as a way of recording her personal narrative, she discovers that she has begun to insert fragments of Jimmy's lie into her journal. The journal, which is nearly an analogue of a therapist – it is a safe spot to record her unmediated thoughts without consequence – somehow becomes tainted. Yet, this is not a surprising event for a trauma victim. While denying reality may seem crazy to both an outsider and to the victim herself, facing reality can be more difficult. Trauma victims often present inconsistent or factually incorrect versions of their trauma narrative either to themselves or to others as a way of coping with the unthinkable.17 Fragmented stories or notions of reality are functions of dissociative disorders. It's easy to imagine that any victim of trauma or suffering would prefer to live in an artificial or imaginary world – prisoners, sexual abuse victims, and holocaust survivors alike. Better that than live with reality.

From all of her psychological and emotional suffering, it would seem easy for the outsider to say to Juani, You have suffered, and many others have suffered, and you must do what is necessary to heal; you must come clean with your story to a therapist, or whomever else would offer a safe place to speak the truth, and begin your life again in acceptance of truth. Yet, as Herman notes, it's not only the immediate people around you who dictate whether it is socially valid to verbalize the trauma. Politics and their associated gendered structures of power, too, constrain individuals from seeking help and verbalizing their trauma narratives.18 In Freud's time, women were ridiculed for telling the truth about their suffered abuses, and because of this, often kept quiet.19 War veterans, too, presumably fearing emasculation among their veteran peers, kept quiet. Yet, certain political movements have, throughout recent history, begun to legitimize speaking about these traumas. With the powerful anti-war movement in the 1970s, veterans' psychological trauma became an acceptable public discourse. The political movement gave legitimacy not only to sufferers to voice their trauma, but to the field of mental health, which became less constrained by social norms to continue developing and researching healing methods.20

Unfortunately, the Cuban-American political climate that Juani faces is not hospitable to open gayness. As Bernie says, The independista movement doesn't do well with lesbian and gay issues … they just think homosexuality's a product of a capitalist society. This attitude is one to which Gina adheres, as well. She considers sexual identity to be a white, capitalist-bourgeois construction, unworthy of contemplation alongside any human concerns. She even goes so far as to accuse Juani – and all of the Cubans in America – of wanting to be white.21 What begins as an attack on her sexuality ends with a sweepingly prejudiced statement about nationality and ethnicity. These political-sexual divisions underlay much of the tension in the scene right before their quarrel, as perhaps Obejas is trying to persuade us that ideology and politics are an insurmountable obstacle to love. Perhaps perhaps is too light of a word, as Juani says it herself: I know all too well how the world of politics, with its promises and deceptions, its absolute values and impersonal manifestos, can cut through the deepest love and leave lovers stranded. 22

Yet, if making amends (or failing to) with both her own Cuban culture's homophobia and her lover's homophobia is a struggle, Juani is subject to a much larger and more grotesque set of prejudices in Jimmy. Jimmy is an interesting character, for he engenders both Cuban machismo and Americanized anti-Cubanisms. Jimmy, like Juani, is an outsider – both to mainstream white Americans and to the Cuban immigrants.23 His identity lies somewhere in the void between the two, giving him his distanced Frankstein-like personality. Unlike Juani, who, though suffering, is able to come to recognize and accept her outsider status, Jimmy spends energy trying to compensate for his lack of a regular upbringing. As Juani's father begins anew on his duct tape tale, Jimmy listens attentively, as though listening to his own father, and consumes the story without doubt.24 Perhaps it is only a kind or ingratiating gesture, but from what the Las Casas sisters presume, Jimmy is, in fact, trying to find a paternal figure.

For all of his efforts to fit in, to find a surrogate, ethnically appropriate father, it seems that Jimmy's hostility toward Juani is born out of bitterness; bitterness because she has had the luxury to be born into her own culture and customs, yet, perhaps as he sees it, she throws them away and opts for her own outsider status. This would explain the pathological power dynamic between the two of them. Their relationship is one which could be characterized as an unpublicized war: That first time she left us alone in the living room … Jimmy just sat there on the couch and stared at me, his legs wide open, his hand rubbing his dick … it was like a stand-off. 25 Throughout the novel, Jimmy mixes aggression with overt male sexuality, in a way that's suggestive of a certain machismo dominance. The penis becomes a symbolic weapon that he uses to threaten Juani, at one point simultaneously stroking himself and ordering her not to visit Caridad anymore.26 The stiff phallus become synonymous with his intimidating physical violence, sending Juani the message that should she disobey him, she will await a crime much worse than anything he inflicts on his wife. In one scene, Obejas juxtaposes his overly macho intimidation technique in the laundry shop with his receiving a letter from his cousin – his blood family for whom he shows very little sympathy or care. At one moment, we have the simultaneous over-the-top display of machismo and a melancholy reminder of his fractured past. Obejas may use this juxtaposition to indicate that Jimmy's mixture of violence and sexuality is a pathological stand-in for a (lack of) personal and national identity. In a way, his pathologies suggest a profound trauma in childhood, one which is understandable given his lack of biological parentage.

However, his trauma is not self-suffered. Jimmy's pathologies precipitate the coercive oppression he inflicts on Juani, binding her to her own trauma, too. This aforementioned bitterness he feels toward her manifests in the faux-protective fabrication he doles out to the unsuspecting family members. His behavior indicates a sort of war of trauma victims – as though by chaining Juani to an inescapable silence, he has a claim to victory, not to mention a falsely inflated ego predicated on the belief that he has saved her. His behavior matches up with how Herman describes the traditional behavior of the persecutor: In order to escape accountability for his crimes, the perpetrator does everything in his power to promote forgetting. 27 Like the Nazis burning their evidence of the concentration camps, Jimmy prevents the true story from reaching the concerned family ears. The power to control both what others believe and what Juani, pathologically, comes to believe for herself in her journal, is indeed a formidable power. Additionally, Jimmy's power is one which stunts Juani's ability to heal. Trauma already strips the victim of her sense of self-control28, but Jimmy's maneuverings go even further, stripping her of self-knowledge and making it impossibly difficult to tell the already-difficult truth to her family.

The novel's final scene is troubling because of it's content; it's also troubling because it seems to suggest that Juani's release from self-captivity – her freedom to make amends with Gina and finally come out with the truth to Titi (and surely Patricia, too)29 – can only come at the expense of Jimmy's being beaten. Whether Jimmy's beating is merely correlated to her renewed sense of self, or whether it actually causes it is a moot point. What's important to note is the disturbing idea that Obejas presents, that only through an act of extreme violence to the oppressor will trauma's yoke release. Psychotherapists would have it otherwise, claiming that the revenge fantasy is an empty joy. No trauma victim, according to theory and practice, would be able to have a sudden turnaround from self-dispossession to moderate serenity after been witness to more violence. Retaliation against the perpetrator does not move the victim along a healing path. Healing starts with regaining a sense of safety, moving to the acceptance of remembering and mourning, and finally to the point of reconnecting with ordinary life.30 It's a dire, if not psychologically refutable way to envision violence as the first step to heal traumatic wounds.

Perhaps, however, the novel does not end on some kind of polar-good or bad note. The tone certainly projects a sense of mild warmth, of limited happiness. It looks toward healing, rather than suggesting that healing has already occurred. In fact, Juani takes one of the very first steps toward recovery: drafting the trauma narrative, literally, to her aunt. Gina, too, provides closure for Juani, apparently having already achieved some limited version of it for herself.31

But we're left with a vision of Cuban-American culture that's deeply troubling. The vision may extend to all cultures-in-exile in America, of which there are many, and may explain some of the subtle pathologies that permeate the American social fabric. It's not only Jimmy, whose not-so-unique childhood leaves him in a traumatic vacuum, out of which arises violent pathologies. No, throughout the novel we encounter numerous examples of hysteria. Juani's father, Gina explains, is delusional simply from being an exile. He, like Juani, vacillates in his stories, appearing crazy to outsiders to the point that they're incredulous, laughing inside the entire time 32 that he speaks. It seems that he suffers from the same dissociative symptoms, his skewed reality a stand-in for the trauma of having lost his homeland. While reflecting on the fact that her father prefers to ignore her troubling outsider sexual identity rather than face the truth, she says that his preference for lies is representative of the whole family's preferences.33 What we see is a collective dissociation. This means that an entire group of people, unwilling to face reality's pains, lives in an artificial reality. Janet and Freud saw that, on an individual level, people tended to act out in extremely pathological ways after dissociation had occurred; yet, what would this mean for an entire group living in a dissociated state?

Obejas doesn't answer the question in a rigorous, academic/sociological way, but rather shows us a family and its friends, torn apart at times by acts of horrendous violence, political disputes, memory lapses, and disagreements about what really is or was reality. Even more troubling is to think, at least for a moment, about the fact that the novel begins in the present tense after Juani's trauma has already occurred. This presents some challenges to narrative authenticity, for she already admits that her journal's reality had become blurred. What other parts of the novel, as a whole, could have become disfigured by unreality? And who are we really to trust?

The only satisfying answer to the question is found in the text itself. When Juani asks Nena how she has explained the family's stories to Bernie, Nena replies, Well, I just tell Bernie what's true for me … and that there are varying stories. To assume that there is no concrete truth to which individuals can refer, however, is indeed a troubling picture for classic psychoanalysis.",0,21.8,18.28,7.32,19515
English,Report,Undergraduate,The Words of Love Between Us: The Covenant in Hosea,"The book of Hosea reaffirms the first word of the covenant between God and Israel at Sinai: I am YHWH your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods besides me(Ex 20:2-3). At a time when the Assyrian empire is threatening like a flood to overwhelm them, and they are desperately thinking of ways to save themselves—turning to other gods, making covenants with other peoples—Hosea urges the people of Israel to remember that they are YHWH's people, and his alone, and as such they are to look to no other for deliverance. He reaches back to the book of Exodus to find a time when, according to the view of this text, Israel truly knew YHWH. In what's seen as a wooing of Israel the bride by YHWH the bridegroom, the God in Hosea will call his people back into the wilderness—a state of total dependence upon God, and a place in which the people entered into a covenant with their God after he freed them from slavery—so that they may come to know him anew before returning to the land, a theme which would touch the hearts of those later listeners who were exiled in Babylon:

Therefore, I will now allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. From there I will give her her vineyards, and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she shall respond as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt. (Hos2:14-15)

Through this conceit, he recasts the first word of the covenant as a call to an exclusive love relationship with God/YHWH. This idea of the covenant as a marriage is of profound importance to Hosea, as he urges the people to come to truly know YHWH. For just as in Exodus, the source of the obligation to monogamy is the God's declaration of who he is, and how they are to know him: I am YHWH your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery […] Hosea's God is a God who loves, and a God who frees; he is YHWH, he is their God, and he is the one who set them free. And so Israel's obligations to her God are not those of a slave to a master; rather, they are the obligations of love, the promises of the marriage covenant which she entered into with the God who freed her, and who promised her steadfast love.

So in the wilderness of Hosea, just as in the wilderness of Exodus, God tries to break the slave mentality which 400 years of bondage in Egypt put upon the heart of Israel; he urges the people to imagine themselves as free (Williams lecture, 2-11). In the book of Hosea, this means even urging the people to see their relationship with him in a new light, or rather one long forgotten, to be sought and found anew. That is, the book of Hosea appeals to the people of Israel, not only to put away their worship of other gods, but to find a new understanding of their relationship with their own God, YHWH. And this new understanding is to be found in the names by which they are to know him:

On that day, says YHWH, you will call me, 'Ishi' (my man, my husband) and no longer will you call me, 'Baali' (my master, my Baal.) (Hos 2:16)

The change of names here reflects a whole new experience of the relationship with God on Israel's part; it expresses the new way in which she is to know him—as husband, and not as master. Both names have layers of meaning which beg each to be given a closer look.

First, Baal. On the surface, it is the name of the Canaanite god whose worship in the northern kingdom Israel is the very adultery for which God punishes her, withdrawing from her the fruits of the land, and later sweeping her away. For in the marriage metaphor of this text, to worship other gods is to know other lovers, and to not know YHWH at all. And so to come to a true understanding of their relationship with YHWH, they must first put away all foreign gods. God goes on to say: For I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more (Hos 2:17). That is to say, with the removal of the name Baal, Baal will be forgotten, just as YHWH was forgotten when Israel called upon other lovers1. The loss of the names of the Baals reflects the loss of Israel's knowledge of them, just as when sometime lovers drift apart, and the once familiar names rust upon the tongue.

But the name works even further within the marriage metaphor. For it is not just a matter of which god Israel knows, YHWH or Baal; it is even a matter of what name Israel knows her God by within their own relationship. God's words are: ""You will call me 'My Ish,' and no longer will you call me, 'My Baal'(Hos 2:16). This clearly seems to say that Israel knew God/YHWH as Baal, and called him by that name; and YHWH wants nothing of it.

This brings one to the inner layer of meaning of the name Baal, the meaning it has within the relationship between YHWH and his people. Baal can colloquially mean husband, just like ish. But its literal meaning is master, and it can never be wholly severed from its connotations with this servant-lord relationship, not any more than it can be from its connotations with the worship of foreign gods. It would seem then that God, in removing the name of Baal from their mouths, is given to reject this idea of the relationship between him and his people, and to urge them to look upon it with new eyes. It would seem that God is urging his people to see him not as a master in servitude, but as a partner in love.

And so they are to call him Ish; and the name holds memories. It calls to mind the story of the first moment shared between the first man and woman in the world, the first husband and wife. In that moment, the man joyously named himself ish in relation to ishshah, because he saw that she was taken out of him, and of his same being2. The names were set up as a memorial to that original bond, for which reason men in all ages are said to leave their father and mother, and cleave to their wife in marriage so as to become one flesh3. This is what is established as the original relationship between man and woman/husband and wife, before the breaking of the first covenant with the taste of the forbidden fruit, before their experience of the world and of each other was changed, before the woman was doomed to be subject to the husband she desires4. So it would seem that, in causing Israel to no longer call him Baal, and instead to call him Ish, God is even urging the people to rediscover for themselves the original meaning of the relationship between Ish and Ishshah, the way the first man and woman knew each other before the breaking of covenant, and then to apply it to their relationship with God. And the people will express this found-again knowledge of their relationship with God by calling him Ishi, my husband, instead of Baali, my husband/lord.

The echoes of Genesis continue: God is next given to say that he will make a covenant for his people on that day with all the other living creatures, and that he will abolish violence from the land5. The language brings to mind the original state of the world as it was imagined by the author of Genesis 1, a state wherein there was no violence between any creatures with the breath of life, and all was very good 6. Then, his next words are stunning:

And I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know YHWH. (Hos 2:19-20)

In response to her awareness of him as her husband, which she acknowledges by calling him Ishi, God takes Israel as his wife; the covenant between the people and the other living creatures in the land is followed by a covenant of love between the people and their God. She has answered his wooing; and now he answers her appeal to him as Ishi. The language is that of the covenant; but here the covenant at Sinai is seen anew as a marriage vow, with both sides affirming their acceptance of the other's love, and taking on the duties—faithfulness, righteousness, steadfast love—owed to the other. And then, the marriage is to be consummated: You shall know YHWH (Hos 2:20).

Know here is a stunning word. For in the context of marriage, it takes on a particular meaning. To know someone in this sense is to enter into the most intimate relationship with them that two persons can. Elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, it describes the very act of conjugal union in which a man cleaves to his wife such that the two become one flesh. It is used thus for the first time in Genesis 4:1, when it is said: Now Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain […] So in this God is given to make a great affirmation of the dignity of his human partner Israel; you can and will know YHWH your God in the most personal and intimate way possible.

The assertion that Israel can and will enter into this relationship with God hangs wholly upon the use of the divine name here. It completes the affirmation of the people's knowledge of God; for they are to know him once again as YHWH, by his personal name, which he gave them when he brought them out of slavery in Egypt and into the wilderness to make covenant with them.

Just as with human lovers, this relationship of mutual knowledge bears fruit and blessings. Out of that intimate knowledge springs new life, and that new life is the children, just as in Gen 4:1. Here the three children of Israel—Jezreel, Lo-ruhamah, and Lo-ammi—are adopted by God through a renaming, as he undoes the names which he gave them before7:

On that day I will answer, says YHWH, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth; and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they shall answer Jezreel; and I will sow him for myself in the land. And I will have pity on Lo-ruhamah, and I will say to Lo-ammi, ""You are my people""; and he shall say, ""You are my God."" (Hos 2:21-23)

God's acceptance of the children of Israel, acknowledged through this renaming of them, is symbolic of a return to the blessed state in the land. The children will call, and God will answer through the land and the forces of nature which bring forth life. The name of Jezreel, not even changed, is reinterpreted. Before, it was given by God to be a memory of the site of Jehu's rebellion against the house of Ahab, king of Israel, a thing which, in the view of this text, is a cause for punishment by God8. Now the name, taken for its literal meaning, God sows, is to be a sign of the newly recovered fertility of the land, and a promise by God to once again establish them in the land as his chosen portion: I will sow him for myself in the land. Lo-ruhamah, the unpitied, unloved, becomes Ruhamah (pitied) once more; and Lo-ammi, not my people, becomes Ammi (my people) again, just as in Hosea 2:1. Through this renaming, the children whom God before called children of whoredom become the legitimate children of God and Israel, the fruit of their common love. So in this conception, the fruit of Israel's recovered knowledge of YHWH is a return to the blessed state in the land. The marriage metaphor is complete, as Israel's children are blessed in the knowledge of YHWH, and become his own; now that they truly know YHWH as YHWH, they can return to the land once more.

God's acceptance of the children is answered by their acceptance of him in the final vows to belong to one another: You are my people; you are my God. This call and answer is the sum of Hosea's interpretation of Exodus: the covenant at Sinai was so many words of love between Israel the bride and YHWH the groom, marriage vows exchanged in the wilderness. Hosea urges the people of Israel to remember that YHWH is their God, the God who set them free, who brought them out of slavery in Egypt and into the wilderness because he loved them. The ideal relationship between God and his people, then, is one not of servitude, but of mutual knowledge, as of a man and a woman in marriage; and the fruit of that knowledge is a return to the original blessed state in the land, and the original blessed state of Israel's relations with God.",70.6,34.19,26.1,22.06,12139
English,Report,Undergraduate,On the Names of God and Man,"The authors of Genesis 1 and 2, whoever they may be, share a deep interest in names and their origins. In fact, many of the stories in this book seem to have come about from a deep contemplation on certain names. This kind of creation from philology is reflected in the conceit of God's naming, beginning in Genesis 1. There, names are creative; they establish the nature of things.

The stories of Man's naming, however, which begin in Genesis 2, clearly present the opposite relationship, in which names follow the nature of things. Because this is so, we the readers can actually observe the workings of Man's mind in the process of naming. That is, we can see why the man gives the names that he does. This is precisely because for Man, naming is an expression of his concrete knowledge of the nature of a thing, especially as it relates to his own nature as a human being. So we can see the man's experience of the world in the names that he gives to express that experience.

Now what Man's experience of himself is at this point is a silent spot in the text. We the readers are told that the LORD God formed man (adam) from the dust of the ground (adamah) (Gen 2:7). But we are not told whether the man is aware of himself as adam, or when this self-awareness comes about. This raises a number of questions: what does the man know of himself at this point? What has God told him of himself, if anything? Does the man know what he is, and what it means to be Man? The text simply does not give us the answers right out. But what it does give us is a story of Man's naming of himself.

In this story, God first invites Man to take part in the process of naming all the other living beings: So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name (Gen 2:19). This invitation is the hinge between God's naming in Genesis 1 and Man's in Genesis 2, the two forming a sort of diptych, set against one another to show both how they are like, and how they are unlike.

Let us first return then to God's naming, so as to put Man's naming in its proper context. In Genesis 1, by giving a name to each thing, God makes it what it is, the way it is and no other. One can take, for example, God's creation of light: Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light (Gen 1:3). Here, the creation is in the giving of the name, light. The moment God puts a name to the idea of light, it becomes a reality; the moment he speaks the word light, light comes to be.

God's naming in Genesis 1 is distinctive as well as creative. God distinguishes between the natures of things by giving them different names, thus ordering the world. Immediately after bringing light to be with a word, God makes a distinction in nature between the new-made light and the already existing darkness: And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night […] (Gen 1:4-5). The statements are parallel, and seem to describe the same action. God separates the light from the darkness by calling the light Day, and the darkness Night; the act of giving different and distinct names is the very act of separating the two things. In this very first act of Genesis, God's effective naming—creating and ordering the world—sets the stage for Man's naming in Genesis 2 and beyond by establishing the bond between name and nature, as determined in the act of creation.

With this fresh in mind, one turns to the second creation story in Genesis 2, in which it is Man that does the naming. Here it is important to note that God will create the living beings, but Man will name them. Also, Man's participation in the naming process is directly related to his loneliness and lack of a partner; the issue bookends the episode in which Man names the animals:

Then the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner. So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. (Gen 2:18-20)

So it would seem that God invites the man to take part in the naming process precisely to let him find for himself the answer to his loneliness; the process of naming all the living beings will be, for the man, a search for something like himself, for a helper as his partner (Gen 2:19,20).

Here the man, like God in Genesis 1, distinguishes between the kinds of animals according to their distinct natures. But unlike the names God gives, Man's names do not determine their natures; rather, they are an expression of an awareness on Man's part of distinctions in nature—distinctions already established by God in the act of creation. God creates, Man classifies.

The names the man gives to the animals seem to be rather arbitrary: the text simply says, whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name (Gen 2:19). There is not presented in the text any particular reason for giving whatever names he does, any particular relation between the sound and the sense. But the truth that the man is recognizing is not revealed in the names taken individually; the truth about their natures as he knows them is revealed simply in the difference in the names in relation to one another. That is to say, the man expresses his recognition of their different natures by giving them different names.

Far the most important distinction the man makes in his naming of the animals is that between all other living beings and himself. This text seems to conceive that Man cannot identify himself except in the presence of another of his own kind. So the man, not yet in the presence of this other self, begins the process of self-identification by recognizing what is not like him: The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man (adam) there was not found a helper as his partner (Gen 2:20). This awareness of himself as different from the other creatures is expressed by a non-identification: Man does not yet name himself during this process. This is precisely because for the man there was not found a helper as his partner (Gen 2:20). At this point, the man has recognized distinctions between each kind of animal, expressed in the different names he gives them, and between all other animals and himself, expressed by his lack of a name. But he has not yet found something like him in the world; he has not yet recognized himself, his own humanity, in any other living being. And so Man has not yet named himself. This will only come upon the creation of the woman, the partner the man has been wanting.

The creation of the woman from the man immediately follows—both sequentially and logically—the man's classification of the animals, in which he failed to find a partner like him. It is in some ways the crowning act of God's creation in this story, in that it completes the creation of the human being, begun with the creation of the man in Genesis 2:7, and spanning the creation of all other living things. It is certainly the most important moment in the man's life, which has been incomplete without the woman: his loneliness, for which the woman is found to be the only answer, God himself declares to be not good (Gen 2:18). The creation of the woman will lead to the man's joyous affirmation of what is human, expressed in a twin naming:

This at last is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;
this one shall be called Woman (Ishshah),
for out of Man (Ish) this one was taken. (Gen 2:23)

In naming himself, now distinctly ish with the presence of ishshah, he first recognizes the essential likeness between the two of them: This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh […] (Gen 2:23). That is, he recognizes that they share the same being. Then he expresses this awareness in the names he gives. And here he makes a master stroke; for he makes a subtle distinction in naming which recognizes their difference while preserving their essential likeness, giving different yet related names. The names express the man's new self-awareness, and his knowledge of the relationship between male and female as established in God's creation of the woman from the man. They become memorials of this original bond between them: ishshah and ish, like yet unlike, dual yet complementary, together making up humanity, otherwise incomplete. Every time one hears ish and ishshah, one is reminded of the integrity of man and woman.

Man's naming here reaches a sublime level. The extraordinary care with which the man names the woman and himself in relation to one another reveals a man who has fully realized his linguistic potential: in fitting the sound of the two words to the true nature of the bond between them, the man comes as close as Man can to the language of God, that language of Genesis 1 in which the nature was established by the name. For the correspondence, the play between the sounds of the words, realizes the nature of the original bond between the man and the woman. Just as the man's life is incomplete without the woman, so the name ish has no meaning except in relation to ishshah. That is, the truth that these names memorialize is not to be found in either name taken alone; the truth is found in the aural likeness of the two.

Here is established the concept of Man's naming which echoes throughout Genesis and beyond: names follow the nature of things. At this point, Man's words, the names that he gives, are direct reflections upon the nature of the world as he experiences it, as he lives it every day. Thus the natural bond between their bodies, relived each time a man and woman have sex1, is reflected in the names ishshah and ish (Gen 2:24). Thus does Man's naming approach that of God, though without quite reaching it.

Man will continue to give names as he comes to know new realities. When the man learns about the process of childbirth in Genesis 3—apparently for the first time—he calls his wife Eve, living, because she was the mother of all living (Gen 3:20). When Eve first brings forth a son, when childbirth becomes a part of her reality, she names him Cain, seen as related to the word qanah, to beget, saying I have begotten a man with the help of the LORD (Gen 4:1). And so it goes, and a pattern is established. Behind every name, there is a story of origins; names themselves are compact stories, unfolded in the pages of Genesis. These names, then, become memorials. They are set up as Man comes to know himself and the world around him, which he is given to order. Naming itself is a reminder of Man's position in the world, and his relation to other living beings and to God. For naming is something that God and Man share; but Man's naming is dependent upon God's. God makes the world the way it is, what it is and no other, by naming; Man names this world to express his experience of it, and to remember.

English,Report,Undergraduate,Khrrrrklak: Stephen's Deconstruction of Himself through a Series of Alternative Identities,"As he walks along Sandymount Strand in the Proteus chapter of James Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Dedalus's immediate surroundings prompt him to meditate on the world around him. Yet for all his efforts to read the deeper metaphysical meanings latent in these surroundings, Stephen categorically resists mulling over the one aspect of his environment that would seem to matter to him the most: himself. This is not to say that Stephen never thinks of himself or what is going on in his life as he meanders along the Strand. On the contrary, no matter how far-ranging or obscure his thoughts become, Stephen's musings always channel themselves back into the anxieties he feels over the recent turn of events that have come to define his everyday life. Since he cannot mentally or emotionally deal with these anxieties, however, he spends much of Proteus channeling thoughts related to these anxieties back into the philosophical arguments and creative mental scenes so conducive to his artistic turn of mind.

Tellingly, the most effective strategy Stephen has for diverting away these anxious personal thoughts is identifying his situation with similar situations experienced by various literary and historical figures. This process of identification proves effective in helping Stephen circumvent his personal troubles because it calls strongly on his intellect; by forcing himself to invest his intellectual and imaginative faculties in the situations of other people, Stephen is able to temporarily escape the confines of his life and its attendant worries.

Stephen's reliance on this mental strategy becomes more and more pronounced as Proteus goes on, to the point where he stops merely identifying with literary and historical figures and starts literally imagining himself in their places. He then takes this progression away from himself one step further, inhabiting imaginary doppelganger selves that place him at an even greater remove from his anxieties without ever letting him entirely escape them. The result is a string of alternative identities for Stephen that generally occur in response to the three main nodes around which his personal problems center: his family, his artistic ambitions, and his Irish heritage. Ultimately, Joyce uses these identities to show Stephen in the process of learning how to deconstruct himself and his personal fears by imagining himself in positions other than his own—a psychological process that will be crucial to Stephen in his quest to define himself as an author.

Stephen first trades out his identity for an alternative identity in order to escape the anxiety he feels at being born into a lower class Irish family. Intriguingly, Stephen's desire to give up his identity as a member of the Dedalus family is rooted in a supposed identity theft committed by Stephen's father: [I was made by] the man with my voice and my eyes (Ulysses, 3.45-6). Contrary to the natural order of things, Stephen claims that his father has his voice and his eyes, not that he has the voice and eyes of his father. In thus inverting the natural progression of genetic traits from father to son, Stephen gives the impression that his father has somehow taken his voice and his eyes from him—in a sense, that he has unrightfully taken two crucial pieces of Stephen's identity. The result is a family dynamic inverted from the norm: whereas most people feel that they derive a good part of their identity from their fathers and other family members, Stephen feels that his family (and particularly his father) has taken a good part of its identity from him. The result is an identity theft that runs oddly athwart of nature.

Stephen tries to reclaim his identity from his family throughout Portrait and Ulysses by creating identities for himself that are separate from his identity as a member of the family. He even tries to do so as a child, telling the Clongowes gentry [that he] had an uncle a judge and a uncle a general in the army (3.101-102). By the time that the events in Proteus occur, however, Stephen has started to ponder how much of his identity he does in fact owe to his family. Characteristically, Stephen escapes the emotional strain of the issue by means of a mental problem in which he implicitly substitutes himself and his father into the theological problem of how God the Father relates to God the Son. Tellingly, he first performs this substitution only a few sentences after he refers to his father as taking his eyes and his voice: They [Stephen's parents] clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. . . . A lex eterna stays about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial? (3.47-50). Stephen then goes on to refer to Arius, the first century heresiarch who argued for the transubstantiality of the Father over the Son (Gifford, 3.50-52).

Taken together, these two remarks show Stephen mentally trading places with Christ in the Holy Trinity and invoking a theologian who said that God and Jesus are not of the same substance. Combined, they comprise a mental maneuver that allows Stephen an intellectually aloof way of conceptualizing his own identity as distinct from the identity of his father and, consequently, his family. More importantly, it takes the emotional sting out of what Stephen is really saying: namely, that he wants to be nothing like his father and wants to be as separate from his family as possible.

Stephen's anxiety over his family is not nearly as prominent throughout Proteus as his anxiety over his artistic ambitions, however. After reflecting on the decay of the house of his family as well as the decay of all Irish houses, Stephen ponders his desire to create beauty as an artist:

Come out of [these houses of decay], Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them to the woods of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to footpace. . . .  (Ulysses, 3.106-115)

Though it may not seem like it at first, Stephen's above vision of Jonathan Swift cuts across many of his fears pertaining to his vocation as an artist. The first is the poignant sense of isolation that Stephen's self-imposed exile from other people has brought him. Stephen arrogantly declares this exile towards the conclusion of Portrait when he says that . . .I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use—silence, exile, and cunning (Portrait, p. 268-9). By the time the events in Proteus take place, however, Stephen has had some time to feel the full effect of this exile, including the isolation that prompts him to declare that: I am lonely here. . . . I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch me, touch me (Ulysses, 3.433-5).

Stephen's imagining of himself as Swift (whom he describes as him me) fleeing from his congregants cuts to the quick of Stephen's professed loneliness. Important to note is that Swift is not only cut off from what he degradingly calls the hundredheaded rabble of his congregation but that his status as a hater of his kind has driven him to a solitary existence in the woods of madness. Crucial to Stephen's imagining of Swift here is that Swift's artistic fame rests on works such as Gulliver's Travels that are thought to be founded upon Swift's deep hatred for his fellow man (Gifford, 3.109-10). Consequently, Stephen's vision of himself as Swift beautifully illustrates his fears of what his self-imposed artistic exile may lead to: namely, that the isolation he already feels may turn into insanity, and that such insanity may be the price he has to pay if he is to ever achieve literary immortality on a par with Swift.

Stephen's temporary identity switch with Swift also has interesting artistic ramifications in light of Stephen's refusal to join the priesthood in section IV of Portrait. Unlike Stephen, Swift opted for artistry and the priesthood, a double-vocation the inherent tension of which Stephen calls to mind when imagining Dryden speaking to him/Swift: Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully holy, weren't you? (Ulysses, 3.128). Stephen's imagined phrase comes from a similar comment Dryden once made to Swift: Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet (Gifford, 3.128). The alterations Stephen makes are telling: in trading saint for poet, he once again renounces his potential identity as a priest, but he also brings in the question of vocation as it pertains to poetry and the arts. In effect, Stephen seems to be implicitly wondering whether his self-determined vocation as an artist is his true calling or whether he is simply faking a sense of destiny. Stephen may never be a saint, but the tacit question of whether or not he will be an artist worries him enough to launch him into an excoriation of his own literary ambitions the instant his vision of himself as Swift dissipates (Ulysses, 136-146).

A final alternative identity of Stephen's that gets at the core of his artistic anxiety occurs not between Stephen and a literary or historical figure but between Stephen and an imaginary doppelganger. Stephen conjures up this doppelganger in one of his more disturbing recollections of his time in Paris:

Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris, boul' Mich', I used to. Yes, [I] used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested [me] for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Lui, c'est moi. You seem to have enjoyed yourself. (3.178-183)

Stephens ostentatious reference to the boul' Mich', or the Boulevard Saint-Michel, once again brings to mind his artistic ambitions (the boul' Mich' was a renowned hangout for aspiring young artists), but the context in which he makes that reference seems to suggest some sort of psychological link in his mind between art and murder. Curiously enough, Stephen never explains why he feels the need for an alibi for murder while in Paris. But even more curious is that when Stephen imagines himself being arrested, he does not claim that he is innocent, but that the perpetrator of the murder was some other version of himself that cannot be justified by the paper tickets Stephen proper carries around. What's more, whether or not Stephen knows it, the murder Joyce is referring to was an actual murder committed in Dublin off Stephen Street and charged by a judge named Mr. Swift, recalling not only Stephen's vision of himself as Jonathan Swift but all the artistic anxieties associated with it. Whatever Joyce's specific intention is in blending all of these elements together, the overall impression is that Stephen's decision to leave his family and pursue his artistic ambitions in Paris is so fraught with guilt and anxiety that he associates his decision with murder, whether or not he is consciously aware of it. Try as he might to pawn the blame for this art murder off on a doppelganger, however, Stephen seems unable to fully foist his guilt onto one of his imagined identities—that is, onto some other me.

The final node of real-life anxiety that Stephen tries to avoid by trading places with certain imagined identities is his uneasiness over his Irish heritage. Once again, a good jumping-off point can be found in Stephen's imagining of Dryden telling him/Swift that he will never be a saint, prompting Stephen to recall that one of Ireland's epithets is the isle of saints (3.128). In addition to shutting Stephen out from the priesthood, Dryden's imaginary comment, by a process of simple substitution, seems to be Stephen's way of telling himself that he will never be Irish. The substitution is especially fitting because, like the priesthood, Stephen also renounces Ireland when he is still very young; now a little bit older, Stephen has had more of a chance to think over what that renunciation truly means.

Stephen's grappling with this renunciation occurs more strongly in relation to his acquaintanceship with the Irish expat Kevin Egan. Like Stephen, Egan has forced himself into exile in Paris, but unlike Stephen, Egan spends most of his time remembering thee, O Sion—that is, drinking heavily and wallowing in Irish nostalgia. Characteristically, Stephen finds Egan's nostalgia nauseating (though he willing sits through it), as evident in his summation of Egan's stories about the Fenians:

How the head centre [James Stephens] got away, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahid. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here. (3.241-44)

Stephen's description of lost leaders and the betrayed is typical of his view of Irish politics and their constant dynamics of betrayal and failed leaders—dynamics consistent enough for Stephen's words to apply just as aptly to Parnell as they do to Stephens. Yet what's really interesting in Stephen's disdainful comment about would-be Irish revolutionaries such as Egan and Stephens is Stephen's contempt for their clutched at, missing disguises. Ostensibly, Stephen is referring to the story that Stephens disguised himself as a woman to escape Ireland (Gifford, 3.241). Yet, though he may not be aware of it, Stephen could just as easily be talking about himself: like the countrymen he has renounced, Stephen too is clutching at disguises in the form of the many identities he mentally inhabits in order to get away from his worries, including those worries related to his heritage as an Irishman.

Stephen's inadvertent description of himself as yet another Irishman clutching at a disguise takes on an even more pointed meaning when he criticizes himself for hoping to gain his countrymen's praise by means of his art: For what are you pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. . . . All king's sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now (Ulysses 3.312-17). Crucial to understanding the full impact of this passage is the passage that directly precedes it, in which Stephen imagines himself as a ghost watching his ancestors hack apart a beached whale: Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me (3.6-9). Stephen is again invoking his doppelganger, his other me, only this time his other self is watching violence instead of actively participating in it. The image of Stephen's doppelganger as an isolated specter watching the brutality of his fellow Irish citizens can serve as an apt metaphor for Stephen's detached observation of Irish politics. Yet Stephen also says that the barbaric lust of his ancestors' blood is in him: removed as he may be from their violent activities, he still partakes of their violence by means of being their offspring.

Consequently, though Stephen may view Ireland as a paradise of pretenders, he himself cannot claim to be separate from the chronic pretending that he sees as permeating Irish politics and culture. Unlike most of his fellow Irish, however, Stephen's pretending is an artistic pretending—though he himself is constantly between artistic disguises and traded identities, these other Stephens are at least of his own creation and, on the surface at least, free from the anxieties of family, artistry, and heritage that cause Stephen's true self so much suffering.

By the end of Proteus, Stephen has managed to temporarily trade his way through several identities and selves, undergoing a series of Protean metamorphoses in response to pressure of being pinned down by his everyday worries and fears. The result is a semi-controlled atomization of Stephen's sense of self, the effect of which recalls Stephen's violent fantasy killing of a Paris poster worker: shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack black (3.187-88). Like the shot-gunned postal worker, Stephen's sense of self is blasted to bits throughout Proteus as his anxieties prompt him to search for other selves to temporarily inhabit. The question, however, is whether Stephen will ever clack back into the fully formed artistic self he desperately longs to be. True to form, Joyce never does show Stephen fully put back together again, even after the novel reaches its finish. But by showing him beginning to grasp the psychological process of taking on other identities—a process crucial to the kind of character creating abilities necessary to become a competent artist—Joyce hints that Stephen will one day be the kind of author who can write a book as complex and filled with other selves as Ulysses.",0,0,20.26,6.23,17025
English,Report,Undergraduate,PERSPECTIVE: The differing revolutions of Stone and Kishlansky,"In both Lawrence Stone's Causes of the English Revolution and Mark Kishlansky's A Monarchy Transformed, the authors submit what they have interpreted to be the causes of the English Revolution under Charles I. The way in which they present history, however, differs slightly in their regard for individual figures and their chronological scope and consideration.

Stone adopts a predominantly macro perspective on the happenings of the mid-seventeenth century in that he does not actually limit his investigation to that era but instead spends the majority of his essay considering the events of the sixteenth. Discussion of the Revolution itself is limited to a few spare pages at the end, and the bulk of his book is as he intends it to be:limited to defining the long-term factors which made some modifications of the political and religious institutions very probable (Stone 146). For instance, despite his apparent antipathy towards the monarchs (No sensible man could take [James's] claims too seriously (94), royal policies…were opportunistic, grasping, selfish, and rude (127), Impetuous folly (133) and bottomless duplicity of King Charles (138), etc.), Stone largely remains unfocused on the actions of any individual figures. Though he theorizes that a personally more charismatic king…might have continued [ruling]…without running into serious trouble (133), he also claims that Charles I's decisions were no more than one step in a long anterior chain…traced far back into the early Tudor period (146).

It seems, then, that Stone is set upon both determinist and sociological views of history; an apparent sacrifice of free will in favor of laying any praise or blame on decades of complicated interactions between large groups in a society. Charles's belief and attempted reinforcement of his Divine Right was not unexpected – monarchs long before him assumed the same. In fact, what the author names as Tudor despotism had its origins long before Henry VII and was enforced in other European countries at the time. However, Henry VIII's break with Rome began a spiral of increasing dependence upon the kindness and power of Parliament to fund and support the Crown, which in turn empowered the Houses to make more demands as the century moved onward. Seen from this perspective, the explosion of the Revolution after Parliament finally stared down Charles I seems quite a logical conclusion. Again, Stone posits this outcome as a result of an incompetent royalty – The proven untrustworthiness of the King inevitably forced Pym and his allies to increase their demands, out of sheer necessity of self-preservation. They now genuinely feared for their lives…they were therefore obliged…to demand control over the armed forces (138)1. To Stone, Charles I's continued, narcissistic abuse of his royal prerogative ultimately led the country into dangerous ground and forced Parliament's hand. But he makes it clear that the social, economic, and political relations in England were well-troubled long before Charles I mounted the throne.

Kishlansky, on the other hand, espouses the more micro, historicist standpoint. Though he takes care to write roughly the first half of his book providing the appropriate historical background of Charles's reign, he also focuses his lens much more fixedly on the drama of individual figures and then follows the climax with a long dénouement detailing the ultimate failure of anti-monarchical rule. Each chapter begins with an italicized and stylized recounting of the personal experiences of characters such as Guy Fawkes or the King and then progresses into a vivid account of the happenings of the Revolution. He develops identities for James I (He was athletic and loved to ride…doted on his Danish wife…crass, not callous (Kishlansky 69)), Charles I (Fastidious in his personal life and methodical in his government…an aesthete (118)), and John Pym (A man of mean estate and modest station…[with] social self-effacement (142)). Unlike Stone, Kishlansky seems more sympathetic towards the monarchs, depicting them as relatable people who made some unfortunate decisions and were preyed upon. In fact, the author's theatricality when relating the lives of seventeenth-century England extends almost into the arena of a historical novel with passages like that of Charles's execution and the monarch's conversation with his ten-year-old son, Henry.

The effect of these passages is humanizing and specific; each player in his history is responding to the events in the present and thus elicits more definite consequences. James's loose rein on England created division within his Council and his increasing debt exacerbated his relationship with Parliament. Likewise, Charles gradually loses his grasp of his Divine Right because of fiscal debt accrued and Parliament takes advantage of the King's situation. Thus, Kishlansky's language implies a Parliament and Pym more insidious and opportunist than Stone's self-defending Houses of the people. He writes, The mistrust that members of Parliament felt towards their king, their paranoia about plots and their delusions about Charles's intentions were crucial components in the origins of the Civil War (145)2. In Kishlansky's writing, Charles seems less a self-interested despot and more a misstepping and misguided but ultimately forgiveable monarch who attempted to use the traditional Divine Right in self-defense from an increasingly antagonistic governing elite. It is only after a year of concession and humiliation [that] Charles I…finally decided to seize the initiative from the House of Commons (134). According to Kishlansky, it was Charles I's hand that was forced.

So where lay the blame? Attribution is ultimately impossible. However, we may question the effectiveness of these authors' arguments. On one hand, a macro view like Stone's offers a wide range of lessons: because of its broader scope, its outcomes and influences can be applied to the fates of other societies and epochs, which would in turn act to prevent the repetition of the Revolutionary state as such; it serves to shift the culpability to a larger mentality/group of people rather than focusing on the foolishness of just one person; and it promotes and appreciation of the intricacy and interconnectedness of human interaction and consequence in a manner quite sociological. However, this point of view also remains somewhat ignorant of the idea of free will, seems to promote more uncertainty and backward-looking than Kishlansky's standpoint, and comes across as very dry and impersonal in writing.

In contrast, Kishlansky's micro humanist perspective is more engaging and makes it easier for the contemporary reader to sympathize with select historical figures long dead. It makes history more emotionally real, more compelling, and more understandable. One may argue that the humanization of these mummified personas helps to fascinate and encourage the literary imagination and enrich the body of discourse about events like the English Revolution and its main players. Personal relation evokes a stronger response in the realm of art because each work is interpreted individually by each reader, viewer, or listener according to his or her own mentality. But then the argument could also be turned to say that the flux of art interacts more intimately with the flow and ebb of larger societal concerns: it is the social context which adds meaning to much canonical literary pieces and artwork, and it is consideration for social context which makes them effective today. In the end, I think both points of view are instrumental in recreating history for a younger generation – for invoking emotion and tempering it with understanding about societal causation.

English,Report,Undergraduate,"Defining Wild Nature: A brief study of H. D. Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Robert Frost, and Mary Oliver","Defining wildness – even tracing another’s definition – can be a daunting project. In the words of Gary Snyder, The word wild is like a gray fox trotting off through the forest, ducking behind bushes, going in and out of sight (9). Following wild through literature and popular consciousness could be a lifelong project; even within the last few centuries, the word has wandered through such varied connotations as terror, the unknown, desperate and bleak desolation, darkness, immortality and life, mortality and death, and almost everywhere in-between. Within the margins of this paper, I wish to examine specific writers who, in one way or another, have set out through their writings to discuss – at times, to praise – wildness. From them, I do not necessarily seek formal definitions (though those do willingly appear at times), but statements that reveal an opinion or an underlying belief – self-consciously or not – of what, to the author, wild is, what it evokes, inspires, means. Through deliberate tracts on wildness (such as Henry David Thoreau’s Walking, Gary Snyder’s Practice of the Wild, or The Wilderness Act of 1964) and selected poetry – here, a very small sampling from Mary Oliver and Robert Frost – we can begin to piece together the sense of what wild means to us, the contemporary Americans who are, knowingly or not, born from Transcendentalists, still looking to Thoreau for an understanding of who we are, how we live.

In many ways, Thoreau’s Walking is a project of language reclamation, of massaging a reader into positive – or, perhaps, a reverent – readings of words that had previously incited terror and anxiety. To describe his sense of wild nature1, Thoreau only had access to words that had been used as scare tactics for centuries, certainly including wild and wilderness, but from those words he coaxes inspiration, rather than terror. His reader is even convinced to respect the  awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet, even placed in the context of the cries emitted by wild beasts in their native forests (234), an image that might not be expected to strike the typical 19th century American reader softly. In the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of ferity, an example from a late 17th century sermon reads, Is it not brutish Ferity rather than manly boldness? (OED), placing the word as an undeniably pejorative term up against manly boldness. Ferity is, as Gary Snyder notes, of the same Latin root as feral and fierce, and – beyond what Snyder includes – ferocious. But for Thoreau, ferity takes on a bold tone, encouraging the reader to participate in a migratory instinct to join wildness (if one wants to join the good men and lovers that have this awful ferity), rather than giving them any motivation to flee. Throughout Walking, he manages to craft his rhetoric in a way that pushes the otherwise terrifying descriptors of wildness into new, adulatory tropes, reforming what wild can mean, and fostering human desire for nature.

Snyder takes up much of the same project of redefinition, though much more explicitly. He methodically recasts definitions from the O.E.D. in positive terms – aiming to define wild by what it is  and not by what it is not. Snyder is aware that how we define the terms of our life dictates much more than our dictionaries; our words can be crucial in shaping and crafting our mindsets and interactions, not just in reflecting them. This intent focus on language takes on the form of a deliberate craft for both Snyder and Thoreau. Snyder muses on the nature of language, which is like an infinitely inter-fertile family of species, that reflects (and informs)2 the shifting values of the peoples whose minds it inhabits and glides through (8) before he goes on to his several pages that focus solely on careful definitions, histories, and etymologies. Careful can even be applied to Thoreau’s attention to language, which may be a surprising adjective to a modern critical reader of Thoreau’s writings. From the first page of Walking, he hones in on the etymology of saunterer in order to develop his point (205), and continues to subject language to scrutiny and close analysis.

Thoreau and Snyder, however, both assert that the wild is beyond definition, beyond language, and more generally beyond any cerebral knowledge humans can muster. Particularly for Thoreau, wild nature is necessarily unknowable and always beyond our grasps. Wildness, in this sense, is much more akin to Kantian sublimity than to the desolate wilderness described by 17th century Plymouth governor William Bradford (Knott). In Walden, Thoreau writes,

we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. … We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander (Walden, 366).

To be wild is to be infinite, staggeringly abundant, and thus unknowable or unreachable. The truly wild is beyond our human grasps, and being faced with that incomprehensibility is what provokes the overwhelming feeling of awe and presence in wild nature. Snyder also picks up on this, categorizing the way of Great Nature, or Dao in Chinese, as a similarly sublime concept, eluding analysis [and existing] beyond categories (11). When Snyder seeks to explain that our own minds are wild, he draws on our inability for cognitive awareness as proof, writing that [t]here are more things in mind, in the imagination, than 'you' can keep track of – thoughts, memories, images, angers, delights, rise unbidden. The depths of mind, the unconscious, are our inner wilderness3 areas… (17). Snyder’s point that our minds act independently from our intellect further emphasizes Thoreau’s dictum – and definition of what wild means – that we require endless distances between ourselves and an understanding of the wild.

This unknown element of the wild is, of course, exactly what was seen for centuries as the terror inherent in wildness. The paradigm of fearing the unknown is certainly not yet extinct, nor is it likely to mature any more wisely in our human futures. As for the unknown in nature, Robert Frost’s Desert Places provides a good example of the use of a desolate wilderness, the kind of wilderness defined as a wasteland, in Snyder’s terms (11), as an evocation of anxiety. The poem takes place in a field that is filling with snow, and the speaker explains his loneliness as parallel to – or, ambiguously, caused by – the falling snow. He anticipates the loneliness will only increase as his perception (and, thus, understanding) of the field fades, as [a] blanker whiteness of benighted snow falls, a ground-covering [w]ith no expression, nothing to express. The sense that the field refuses to speak with him, to explain or express itself, contributes to the anxiety of the poem. This anxiety culminates in the last stanza:

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
Between stars, on stars where no human race is.
I have it in my so much nearer home
To scare myself with my own desert places.

Despite the speaker asserting that the field’s empty spaces do not scare him, his tone belies this claim. The paranoid and ambiguous appearance of a malevolent third party (the They), along with the conclusion at the end that it is, in fact, desert places that scare the speaker, show that desolation and the unknown have ultimate power over the human speaker, and the only option he has is to pull within himself.

The angst surrounding nature’s and seeming independence, when the speaker ambiguously claims that The woods around it have it – it is theirs (a moment where the reader is forced to question not only how the woods can have possession, but what the it is that they have possession of) returns us to Snyder’s description of our wild minds. One part of the quotation about human minds deserves a closer look: that the wildness does not just lie in the element of the unknowable, but also in the fact that the hidden thoughts and feelings rise unbidden (17). Snyder, on this topic, also says that the body is to a great extent self-regulating, … a life of its own (Ibid.). This gets at the core of both Thoreau’s and Snyder’s sense of what the word wild is, and where it comes from. According to Jack Turner, in one of Thoreau’s notebooks is a note that reads,  Wild – past participle of to will, self-willed (Turner, 82). The etymology – the very source and core – of wild, for Thoreau, is self-willed: that is, independent and internally-driven. Snyder agrees, saying that wild (or, willed) plants are self-propagating [and] self-maintaining, that wild (or, willed) animals are free agents, and that wild (or, willed) individuals are [u]nintimidated, self-reliant, independent (10-11). Snyder even locates this concept somewhere external to the English language and to any of Thoreau’s unverifiable etymologies, and finds that the Chinese zi-ran, self-thus, is used as an equivalent to wild (5). Dao also contains these ideas; he lists freely manifesting, self-authenticating, [and] self-willed as three explanations of Dao (11). The wild is very much its own, in this framework, rather than some poor, neglected fragment left over by man.

To these men, the self-willed wild is messy and brutal, but in a way that evokes our very liveliness. This wild emphasizes our mortality and our place, our belonging, in the life of the whole (Snyder, 12). Snyder begins his revision of the concept of the wild with an image of the ruthlessness of nature: In the wild, a baby Black-tailed Hare gets maybe one free chance to run across a meadow without looking up. There won’t be a second (4). Snyder is invigorated by the carnal, hungry wildness of nature. One of his declared definitions of wilderness is a place of danger and difficulty: where you take your own chances… and do not count on rescue (11). Rather than being repelled by this notion, Snyder considers it to be a transcendental experience of awareness, describing it in spiritual terms: To acknowledge that each of us at the table will eventually be part of the meal is not just being 'realistic.' It is allowing the sacred to enter and accepting the sacramental aspect of our shaky temporary personal being (20). This sense of what it means to partake in the realm of the wild (as we all do, whether we acknowledge it or not) is morbid, dark, painful, deeply spiritual and exhilarating.

As for Thoreau, loving the Wild means being cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and [sic] deriving health and strength from the repast (Walden, 366), and it means loving the gritty savagery of wild nature. The sight of an animal feasting on bone marrow open on a trail reminds us of the vast abundance, the strong appetite and inviolable health of Nature, showing us that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed (Ibid.). But Thoreau falls short of Snyder’s exuberance in that Thoreau’s sense of the brutal life cycle never quite reaches humans; Thoreau, our early representative of man-in-nature, is largely a witness, despite his claim that we are all a part and parcel of Nature (205). Humans are seemingly exempt from the hunger of wild nature, at least in the wilderness that he knows and writes of. He celebrates the American wild, because the traveler can lie down in the woods at night almost anywhere in North America without fear of wild beasts (Walking, 222). Thoreau’s wilderness is messy – but only for the animals. Because man has no need to fear for his own life, Nature is peculiarly fitted for [his] habitation (Ibid.).

Mary Oliver inhabits similar contradictions in her poems; she is often guilty of aestheticizing or aggrandizing wild brutality for the sake of poetics, but at times she locks right into the darkness of wild nature, of the sense of the tenuous grasp we have on life. In The Kingfisher, she displays both sides of this dichotomy, writing, I think this is / the prettiest world—so long as you don’t mind / a little dying. Her sense of death in nature here is quite healthy, acknowledging that death is but a part of wild life, and is no less beautiful for that. The poem provides a subtle distinction between the thoughtful and analytical human sense of the kingfisher’s hunt, and the kingfisher himself, who wasn’t born to think of the number of fish in the lake, or anything else. It is the human speaker’s job to rationalize the abundance inherent in the wild, as Thoreau and Snyder both do. As for the kingfisher, he is not meant to care: as a wild animal, hunger is the only story / he has ever heard in his life that he could believe.

In 1964, between Thoreau’s time and Snyder’s, The Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. The Wilderness Act presented a legal definition of wilderness, as written by the Wilderness Society. The law explains wilderness in contrast with those areas where men and his own works dominate the landscape (Wilderness Act, 2c). Snyder takes a page from the Act, and his definitions of wilderness can be seen not only as an etymological alternative to traditional definitions, but also as a concurrence with the standards of wilderness set forth by this newer legal definition. The act defines wilderness areas as lands retaining [their] primeval character and influence, which have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man’s work substantially unnoticeable (Ibid.). Snyder, somewhat eliding his definitions of wild and wilderness, comes close to repeating these sentiments regarding what wild lands are. He defines wildness in terms of land as a place where the original and potential vegetation and fauna are intact and in full interaction ad the landforms are entirely the result of nonhuman forces (10). To Snyder, Wilderness is a place where the wild potential is fully expressed (12), and can be defined briefly enough as A large area of wild land (11).

The Wilderness Act says that a wilderness area may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value. This seems like an exhaustive list, but there is at least one notable absence: agricultural value. The word wilderness is rarely – if ever – used to describe a so-called useful plot of land. As Snyder points out, 'good' land becomes private property (86). It is partitioned, purchased, and tended (methodically and according to a farmer’s plan, not nature’s self-determined order). One of Snyder’s few definitions that he specifically casts in the negative (defining wilderness for what it is not): an area unused or useless for agriculture or pasture (11).4 Similarly, Thoreau’s conceptualization of the rightful Westward journey is that people and cultures exhaust their current landscape, and then move Westward to a new world, where lands are still wild – that is, not used, not yet exhausted. In this sense, Thoreau and Snyder are on the same page with each other and the law of the United States, as they all agree to define wilderness as leftovers – or, alternately, as the land that we have not yet gotten to.

A point of contention between The Wilderness Act, Snyder, and Thoreau, appears at the question of inhabitants. The Wilderness Act simply states that, in wilderness, man himself is a visitor who does not remain (Wilderness Act, 2c). But Thoreau and Snyder, in the freedom of the literary genre of essay, as opposed to that of a legal document, both wander within the topic in more ambiguous ways. Thoreau inhabits contradictory notions of man’s relationship to nature. From the outset, and multiple times throughout Walking, he draws a strict dichotomy between society and wild nature, clearly favoring the latter. His ideal of Nature is wholly uninhabited, and the reason we are, by instinct, drawn West is that the ideal is the western horizon [which] stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, [where] there are no cities in it (217). The irony here is that the migratory instinct (219) to go into the uninhabited wild asks that men enter nature, to become part and parcel of the wild, rather than society (205). The bulk of Walking includes encouragement to humans to become closer inhabitants of nature; he himself boasts his two years as an inhabitant of wild nature as one of his points of pride. In this, Thoreau’s project is a largely contradictory one, one that never quite settles on an answer.

Snyder, on the other hand, negotiates the question of inhabitants with further subtlety and greater understanding of what human occupancy means – and has meant over the centuries. His modified definition of wild (of Land) conspicuously cuts the O.E.D.’s use of uninhabited. He acknowledges the vast native populations that lived on this land, saying that wild does not mean untouched by humans. Before the mass influx of Europeans, virtually all was wild in North America, and not only that, but [t]here were human beings, too: North America was all populated  (6). Snyder’s sense of the word wild, when it comes to inhabitants, also varies from Thoreau’s in that he has a more fluid sense of what a true inhabitant can be. He writes that only since the influx of major blocks of citified mythology (Medieval Christianity and then the ‘Rise of Science’) has the natural world been denied… soul, then consciousness, and finally even sentience (13). Because Snyder’s wilderness has only artificially been disembodied, it remains alive, sentient, present – inhabited. In this sense, it is human society that is less inhabited than the wild. In a twist on a reader’s expectations, he writes that [c]ivilization is permeable, and could be as inhabited as the wild is, if only it was more accommodating (16).

The concepts that evade clear definitions are also those that provoke the most contradictions. Wild is certainly one of those concepts. Wildness exceeds language, it is a sublime category that exhilarates in its incomprehensibility, in its refusal to be encompassed by any one word or phrase. It insists, always, to stay between two concepts or terms. Wildernesses are complex; nature is filled with complicated systems. This complexity is seen as good; wild nature is rich, full, blossoming, and endowed with incredible fecundity (Snyder, 12). Contradictions make literature and nature alike more rife, more alive. Walt Whitman famously writes in Song of Myself the apostrophic question and answer, Do I contradict myself? / Very well then . . . . I contradict myself; / I am large . . . . I contain multitudes (53). But these connotations are relatively recent – and certainly still growing – in the literary and intellectual realm. Thoreau and Snyder, along with others who usher in these new complexities, are both products and bearers of their moving times, and carry with them the language that makes our realities. Continuing to search for definitions of wildness may be an overwhelming task, but it is one that only becomes more and more fruitful. The further we follow wild, it seems, the deeper we can find ourselves in a mess.",0,0,0,0,19173
English,Report,Undergraduate,Rosamond Vincy and the Real Sphere,"An unmistakable delight shone from [her] eyes….Ideal happiness, (of the kind known in the Arabian Nigihts, in which you are invited to step form the labour and discourd of the street into a paradise where everything is given to you and nothing is claimed) seemed to be an affair of a few weeks waiting. (294)

In the societal realm in which Middlemarch resides, the demarcation between women and men are starkly defined. Notions of male and female character are, especially to a modern perspective, skewed—and it is clear from a modern reading that the effects of this social conditioning cause detriment in the individual characters and their relationships to others in the novel. Perhaps the most resonant of the ill-effects of social conditioning is the character Rosamond, a woman who is guided by the principles of supposed womanhood that have been, since childhood, ingrained into her psyche. She was painstakingly taught, by means of formal instruction, the supposed qualities of womanhood, and because of this, the reader is shown, she exists as Eliot’s hyper-socialized female character. She wishes to be treated as a delicate being incapable of invoking harm—she manipulates and obtains her desires by emphasizing the female stereotype—forgoing passion and at times veritable emotion for the obtaining of worldly prospects. These prospects are greatly concerned with social mobility and she is, like many characters in Eliot’s novel blinded by these desires, a fact that brings about her inability to separate the reality of her circumstance, from her conceptions of ideal scenario that are, much like that from Arabian Nights, characterized by the absence of responsibility (mental and physical, it seems), and the presence of prestige Her rather grandiose ideas of life as it should be, and her ignoring of life as it is, results in Rosamond’s strained relationship with Lydgate—spurred by her devotion to being completely absolved from fault, and her blind attachment to the superficial notions of high-society that her lineage and marriage don’t give her the capacity to obtain. It seems Eliot designed Rosamond’s conflict of the real and ideal, while contrasting it with that of Dorothea’s whose conflict is only further indication of her admirable humanity, to show and emphasize the effects of women operating under an imposing sphere that purports loss-of-self as the only road to success.

It could be said that Rosamond’s affinity to Lydgate was borne by the fact that his actual past was much of a mystery. This allowed Rosamond to impose her ideas of the ideal mate onto him, and as the ideas she imposed were essentially stunning, in a sense she became the instigator of her own courtship, converting flirtation to love, when the reader knows otherwise. The narrator states, Rosamond thought that no one could be more in love than she was, (Elliot, 295) and the insertion of thought into the equation emphasizes her illusion of genuine feeling. This is one of example of the instances throughout the novel Elliot gives subtle clues to the fact that Rosamond’s emotions and truths are not real: she more than once imagines knowledge, and rather than being right, the narrator maintains she is convinced that she is. The disparity between Rosamond’s fixation on her marriage to Lydgate, and the fact that he is initially apathetic to it, brings about a conflict that is telling to Eliot’s sentiment in terms of Rosamond, and women in a broad sense. First, it is clue into the genuine motive of Rosamond, that being to devise a life for herself rather than relying on providence. Lydgate was a mere character in the story she wishes to create, a fantasy in which she exists as an ephemeral entity to be sought after, ultimately achieved and lifted to great, eminent heights. She is, one might say, acting as a woman of the time should—with a sense of helplessness, and a faith that her male savior will present himself.

What the reader sees, however, is that Lydgate is too operating in his sphere of manhood, as he is far from invested in Rosamond, but rather enchanted by her beauty and girlish affectations. He regards Rosamond imposing of the ideal onto him as a mere tendency of the female mind: [Lydgate] held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. (Elliot, 234) This inclination of Lydgate suggests that his ideas of the feminine mind, are associated with naïve delusion and weakness, characteristics that Lydgate is drawn to, although more for his own desire to assuage than for an affinity to the afflicted. In this initial interplay between Lydgate and Rosamond, Rosamond’s conflicted real and ideal tangles their ideas of one another, based on the roles they play as male and female. On one end, Rosamond’s placing of pre-eminence on Lydgate reinforces notions of male-capacity (not to mention her deeming of him as refined based on surface-level qualities, such as his knowledge of the French language) and as Lydgate is flattered by her assumption, he reinforces her role as one whose mental capacity is lacking and whose mind is dull, but pretty still. To him, she is weak—a fact that he relishes. The reader sees this interplay again, more intensely, during the scene of Rosamond and Lydgate’s engagement, of sorts. And thus, Rosamond’s conflict between the real and ideal engendered the outcome she so desired—but the foreshadowing of future dismay is all too apparent.

Describing the character of Rosamond, the narrator states, on page 289, Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its way in spite of opposing rock. Rosamond, perhaps the epitome of female delicacy, so strongly adheres to her ideal world, that she is exasperatingly ardent her manipulation. This idea is manifested most blatantly in her marriage that is strained by Lydgate’s desire to have a wife that is secondary to his career, and Rosamond’s desire to have a husband that unrelentingly places her first. She defies his will even when he has her best interest in mind—forgoing his advice to refrain from horseback riding for the sake of posturing with Captain Lydgate.

At the onset of their financial woes, Rosamond acts as if Lydgate wishes to spite her, placing the blame on him, when in actuality all he had done was fail to live up to her grandiose expectations. She mistakes his exasperation with her and their marriage as mere moodiness, and dismisses his ill-dispositions to ensure that she is not affected by them. The narrator states, the thought in her mind was that if she had known Lydgate, she would have never married him (Elliot, 471), and what the reader sees, that Rosamond does not, is that Lydgate feels much of the same. Rosamond is unaware of this because she regards herself as the ideal, the embodiment of the perfect female specimen, the woman who no woman could behave more irreproachably than (472), completely free from culpability, a victim of her husband who had a way of taking things which made them a great deal worse for her. The reality of it, however, is that she is childish and artificial, a woman of polite impassibility (609), perhaps the only character who remains throughout Middlemarch, as morally stupid and one-dimensional as she began.

Through the fashioning of Rosamond’s character, it seems Elliot adhered to a strict notion of femininity—one that was perhaps the pervasive notion at the time. The strain in Rosamond’s marriage reaches a head, at the point when Lydgate is prone to outbursts of indignation, and his enchantment with his coy mistress has changed to subtle resentment. He realizes, he didn’t marry a virtuous woman, but rather his own idealized view of what this woman was based on socially accepted (surface level) ideas. Moreover, he realizes that although he has spent month after month sacrafising without impatience (464) Rosamond’s thirst for wealth and eminence and all the things she thinks will give merit to her womanhood is impossible to quench. It is the way with all woman, he says. However, [his] power of generalizing all women…was thwarted by [his] memory of wondering impressions from the behavior of another woman. (468) That woman, of course, being Dorothea.

There are two salient interplays between Dorothea and Rosamond in relation to the conflict between the real and ideal. The first being the nature of the two characters’ own conflicts. Rosamond’s conflict is purely of worldly affairs—she wishes to become something that represents something else. She negates her inner vitality and becomes a mechanical being, whose desires are to be adorned and to be scorned through jealously. Dorothea’s conflict, conversely is her unrelenting attachment to the good of others. One of the final scene of Middlemarch, in which she meets Rosamond, she assumes, wrongly, that Rosamoned’s actions are pure. Dorothea’s conflict is spurred by the fact that she herself is a pure human being—Rosamond’s is spurred by her diluted consciousness.

The second interplay moves away from the novel and into its context. Could Elliot have, in her two main female character presented her ideas of the real and ideal? It is perhaps a cynical view from the author (whose attitudes towards woman were rather cynical) because it seems Dorothea represents the ideal, while Rosamond in all of her outward grace but inner spoil, represents the real. And as Dorothea’s aspirations are never realized, the real story of women Elliot may be suggesting, is that of Rosamond, who stayed in her place and had her dreams (of marrying rich) ultimately fulfilled.",0,0,0,0,9716
English,Report,Undergraduate,Analysis of T.C. Boyle's A Friend of the Earth,"A Friend of the Earth, T.C. Boyle’s satirical novel, humorously critiques peoples’ attitudes toward the environment. These fictional attitudes, however, are not much different from the attitudes of people today. Boyle critiques peoples’ attitudes by creating situations in which people attempt to establish a relationship with the environment, reenter the natural world, and try to preserve the environment by being near it. Upon realizing that there is an inherent, unavoidable separation between humans and wilderness, humans encounter environmental ethics and deal with their individual guilt regarding the state of the environment. Characters in the novel attempt to bridge the separation by taming the wild, eventually leading to the environment’s demise.

During the part of the novel that takes place in the 1980’s, many of the characters spend their time trying to reenter nature. The characters’ attitudes can be described as both nostalgic and concerned. For example, Ty and Andrea spend 30 days immersed in nature and live off the land, and Sierra lives in a tree for several years. Both of these actions are parts of the environmental movement and are intended to display a relationship between humans and nature and humanity’s desire to preserve wilderness. In the end, however, these actions are futile. Ty and Andrea ultimately leave nature, with no obvious outcomes resulting from their actions, and Sierra dies anticlimactically by falling out of the tree. These shortcomings are prevalent throughout the novel.

Boyle is able to effectively illustrate the dichotomy between humans and wild nature, by way of these failed human efforts to reenter nature. Humans may want to reenter nature and positively impact the environment, but their inherent separation from the natural world makes this impossible. Humans themselves are sensitive creatures with no effective defense mechanisms other than weapons of their own creation, making it nearly impossible for them to survive in wilderness completely unaided, for extended periods of time.

Boyle also uses Mac to critique the good intentions of humans to try to preserve and reenter the environment. Mac wants to save the animals nobody else wants, and he thinks that this is selfless and cool and brave (15). Boyle creates Mac’s menagerie to depict the complications that occur when humans try to interfere with the natural, wild world. Mac does not understand the intricacies of natural ecosystems and thinks that by intensely caring for these select animals, he can potentially make a difference. Mac and his guests essentially try to enter the wild, but rather than going out into the wilderness, they bring the wilderness inside. Mac’s intentions, however, are not in the best interest of the animals, and this hinders a potential relationship between humanity and nature.

Boyle critiques the selfish intentions of humans when he describes Mac’s egocentric character. Mac’s own memorabilia adorn his entire mansion, and Mac’s attitude reveals that his menagerie is for his own benefit, not the animals. Mac wants to appear cool and brave. While Mac may have established the closest physical relationship to the animals by living with them and even entering the same room as a hyena, Boyle illustrates that simply being physically close to the natural world does not mean that a healthy connection can be established. While Mac may be in close physical proximity to his animals, his selfish intentions and ignorance of complete ecosystem health hinders a meaningful reentry into the natural world.

Mac is further depicted as being far removed from wildlife with the names he gives to his animals. Because all of his animals are named after flowers, the animals’ unwieldy and wild nature is masked. The endearing names transform wild beasts into domesticated pets. Boyle critiques the lack of understanding the characters have of their surrounding environment, because the wildness of the animals is undermined. Interestingly, the names of Mac’s bodyguards are plain and impersonal. Because his bodyguards both have the same name, Al, there appears to be more of a separation between the humans and the more fancifully named animals. Boyle may do this to emphasize the absurdity of Mac’s menagerie and downplay the authority of humans over nature.

Boyle further describes the attitudes of humans toward the wild and their resulting relationship when describing why Ty cannot sleep. So this is why I can’t sleep – the animals. It was the animals all along. Lions in the basement, vultures round the indoor pool, the hyena in the gift-wrapping room on the second floor. It’s crazy, that’s what it is. And all the while the water is rising (141). Ty, in particular, has a difficult time dealing with all the environmental destruction he sees. He cannot sleep because he is aware that Mac’s efforts to save the animals are not genuine or effective. Mac is disconnected from the animals and Ty and Chuy are the animals’ main caretakers. Because of Ty’s experience as a radical environmentalist, he is able to form a deeper connection to wildlife than Mac, and loses sleep over the state of the menagerie. While the water is rising due to the floods, environmental degradation is also on the rise, both in the fictional book, and in today’s natural world.

In addition, by describing the odd living quarters of the animals, Boyle addresses the inherent separation between the animals and a human-created society. The extravagant nature of Mac’s mansion, including an indoor pool and gift-wrapping room, are polar opposite to the animals’ natural habitat. Boyle depicts the artificial habitat in Mac’s mansion as a microcosm of the artificial habitat humans have created in essentially every part of the world. Overall, while Mac has attempted to form some type of connection to the wild by keeping a menagerie, the separation of humanity from the wild prevents a nurturing relationship. Ty stays in the mansion, quite simply, because he has nowhere else to go.

While many of the characters do not appear to be overly concerned with the wild animals staying in the house, one of the reporters that arrives at the house after Mac’s death understands the gravity of the situation. Upon hearing that there are wild animals staying in the house, the reporter states, ‘Maybe you can explain it for me, because I think I’m missing something here – isn’t that dangerous?’ (279). While the people living in the house were, for the most part, oblivious to the fact that they were living in such a dangerous environment, an outsider did notice. Boyle is criticizing society’s false impressions of the natural world. When people become accustomed to their environment, for example wild animals living in their house, they lose the sense of wildness. When exotic animals are domesticated and kept as pets, people are surprised when the creature acts on instinct and bites them. The inherent separation between humans and wild animals needs to be acknowledged and embraced, rather than changed to suit human desires. When people tame and domesticate nature, there will be consequences and the reporter, as an outsider, is the only one that can see this.

The slaying of Mac demonstrates one of these consequences. If the wildness of nature is not respected and humanity’s inherent separation from the environment ignored, there will be consequences. These consequences of the tumultuous relationship between humans and the environment may not be experienced in the short-term, but will surely be experienced in the long-term. While humans may try to establish a healthy relationship with nature, the separation is inevitable. Mac was killed by the very creature he was trying to protect because he ignored the separation. Boyle is criticizing the oftentimes oblivious actions and attitudes of humans. As stated previously, Mac did not act to reverse any type of ecosystem destruction, but tried to save a select group of animals, which will never solve the plethora of environmental problems plaguing the world Boyle creates.

Mac, Andrea, Ty, and Sierra all try to enter and preserve the natural world in their unique ways, and shortly after come to terms with the unavoidable separation between humans and wilderness. There are several psychological effects caused by trying to preserve the environment despite the inherent separation. Because of the consequences of global warming and environmental destruction depicted in the novel, Ty becomes so guilt-stricken that he is completely consumed by it. I’m a mess and I know it. Jewish guilt, Catholic guilt, enviro-eco-capitalistico guilt: I can’t even expel gas in peace (135). Boyle is critiquing the ethical nature of the environmental movement. There is more to the movement than facts and figures, but a more intrinsic, emotional side to the movement. As is illustrated by the proceeding scenes in the book, people’s guilt does not actually do anything to improve the state of the environment. People need to actually take initiative and act if any progress is to be made. Although the dichotomy between humans and nature is apparent, human actions can still protect the environment and humans need to act in ways that do not ignore the separation, but embrace it.

Although environmental destruction does make many people feel guilty, certain circumstances prevent guilt. Boyle acknowledges this when he critiques the behavior of Ty and other inmates in prison. Of course, guilt itself is a luxury. In prison we didn’t concern ourselves overmuch about environmental degradation or the rights of nature…and if the world collapsed as a result, all the better: at least we’d be out (135). Ty’s attitude evolved from optimistic to apathetic. People lack concern for the environment for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons are selfishness, lack of vision for the future, and simply the lack of resources to reduce ecological footprints. A Friend of the Earth tackles all of these reasons.

For example, because the prisoners themselves are removed from the environment, they do not have any motivation to preserve it. This is in contrast to Ty and Andrea trying to reenter nature to help preserve it, although ultimately failing. Oftentimes, people living in urban environments, people removed from a more natural environment, do not have as much of a connection to the land as people living off the land for sustenance. Because people who are removed from the environment do not necessarily see environmental degradation first hand, they have no incentive to try to conserve. It is necessary to establish a relationship with nature and truly understand its intricacies in order to preserve it, and this is not possible when one is imprisoned.

Another widespread reason why people do not try to preserve the environment, in addition to being physically disconnected to it, is a lack of resources. Boyle’s depiction of the prisoners tackles this issue as well. The prisoners do not have control over the food they eat or the way the facility is run, therefore their attitudes toward the environment likely differ from their attitudes in an environment where they were free to make their own decisions. Boyle’s depiction of prisoners may be considered analogous to poverty-stricken people in today’s society. One major issue facing the environmental movement is the expensive nature of preservation and conservation. In a lot of ways, poverty-stricken families have bigger problems to deal with than people who have the means to live comfortably. For example, paying bills and putting food on the table is a higher priority for many people than saving the environment. Furthermore, buying organic foods and recycled products is usually more expensive than buying virgin products, so many people simply cannot afford to be as environmentally friendly as others. Simply stated, economics may prevent a connection between people and the environment, hindering conservation.

Ty’s attitude towards the environment continues to evolve throughout the novel. Ty first tries to reenter nature, deals with the inherent separation and resulting guilt, and finally tries to bridge the separation. Many humans have tried to bridge the gap between wilderness and the human-built world, and this has been done through domestication. Humans have persistently tried to tame nature to satisfy their own lifestyle. While many enjoy the natural world, there are certain wild aspects of it that some people cannot tolerate. For example, people have suppressed fires and removed wolves to allow humans a comfortable existence within the environment, while still enjoying some aspects of nature.

Boyle criticizes this taming of nature to bridge the separation when Ty states, Petunia is not a dog. She’s a Patagonian fox. Above all, I’ve got to remember that. It seems important. It’s the kind of distinction that will be vitally important in the life to come… (336). In his fictional depiction of the world in the 1980’s, Boyle addresses the attitudes’ of people that want to keep nature wild. For example, Sierra wants to prevent the felling of an old growth tree. Ty wants to remember that Petunia is, in fact, a wild animal and not a domesticated pet. While at one point Ty recognizes the importance of keeping nature wild, he ultimately tames it at the end of the novel. Ty domesticates Petunia, because the fox is one of the last remnants of a wilderness that no longer exists. Ty yearns for some sort of relationship with the natural world. The taming of Petunia parallels the ultimate ending of the book: the environment has been so greatly degraded, that the entire natural world is essentially tamed. While nature is resilient and plant communities begin to reestablish themselves, the environment has lost its sense of wildness.

At the end of the novel, Boyle critiques the unavoidable separation between humans and nature once more. He addresses humanity’s desire to have a relationship with nature, while taming it to suit their needs. Boyle does this by describing the actions of Ty and Andrea upon returning to the Sierras. We crush carpenter ants, battle wasps, chase mice and birds and bats back out into the wild, where they belong. Andrea…comes back with sixteen precut and measured windowpanes and wields the putty like a glazier’s apprentice (348). Ty and Andrea remove the wild from their domicile, and separate themselves from the natural world through the walls of their house. Boyle makes a point of describing Andrea’s actions in putting windows in. While Ty and Andrea may be physically separated from the natural world that surrounds them, it is still visible through the window. This is important because while they are partially separated, there is still a connection between them and nature.

Boyle’s entertaining novel describes the attitudes of humans toward the environment and their resulting relationship. Through his creation of humorous scenes and characters, Boyle describes humanity’s attempt to reenter the wilderness. The struggle that follows this attempt at reentry illustrates the inherent and unavoidable separation between humans and wild, untamed nature. The inability of humans to connect with nature and preserve it in a way that addresses ecosystem function may lead to guilt, but the resulting guilt does not lead to action. Finally, Boyle addresses yet another attitude of humans toward the environment, when Ty tries to reconnect to the natural world and takes Petunia as a pet. The separation between humans and nature, however, will always be present and it is up to humans to overcome that separation if natural ecosystems are to be preserved. It is the responsibility of citizens and industry to protect the environment, because a healthy environment is essential to human emotional and physical well-being, in both Boyle’s fictional world and the society in which we live today.",0,0,0,8.75,15927
English,Report,Undergraduate,MacBeth by Roman Polanski,"Unlike many other versions of this famous Shakespearean play, Roman Polanski did not intend to incite sympathy for MacBeth, but rather preferred to emphasize the barbarity and ruthless violence of the title character through his use of disturbing visual imagery and voiceover. Many of MacBeth's soliloquies express his inner torment and emotion so as to garner the favor of the audience. But in Polanski's version, most of these speeches are inner monologues that are portrayed through voice over, so that it is obvious that these thoughts are only inside MacBeth's mind, and are not intended for anyone else to hear. In this regard, MacBeth appears as a more immoral character when he does not vocalize his lamentations, because by keeping them in his own head, he is not making his regrets real. They are confined only to his own imagination. Polanski's take on MacBeth thus highlights the depravity of this overly ambitious man, in that his black and deep desires remain to rot within himself. This scenario is repeated in the beginning after MacBeth is pronounced prince by the rightful king, and also after MacBeth receives news of the impending English force, as he paces the castle while surrounded by his followers.

Polanski utilized the tactic of inserting disturbing visual images such as a severed hand, rape, animal fights, bloody corpses, etc. in order to add a more macabre tone to the film. By doing this, he overshadowed any goodness that Shakespeare may have originally intended for the play. In Polanski's world of Shakespeare, MacBeth is not a victim of ambition, but rather, an embodiment of the violent consequences of ruthless ambition.

Several scenes add an eerie and supernatural feel to the film, such as the scene in which MacBeth enters the dining room only to find the table full with visitors. But something is not quite right, and Polanski elicits the viewer to notice this by holding the shot for longer than normal. What we notice after this unnatural length of view is the grey figure of the slain Banquo seated in the middle of the table, his back facing MacBeth. What ensues is a horrifying and hallucinatory scene in which MacBeth stumbles backwards, and while shouting, becomes a small figure in the middle of the steps. MacBeth is in the middle/bottom of the camera screen, and his figure is dwarfed by the large setting behind him as the camera pans out. On the other hand, the image of the dead Banquo is now disfigured and covered in blood and floats above the ground. His figure appears larger than life (or death, ha ha) as the camera shoots his figure as a close up from below. The transition between these two visual images insinuates how weak and vulnerable MacBeth is to overpowering supernatural torment of his own mind.

I believe that Polanski's interpretation of MacBeth captured an essence of the original work that is sometimes obscured by the humanity that many interpretors try to attribute to the title character. Polanski did not try to attribute all the blame and evil to Lady MacBeth, but rather attributed equal guilt (if not more) to MacBeth himself. With the explicit violence and gory images, Polanski successfully highlighted the brutality of ambition and the evil inherent in uncompromising individualistic gain. This blatant carnage added a supernatural feel to an almost natural film.",0,0,0,0,3353
English,Response Paper,Undergraduate,Julie Taymor's Titus,"Modern cinema possesses the ability to present Shakespeare in ways that contemporaries of the Bard could only dream of. But with greater artistic scope comes greater variation in the interpretation of the texts, such as found in Julie Taymor's Titus, adapted from Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. Taymor chooses to create a Shakespearean realm where Roman times blend with the modern age in a game-like arena. Taymor uses this game-type world to play with cinematic perspectives by inserting a young boy from the modern age as a third party observer, eventually bringing him into the narrative by assigning him the role of Titus' grandson. The boy allows for the audience to become aware of its viewing presence, reminding us that this ostentatious display of violence and revenge is staged for our viewing pleasure. It is like a game in which we lose ourselves, but are occasionally taken back to our position as spectator.

How does the final act of Titus Andronicus blend the stage and cinema, the game sphere, and modernity? What tools does Taymor use in order to create this surreal environment? The dinner scene perhaps best illustrates the use of cinema as subject. The final act begins with the two grotesque cannibalistic pies cooling in a window sill, a scene that harks back to 1930s America, complete with upbeat jazzy music. The entire scene is quite theatrical, as Titus makes his grand entrance dressed as a chef to serve his guests their deadly dinner. During the moment when Lucius kills the emperor, the entire theatrical dinner is suddenly paused while the camera, in a fashion reminiscent of The Matrix, swivels around this moment frozen in time. The guests are then abruptly transplanted back to the Roman amphitheatre in which the movie began. We now see an audience composed of seemingly real and modern people, who look on detachedly from the horrible scene of carnage before them. Reading Donaldson's article, I learned that this audience was Croatian—people who recently experienced one of the most violent and barbaric wars known in recent history (The Wars of Yugoslav Succession).

This final act showcases the all of the components in this unreal world: the cinema, the theatre, reality and modernity, and the game sphere. Both the boy, who has been the symbol of the viewer, and the addition of a real audience, which slaps us in the face to remind us of our viewing presence, now place the actors and the cinema as the focus of the film. The film itself has become the subject as all three audiences watch together, simultaneously. Together, we all watch on—in horror and detachment—as the carnage finally concludes with brutal on stage murders of four primary players. The beauty in the film is the violence itself, and how by using the cinema as the subject, Taymor is able to allow her audience to consciously watch the ensuing violence in a manner that both appalls and entertains. She makes a mockery of the brutality by showing how ridiculous and barbaric it is when we are able to watch from this perspective.",0,0,0,0,3047
Biology,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Invading the territory of invasives: the dangers of biotic disturbance,"New York City, 1908: different colors of skin swirl in the great melting pot to produce a cultural medley. Now imagine such a metropolis spreading to cover every last crevice on Earth. Over time, people will weave to produce an unprecedented uniformity; once discrete identities would be lost. Our heritages will be remembered only by the history texts in the hands of our progeny. A similar effect can be observed in environmental systems: we are in danger of losing our global biodiversity to a monotonous fate. The threat of invasive species is now greater than the world has ever witnessed. The number of introductions caused by international commerce is enormous (Mooney and Cleland, 2001). Although only a small portion of emigrants survive, those survivors have aggregated to form a giant global problem of bioinvasions (Mack et al., 2000). Extensive studies have been done on many exotics, such as the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and their biological and ecological threats prompt human interest and intervention (Facon et al., 2006). Environmentalists advocate the awareness of invasive species and governments spend millions to purge them. However, species removal is not as simple as it seems; we must be aware that the removal of an invasive causes ecosystem disturbance, just like its introduction, and hasty action can cause irreparable damage to our global asset of biodiversity. Extensive and specific studies of the risks and rewards of invasive species removal should be done before any actions to control a bioinvasion.

The greatest danger in dealing with invasive species involves risks in disturbing an ecosystem, especially one that's already threatened by an exotic. There are many studies being done on the effects of these unwanted immigrants, but precise mechanisms for these ecological disturbances are still unclear (Mack et al., 2000). Even less understood are the consequences of their removal. A study on the effects of introduced trout on frogs showed that native populations can dramatically rebound upon extirpation of the invasive predator (Vredenburg 2004). However, studies like this may not have strong implications on the majority of bioinvasions. This study was carried out in isolated mountain pools. With the exception of the introduced trout, these ecosystems have had minimal disturbance and human contact. This is quite different from many other bioinvasions that happen in peoples' backyards.

Insufficient understanding of invasive mechanisms can have catastrophic ramifications. In French Polynesia, the predatory land snail Euglandina rosea was deemed a fix to the economical threats of the giant African land snail Achatina fulica. Convinced by experiences with A. fulica in Hawaii, a hasty French Polynesian government set this invasive control project into action (O'Foighil 2006). The resultant extinction of nearly all endemic Partulid species is a painful lesson today (Coote and Loeve, 2003). Hawaii and French Polynesia are both pacific archipelagos, but their differing ecosystems led to the tragedy of the Partulids. Thus historical precedence cannot always be generalized and applied to foreign problems. Specific studies of any target invasive and ecosystem must be done before drastic actions are carried out.

The removal process itself is extremely tedious and in some cases near impossible. The removal of trout from five isolated lakes in Sixty Lake Basin of California took six years (Vredenburg 2004). Similar cleansing of downstream lakes that could receive upstream fish would require even greater efforts. In the case of E. rosea in French Polynesia, removal is thought to be impossible. The carnivorous snail has infested every corner of numerous French Polynesian islands, eliminating any possibility of Partulid reintroduction (Coote and Loeve 2006).

The ability of bioinvaders to hybridize with native species to produce a spectrum of pseudo-exotics exacerbates difficulties faced. This is most common among plants, which can also undergo extremely rapid evolution (Callaway and Maron, 2006): in England native species of the genus Senecio have readily hybridized with exotics to produce offspring that have taken over the country (Facon et al. 2006). In such cases, total extirpation of non-natives would require the elimination of more than one species and looms as a truly daunting task. As can be seen, removal projects are not always pragmatic or even possible. Studies like the English Senecio project help elicit the mechanisms for bioinvasion and gauge the practicality of control projects so we do not waste effort on an impossible task. Similar research should be done on all exotics before invasive removal projects.

The economic costs of invasive species total over one hundred billion dollars a year in the United States alone, and millions more are spent to control or eliminate them (Mack et al., 2006). However, the benefits of such projects aren't always clear even upon completion. We assume the noble goal of restoring a native ecosystem, yet actual outcomes can be less-than-equitable compromises. In the mid 20th century the United States government extirpated arctic foxes that had been introduced to the Aleutian archipelago fifty years earlier (Croll et al., 2005). Now half a century later, once fox-infested islands still bear the scars of the bioinvasion despite the success of the fox removal project. Seabirds are slow to recolonize the once dangerous islands, and the lack of guano leaves them under blankets of tundra. Again, research to understand the mechanisms of bioinvasions could have helped predict this outcome and prevent implementation of such wasted efforts.

We launch invasive removal projects to save the natives; however, are we actually helping them by removing an invasive? Environments that have been exposed to an exotic for sufficiently long periods have reestablished equilibrium: species have developed adaptations to cope with their new neighbors. Off the coast of New England, mussels exposed to predatory crabs develop thicker shells as protection (Freeman and Byers, 2006). In Australia, snakes evolved smaller relative head sizes to cope with the introduced toxic cane toads (Phillips and Shine, 2004). These morphological changes represent investments to increase fitness in altered habitats. The energy cost of these features is balanced by an increased ability to survive. By removing invaders, we are eliminating the benefits of their adaptations. These disturbances would leave the native species with just the adverse costs of thickened shells and smaller heads. In dealing with bioinvasions, we must consider not only the native species, but also the dynamic ecosystems. Disturbances can draw out unforeseen effects; like the fox removal project in Alaska, a disturbance with the noblest of purposes can fall short of recovery.

Invasive species are a threat to the world's biodiversity, but their removal can be just as hazardous. Even with the right goal, without proper planning and sufficient studies to understand target ecosystems, projects in invasive removal can prove futile or even produce dire consequences. Fortunately for Partulids in French Polynesia, at least one extant member of each endangered clade has been discovered and some hope of recovery still exists (O'Foighil 2006). Yet many organisms have no immediate relatives: the dead clades walking are survivors of past mass-extinction events and their loss would be irreparable (Jablonski 2001).

When controlling the global problem of invasive species, prevention outshines restoration. Most modern invasives are spread by artificially, either as unwitting stowaways or intentional imports. However for the average citizen, the awareness of biodiversity is often masked by personal, political, and economic concern. The threat of bioinvasions must be publicized and personalized. Only thru the aggregation of countless personal efforts can a global threat be contained. In New Zealand, invasive trout are a publicly supported economic boon (Townsend 2003). Any extensive lobbying for the continued existence of a species is admirable. If people were just as aware of the value in their endemic biodiversity, curbing the spread of exotic species would take an easier turn.",0,0,4.14,2.68,8292
Biology,Proposal,Undergraduate,Exploring the Molecular Responses of Arabidopsis in Hypobaric Environments: Identifying Possible Targets for Genetic Engineering,"Abstract
Environmental stresses to plants have been studied extensively in order to define mechanisms that are used by plants to defend against the stress. The focus of these studies includes drought, cold, heat, salinity, and hypoxia. However, space flights and theoretical missions to the moon and Mars require a low pressure environment to be considered. Plants will be essential in future space mission because they will be included in life support systems designed for astronauts. The molecular mechanisms used by plants to survive in a hypobaric environment are poorly understood, but recent studies have shown that a plant may borrow mechanisms from other stress responses to defend against the low pressures. Research has found that hypoxia, cold, and drought responses seem to be involved in a plant experiencing hypobaria. My studies seek to profile the gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana during a week long period of time in a low pressure environment by doing a transcriptome analysis. This information will give insight into when the necessary genes are activated or repressed, and the duration of the gene activity will reflect its importance in the stressful situation. It will also provide additional evidence of defense pathways that are shared between the stresses. It has also been shown that low pressures may cause plants to activate a defense response that is unneeded. The cold and drought responses are highly activated in Arabidopsis submitted to low pressures, but the plants showed no signs of wilting, browning, or loss in turgor pressure. This suggests that the plants perceive a lack of humidity and water, but in actuality the plants have enough amounts of water. My second study will attempt to block the defense responses to desiccation stress by creating mutant strains of Arabidopsis with non-functional transcription factors, and seeing the effect on the plants. CBFs and ABIs are known to bind to promoters in order to induce genes that control the production of LEA and COR proteins. By genetically engineering the reduction of the unneeded pathways, the plants will be able to save resources for other important functions.

Introduction
There has been a considerable amount of research done on the effects of environmental stresses such as drought, hypoxia, or heat stress, on plants. And for good reason too, as environmental stresses can reduce the growth rates of plants and decrease crop yields drastically. By studying the changing genome when plants acclimate to a new environment, we can devise biotechnological or genetic techniques to promote plant survival in the stressful conditions (1, 6). For example, by over-expressing LEA proteins, which are responsible for protecting against water deficits, rice gained improved resistance to salinity and drought (6). However, while we know a lot about mechanisms in various extremes, very little is known about the molecular responses of plants to low atmosphere pressures (1). Although this may seem trivial, the significance of hypobaric environments comes into play when the need to grow plants in space, moons, or planets arises. The growth of plants in space is a priority for NASA, since plants will be essential in long-term bioregenerative life support systems for astronauts (1, 3, 7). Greenhouses can be built to provide a somewhat controlled environment, but creating Earth-like pressures is near impossible and highly impractical, thus the ability of plants to tolerate low pressures will be necessary (1,4). Altered atmospheric pressures have been shown to have adverse as well as favorable affects on plant growth, though in all cases extensive adaptations need to happen (4, 7, 9). There is evidence that defense pathways for multiple stresses will simultaneously activate since low pressures will create an environment where: hypoxia can occur since oxygen will be limiting due to a lower partial pressure of oxygen outside of the plant (1, 4, 5, 7); cold and drought stress is perceived because of the lower vapor pressure, and thus lower water potential, outside plant cells (1, 4, 6, 7); heat stress could occur due to lowered conductive and convective cooling via transpiration, which would occur if the plant ceased respiration and closed stomata to defend against desiccation (1, 6). Because of the combined stresses, the final defense mechanism used by the plant can be very different from when it is only dealing with one stress. It has been shown that the combination of stresses, such as drought and heat, causes a distinct response from when the plant is exposed to either drought or heat alone (2). Genes that are expressed during a single stress may be repressed when exposed to a second stress. Similarly, genes repressed with a single stress, can become active when there are multiple stresses present (2). Hypobaric environments could trick plants into triggering multiple defense pathways, which in some ways could be agonistic or antagonistic to one another. An example of how pathways may be opposing is as following: when plants are under desiccation stress, plant cells will form compatible solutes such as proline or sugars to lower the water potential inside the cell, and also synthesize major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) such as aquaporins to increase water uptake (2, 6). When a plant is facing hypoxic conditions, which often occurs due to flooding, there is a major reduction in the MIPs present (5). If hypobaria does activate hypoxia pathways and drought pathways, then it will be interesting to watch the plant decide to increase or decrease the level of MIPs. There are an innumerable other examples of pathways which may complement each other or work against each other, and so one goal of my research would be to identify the pathways involved in a plant experiencing hypobaria. Additionally, it has been shown that when grown at one-tenth of Earth's atmospheric pressure, plants induce genes to defend against desiccation and hypoxia even though the plants were grown in a humid environment with plenty of water (4). The plants showed no loss in fresh weight or turgor pressure, so it suggests that the plants perceive low pressures as increased water loss. To accommodate for this, the plants start undergoing alternate metabolic and adaptation pathways. However, if these pathways aren't really needed, then the plant is wasting energy that it could use for growing and reproducing. The second goal of my research is to identify what stress responses I can knockout or knockdown, so that the plants can thrive in the environment without any slowdown.

Experiment 1
The plant of choice for my experiments will involve Arabidopsis thaliana, since the most is known about its genome, and almost every previous research study done on plant stresses has used Arabidopsis. To compare my results with them, I will also use Arabidopsis. To start off, I want to grow seedlings in a Low-Pressure Growth Chamber (LPGC) as done by Paul et al. and Musgrave et al. (4, 9). Unlike the previous two experiments, I will set the pressure even lower to 2 kPa, which is slightly above the average atmospheric pressure of 1 kPa on Mars (3, 7). The lowest pressure possible for plant survival is estimated to be around 1 kPa; this value takes into account the minimal partial pressures of water vapor, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide needed by plants (8). I want to avoid going to the extreme low end to steer clear of unexpected complications. Since hypoxia is inevitable in low pressures, I will fix the air flowing through the LPGC to have an oxygen concentration of 9 mmol/L. At this concentration, I expect plant growth and respiration to be normal or even enhanced as described by Musgrave et al. (9). If necessary, a higher concentration of oxygen could be used if the seedlings continued to struggle with hypoxia. The other Martian conditions such as sunlight availability, atmospheric composition, and lower gravity are presumably not obstacles to plant growth as long as a greenhouse is providing an environment with optimal levels of CO2, O2, and UV protection (8). For my control, I will grow seedlings at the normal Earth pressure of 101 kPa. Past data has already shown that low atmospheric pressures do not negatively affect plant growth from a visual standpoint (1, 4, 9). The plants seem to tolerate the low pressures very well, and show no signs of wilting or loss of growth when germinated at low pressures; instead the plants are actually experiencing enhanced growth in many scenarios. To determine how the seedlings are altering their biochemical pathways to acclimate to a low pressure environment, I will use a microarray to do a transcriptome analysis on the hypobaric plants and control plants. I will utilize the same GeneChip for the Arabidopsis genome as used by Paul et al. in their experiment (4). Instead of just using tissue from the shoots of the plants however, I will also collect leaf tissue, and root tissue as well. This way I can see if there is differential expression between tissues. Detecting mRNA for a gene does not necessarily mean that it is being translated, but it will give insight on how the plant is preparing to defend against a stress. By comparing the microarrays from the control and hypobaric plants, it will be possible to tell which genes are differently expressed in the hypobaric plant. I will label mRNA from the control plant red, and mRNA from the hypobaric plants green. On the microarray, areas that are only green are genes uniquely expressed by hypobaric plants, yellow areas are genes expressed by both plants, and red areas are genes that are inferably repressed in hypobaric plants. I will be doing a time-course for gene expression microarrays by taking the RNA samples at different time intervals (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours, and 24 hours) and then taking a final RNA sample a week after germination. The purpose of the time-course is to make sure we aren't overlooking genes that are being activated or repressed early in the stages of adaptation or late in the stages. Additionally, the Paul et al. experiment used 10 kPa whereas I'm using 2 kPa, so the effects of the lower pressure on the genome have yet to be seen. I expect to see a similar result as described in the Paul et al. experiment (4), but an added time-course will show if these genes they listed are activated from the start or at different times. With this information, we can identify which genes are crucial for the first step towards adaptation to a low pressure environment. Also, genes that become activated from the start and stay active throughout the whole process are more likely to be essential for dealing with stresses. For example, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is an enzyme that is essential for glycolysis to proceed, and since glycolysis is upregulated during times of stresses, I would expect much higher levels of ADH in the hypobaric plants the whole time (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). Identifying genes that are repressed is equally important, because certain genes can be harmful to the plant during a time of stress. For example, when dealing with drought stress, plants activate pathways to create higher levels of proline in the cell in order to lower the water potential among other reasons (6). But when faced with drought stress and heat stress, the pathways creating proline is repressed, and pathways creating sucrose and glutamine are induced instead since proline is thought to interfere with the heat stress response (2). After a week in the hypobaric environment, the seedling will have acclimated to the new low pressure environment, so the transcriptome produced at that time period will most likely reflect the final mechanisms the Arabidopsis seedlings are using. At the 24 hour time period and week time periods, I will use RT-PCR in order to quantify the degree of transcription for the hypobaria-induced clusters of genes as well as other genes of interest such as genes involved in glycolysis, C4 pathway, photorespiration, and aerobic respiration. The RT-PCR method I use will be the same one used by Paul et al. (4). I expect higher levels of mRNA for genes belonging to a hypoxic stress response, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and other genes in the fermentation pathway, as well as higher levels of genes corresponding to a drought stress response, such as LEA proteins and COR proteins, in the hypobaric plants than in the controls. I'm also interested in examining whether the levels of certain transcription factors (CBFs and ABIs) are raised. These transcription factors are essential in a drought stress response, and will be important in my second experiment (1, 6, 10). Seeing if Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) rise in levels will be important as well for future experiments. I hypothesize that by the week time-period, the levels of mRNA in the hypobaria-induced cluster will have risen, or possibly dropped, to their optimal level (I will compare the expression between the week time-period and the 24 hour period). It is possible for mRNA levels for defense genes to rise in number, and then decline as time progresses as seen in the hypoxic stress response (5). Microarrays and RT-PCR will give us a much more comprehensive picture of what is happening in the hypobaric stress response. To end the first experiment, I will use Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer to investigate the results of my microarray experiment as done by Liu et al. (5). With this program, I will be able to identify biological themes within the gene list, identify the molecular functions and localization of gene products present, and I will have a more in depth perspective into the possible biochemical/metabolical pathways that are occurring as part of the stress response for hypobaria. The information provided from the first experiment will greatly increase understanding of the responses necessary to defend against low pressures, and will also help immensely in the design of genetically engineered plants for space missions.

Experiment 2
There have been countless observations that when plants are pre-acclimated to stressful environments, such as heat shock, hypoxia, or drought, the plants acquire a sort of tolerance to that stress (1, 6). A major strategy in creating plants that are pre-acclimated to a stress would be to engineer them to constitutively express genes that are responsible for the adaptive response (1). This might include introducing genes which take part in the adaptive response, or introducing genes coding for transcription factors to activate multiple genes that are part of the response. While this strategy will be useful for dealing with the hypoxia stress response and heat stress response, it could be ineffective with the cold and drought stress responses that the plants are exhibiting during hypobaria. When grown at 10kPa, Arabidopsis plants showed no signs of wilting, browning, or other symptoms of desiccation stress, even though the defense pathways for cold and drought stresses were being activated (4). If the desiccation response isn't necessary for adaptation to low pressure, and really is a side effect of the plant perceiving low pressures as lower humidity, then the induction of the pathways is causing a drain on metabolism. My second experiment would be to investigate how important the desiccation stress response actually is. I will do this by blocking the response pathways responsible for reacting to the stresses, and then growing the mutant plants in the LPGC at 2 kPa. Two classes of proteins have been identified as the major players in cold and drought stress. The LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) genes are important in the response against desiccation, and the COR (cold responsive) genes are vital in the response against freezing temperatures (1, 6). Since cold and drought stress are related stresses, as both cause water deficits, it is not uncommon to see both stresses sharing defenses. One way to knockdown the expression of the LEA and COR proteins would be to stop the activation of their promoters. There are two main pathways to activate these promoters: one that is dependent on the hormone ABA, and one independent of it. I will try to inhibit both pathways individually, and then at the same time. Since blocking ABA independent pathways is easier, it will be my first target. Numerous cold-induced genes and water-deficit genes are controlled by transcription factors, called CBFs (C-repeat binding factor) or DREBPs (DRE-binding protein), that bind to a DRE cis-element on the promoter (1, 6). I will create, or purchase, mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional CBFs/DREBPs. The preferred method of mutation would be gene knockouts so that the plants do not transcribe the mRNA, and thus no chance of translating the transcription factors. Silencer RNA would be a second option, but since it is more of a knockdown instead of a knockout, proteins could still sporadically be expressed. Also, I would have to apply the siRNA to all the tissues multiple times during the experiment. Without the proper transcription factors, almost none of the ABA-independent stress response genes could be activated. For example, CBF3 causes the activation of a few COR proteins and the activation of pathways to form compatible solutes such as proline and sugars to protect against water loss (1, 6). CBF1 has been shown to increase the expression of all of the COR proteins, showing its great importance (1, 6). By mutating the CBF/DREBP family of transcription factors, the stress response will be severely diminished and resources will be free to use for other cell functions. Similarly, ABA-induced genes have cis-elements on the promoter to bind different transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, the ABRE (ABA-responsive element) and CE (coupling element) sites bind ABI transcription factors, which are activated after an ABA signal-transduction event (6). I will create, or purchase, mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional ABI1 and ABI3 transcription factors since this combination totally disrupts desiccation stress responses (10). The method of mutation will be the same as above. Even though the ABI transcription factors aren't necessary for all of the water-deficit response genes, their loss of function will definitely reduce the quantity of LEA proteins and other desiccation induced proteins in the cell. For example, there are 5 groups of LEA proteins, and the ABI3 transcription factor is responsible for activating at least Group 4 LEA proteins, but Group 2 LEA proteins do not require ABI3 (6). Once again, the reduction of superfluous proteins will free up resources for other cell processes. The last part of the experiment will involve creating mutant Arabidopsis plants with dysfunctional CBFs, ABI1, and ABI3. This strain will lack any sort of protection against the cold or desiccation, so the water source and temperature will be carefully monitored (10). If the plants grow at least somewhat normally after blocking the cold and drought pathways, then it will be a good idea to further pursue methods to permanently block the unneeded responses of cold and desiccation protection in the plants with a high possibility of being sent to Mars. If the desiccation response is necessary, then it is very possible to enhance desiccation tolerance via genetic engineering or other biotechnological methods to increase production at low pressures.

There are a lot more was to help plants cope with low pressures. For example, if the desiccation response and ABA is causing stomata to close, then it hinders the plant's ability to exchange gases like CO2, and photorespiration could occur. By blocking this response, perhaps the plants will have a more normal respiration rate. Also, investigation into the role of Heat Shock Proteins in hypobaric plants is another possible route. This project will serve as a model for future projects to engineer plants to thrive in hypobaric environments.",0,0,4.88,16.28,20027
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,The Ecology and Epidemiology of Plague,"Introduction
Throughout history, plague has been made infamous as the ultimate biological killer. The word is now synonymous with any particularly contagious, lethal, and uncontrollable epidemic. However, the true plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, has largely been ignored in recent years. Many people think of plague as an extinct disease of the Middle Ages, a horrifying tale from history class that has been eliminated from society through time and technology. Of course, this is not the case. Although plague, like many other diseases, has been eliminated from industrial countries, it continues to afflict most parts of the world. In fact, just last month, pneumonic plague killed over 60 people in a recently reopened diamond mine in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The situation is even more dangerous because DRC is close to the border of Sudan, where a long civil war and political unrest in Darfur are forcing many refugees to escape to neighboring countries under unsanitary conditions.

The lack of concern about plague in the developed world also presents another complication to preventing its spread; while treatments and vaccines for plague exist, they are not widely distributed, and knowledge about them has decreased considerably. In the Middle Ages, the Europeans were much more susceptible to this newly introduced infection than those in the tropics. The developed world faces the same situation today, since very few people have developed antibodies to fight off the infection. The insidious character of this bacterium, combined with the lack of preparedness to face such an outbreak, might make plague an ideal agent for bioterrorists seeking death and major havoc. Even without this bioweapon potential, plague is still a widely occurring but poorly understood disease. It is therefore important to return to a scientific study of the bacterium, particularly in understanding how it spreads and what measures can be taken to control its threat.

The majority of literature on plague dates back to the Middle Ages, when the disease was much more rampant. While studies of plague were scarce in the 18th-19th centuries, there was resurgence in interest at the turn of the 20th century when a major pandemic hit Asia. Subsequently, though, interest in and literature on the disease has disappeared. There has been virtually no coverage of the topic in major scientific journals, including those in parasitology. The most recent epidemiological works on plague date from the 1970s and early 1980s, but the information in these texts is still considered accurate by most parasitologists today. This paper will therefore concentrate on these books and reports, while occasionally including new information from more recent articles.

The essay will begin with a brief historical analysis of plague outbreaks, and then explore plague's geographical distribution, with the goal of understanding where the disease originated and how this might affect population resistance. Then, the organisms involved in plague ecology will be discussed in detail: the first is the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis; next are several of the common flea and other arthropod vectors of the disease; subsequently the small mammalian reservoir hosts of plague will be considered, concentrating on rats but also with a discussion of campestral foci; finally, methods of human infection with the plague bacterium and its effects are investigated. After understanding the ecology of plague, preventative and control measures at each stage of the infectious cycle and their effectiveness are examined. Finally, social and political questions about plague are raised, particularly its threat as a bioterrorist weapon and the role of international health policy in eradicating this disease.

A Brief History of Plague
The bubonic plague pandemic of the 14th century, more commonly referred to as the Black Death or Great Dying, is probably the most well known and documented health disaster in history. It is also suspected to be the first example of bioterrorism. According to historical accounts, the epidemic started in 1348, when Mongol invaders from central Asia started mysteriously dying aboard ships entering the Mediterranean (Norris, 1977). Upon reaching port in Genoa, in the northwestern part of Italy, the Mongols decided to rid themselves of these bodies by catapulting the infected corpses over the fortressed walls of the city. While this story is rather sensational, several important conclusions stem from it. Rats are notorious as stowaways on ships, and it is highly likely that rats native to Asia were able to make their way into Europe aboard these Mongol vessels, and thereby penetrate the city. Along with these rats came their parasites, the Oriental Rat Fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis). It is probable that these fleas were still clinging to the human corpses thrown into Genoa, and were able to colonize new rat populations. No matter what its origin, the effects of the Black Death on Europe are irrefutable. It is thought that between 1348-1350, at least 25% of the population of Europe was killed, with estimates ranging as high as 50% in certain cities, such as Florence (Rail, 1985).

The last known pandemic of plague in Europe was the Great Plague of London in 1665. Within a five week period in late August and September, over 38,000 people were killed, and by February 1666 close to 100,000 were dead in London alone (Gregg, 1985). More recently, plague has been found in virtually every part of the world, including North America. In the United States, plague was found in California in the early 20th century, and spread through the desert southwest into Louisiana and Florida. In almost all cases it occurred in rural foci, with ground squirrels as the reservoir host, and tended to remain in the southern states. In recent years (1980s-90s), isolated cases of plague have been found mostly in New Mexico.

The most recent epidemics of plague have occurred in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. India has been particularly susceptible to the disease over the centuries. Plague was endemic in northwest India in the late 1600s, but it gradually seemed to disappear. However, in the early 19th century it once again appeared in northern India, and in 1896, the last great plague pandemic started in Bombay, which had been free of plague for over 200 years (Rail, 1985). At this time, Bombay was a worldwide commercial port city, so the disease was able to spread rapidly to other parts of Asia and beyond through merchant ships and the rats that inhabited them. By the beginning of the twentieth century, plague had spread to Hong Kong, China, the Pacific islands, and finally into western North America, as noted above. Plague also spread to South Africa through the Indian shipping routes during this period, and cases have occurred throughout the continent. In recent years, isolated cases of plague have continued to occur in India and Africa. In 1994, 200 were killed in Surat, India (Gujurat State), and in 2002 16 cases were reported in an isolated village in Himachal Pradesh, in the Himalayan foothills (WHO, 2005). The largest recent outbreaks have occurred in central Africa, starting with 23 cases in Zambia in 2001, then moving northeast with 71 cases in Malawi in 2002 and 130 cases in the Congo in early 2005 (WHO, 2005).

Geographical Distribution
The geographic origin of plague has been controversial. Most epidemiologists believe that the disease emanated somewhere in Asia, though the precise location is still debated. John Norris's seminal treatise on this question argues that there are three distinct strains of plague that have different distributions (Norris, 1977). These strains are differentiated based on a) whether they can ferment glycerine and b) whether they can produce nitric acid. The strain of Yersinia pestis that is suspected to have caused the Black Death and most other medieval epidemics is able to ferment glycerine but does not produce nitric acid. It is postulated that this strain originated in the Tigris River valley, in what are now Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. It then spread north into trans-Caucasian Russia (now Armenia and Azerbaijan), and eastward to Central Asia, where trading routes and Mongol invasions introduced the strain into Western Europe. Meanwhile, the strain that has caused most recent plague outbreaks is one that does not ferment glycerine but does produce nitric acid. This strain started in India and Burma, then spread east into China through trade routes, and eventually to the Pacific coast of North America and to South Africa. The third strain, which has been the cause of the recent outbreaks in Central Africa, is one that can both ferment glycerine and produce nitric acid, and is likely to have evolved from the Middle-Eastern strain.

Glycerine production is significant in the virulence of the plague strain (Norris, 1977). Initially, all rodents in a campestral focus are equally susceptible to infection by the Y. pestis bacterium. However, as certain rodents develop antibodies to the bacterium, they no longer serve as suitable reservoir hosts, so the bacterium specializes in the more susceptible hosts. In the Middle East and central Asia, these hosts were hibernating rodents, such as marmots and voles. During their hibernation, these hosts produced large amounts of glycerine, which was then overcome by the development of a glycerine fermentation process in the plague bacterium. However, in south and east Asia rats are the prevalent rodents, and since these creatures do not hibernate, they do not produce glycerine, and this strain of Y. pestis therefore did not develop this fermentation process. It appears that the Middle Eastern strain of Y. pestis has a higher rate of proliferation than its counterpart, is more likely to enter the pulmonary system of its host, and is also resistant to penicillin, making it the far more deadly of the two strains (Norris, 1977). It is therefore likely that during the Black Death, the Y. pestis had recently made a host switch to non-hibernating rats from hibernating wild rodents.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2005), the world distribution of plague between 1970-1998 was as follows: in Asia, countries that reported plague in this period included Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and additional zoonotic foci were found in northern Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In the Middle East, no plague cases were reported, but infected animals were found in Saudi Arabia, eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, and western Iran. Almost all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, and Uganda to South Africa, had reported plague, as well as Libya and Madagascar. There were also infected animals reported in Morocco and Western Sahara. Finally, in the New World, cases had been reported in the western United States and in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, with animals infected in Argentina and Paraguay.

Except for the strains in central Africa and central Asia, all existing plague cases are of the Indian variety, infecting non-hibernating rodents and lacking a biochemical mechanism for glycerine fermentation (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). This is supported by the fact that all these cases occur in the tropics and subtropical regions, where rodents do not need to hibernate. The medieval strain that caused the Black Death and that infected hibernating rodents in colder climates (such as Europe) has disappeared, except for isolated foci in the Caspian Sea region (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976).

The Yersinia pestis Bacterium
Yersinia pestis, formerly known as Pasteurella pestis, was first isolated and studied independently by Swiss microbiologist Alexandre Yersin and Japanese microbiologist Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1894 during the Hong Kong epidemic (Gregg, 1985). This bacterium is a non-motile, non-sporeforming, Gram-negative coccobacillus (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). Y. pestis is very fragile, and can be killed by heat-treatment at 55º C, chemical agents, sunlight, or extreme dryness (Stark et al., 1966). This is why the bacterium is generally not found in extremely arid environments, such as the Saharan Desert and the Middle East. Its optimum growth temperature is 28º C, so it prefers subtropical climates, but it has been found to grow in full nutrient broth at temperatures ranging from -2º C to 45º C (Stark et al., 1966). In vivo, where nutrients are available, its optimal growth temperature is 37º C, the body temperature of mammals (Rail, 1985).

Y. pestis grows optimally under 60% or higher humidity, so its incidence in tropical climates like India and Africa is low in the dry winter months and high in the monsoon season in late summer (Rail, 1985). Although studies have been conflicting on the ability of Y. pestis to survive outside of a host, it is generally accepted that the bacterium will not remain infective for more than a few months in the open. Bacteria remaining in the feces or carcasses of infected animals, though, can stay viable for a longer period (Rail, 1985). Y. pestis also requires certain metallic ions for proper growth. It multiplies faster in the presence of calcium. However, if magnesium concentrations are high, virulent Y. pestis requires less calcium to grow, and high concentrations of both calcium and magnesium cause the cells to swell and eventually lyse (Rail, 1985). Y. pestis also requires high levels of iron for reproduction, and iron concentrations in the reticulo-endothelial cells involved in pneumonic plague increased after infection (Rail, 1985). Moderate levels of selenium have been found to promote antibody formation against the plague bacterium in mammals, although high levels are toxic (Rail, 1985).

The Flea Vectors of Plague
The primary vectors of the plague bacterium are arthropods in the order Siphonaptera, the fleas. Fleas are laterally flattened, highly sclerotized, and wingless, with large coxal leg segments to allow them to jump long distances in order to attach to a host (Rail, 1985). Both sexes and most species within this order are blood-feeders of mammals (Rail, 1985). Fleas are holometabulous, with a non-parasitic larval stage that feeds on detritus. Fleas are nidiculous parasites as adults, preferring to live in the environment of a host due to their sensitivity to temperature and humidity (Rail, 1985).

Flea morphology is important in its vector potential for plague. The flea's foregut contains a chamber called the proventriculus, between the esophagus and stomach, where the blood meal is digested. When a Y. pestis bacterium enters the proventriculus, it releases a coagulating enzyme which forms a solid blood clot, creating a nutritious environment to facilitate bacterial growth (Gregg, 1985). This mass of dried blood and bacteria eventually blocks the proventricular valve (Stark et al., 1966). When this valve is blocked, the blood meal remains in the esophagus, never entering the stomach. Therefore, the flea feels starved and avidly seeks another blood meal from a new host. Upon feeding, the flea regurgitates the blood that has remained in its esophagus from the previous infected host into the new wound. This mechanism is particularly important in X. cheopis, because in most other flea species, particularly those targeting wild rodents, masses either have to cover the entire stomach to produce this effect, or there is no blockage at all (Stark et al., 1966). Sometimes, the bacterial mass undergoes autolysis and becomes dislodged, so normal feeding resumes (Stark et al., 1966). However, if this mass remains, the flea quickly dies from starvation, even as it constantly makes attempts to feed and subsequently infects many hosts with the plague bacterium.

There are two siphonapteran species that are the primary vectors of Y. pestis. The original vector is Xenopsylla cheopis, the Oriental rat flea of Asia (Rail, 1985). X. cheopis is the ideal vector for the bacterium because bacterial incubation is rapid, with blockage of the proventriculus occurring in 12-21 days (Stark et al., 1966). X. cheopis has optimal survival rates in moderately warm and moist climates, and prolonged heat is unfavorable (Stark et al., 1966). The preferred hosts for this species are rats that harbor underground (such as sewer rats). X. cheopis feeds many times a day for short intervals, and often lives within the fur of its host (Stark et al., 1966). Despite being an excellent vector, X. cheopis has a relatively short lifespan of 376 days (Rail, 1985), and since this lifespan can be further shortened by starvation, this flea can be more easily contained than some other species. A closely related species, Xenopsylla brasiliensis, is an even more efficient carrier of plague that occurs in temperate regions of Brazil and East Africa (Gregg, 1985).

The primary plague vector in the cooler areas of Europe and North America is the European rat flea Nosopsyllus fasciatus. It probably became a vector of plague through interactions with X. cheopis fleas that were introduced into southern Europe through trade routes to the Orient. N. fasciatus is about 1/3 as effective in transferring plague as X. cheopis (Gregg, 1985). However, several other characteristics make it a more lethal vector than X. cheopis. Its lifespan of 680 days is nearly twice as long as that of X. cheopis (Rail, 1985). Also, while it feeds for longer intervals, it also tends to stay off the host for longer periods (Stark et al., 1966), making it more difficult to control. This species is also amenable to feeding on hosts other than Rattus, and may serve as a link between urban and campestral foci of plague (Stark et al., 1966).

Other fleas can also be vectors for plague, although they are not as efficient as X. cheopis and N. fasciatus. The human flea Pulex irritans cannot readily transmit the plague bacterium individually. However, if large numbers of these very common fleas attack a host, transmission is much more likely (Stark et al., 1966). These fleas do not require rats or other rodents as reservoir hosts, and are considered an important interhuman transmitter of bubonic plague (before the disease reaches its contagious pneumonic form) (Stark et al., 1966). Ctenocephalides felis, the abundant 'cat flea' of domestic animals, also effectively transmits plague in large groups (Stark et al., 1966). These fleas are important in campestral settings, where domestic animals that get infected from wild rodents can bring the bacterium to human households. Finally, the sticktight flea Echidnophaga gallinacea is a relatively efficient transmitter of plague, with a similar infection rate to N. fasciatus (Stark et al., 1966). However, this parasite of poultry and rodents is relatively sessile, so it functions primarily to keep enzootic plague active in a campestral focus, and is not an important vector to humans.

Several other arthropods, including lice, bedbugs, and dipterans, are able to carry the plague bacterium in laboratory settings. However, these arthropods have never been shown to transmit the bacterium (Stark et al., 1966). The proventriculus of the flea is essential in Y. pestis transmission. The flea is already a much more active host-seeker than other arthropods, and blockage of the proventriculus and subsequent starvation of the flea makes it feed constantly. Also, the bacterium most efficiently enters the reservoir host through regurgitation by the flea during feeding, and this requires that the bacteria remain in the esophagus. While bacteria can remain viable in flea feces, even heavy fecal contamination of soil does not result in high human infection rates (Rail, 1985). Finally, fleas are more mobile than other arthropods, which are usually permanent or long-term ectoparasites of their hosts.

Mammalian Reservoir Hosts
Almost all fleas are parasites of warm-blooded mammals, though a few also parasitize birds. While all mammals can be targeted by plague-carrying fleas, carnivores (such as dogs and cats) are resistant to the bacterium (Stark et al., 1966). Small rodents, though, are highly susceptible to flea attacks. There are two environments where plague cycles can occur: urban and campestral settings. Research has suggested that plague originated in wild rodent reservoirs, and later moved to rats (Stark et al., 1966). The plague cycle is thought to have survived for millions of years in prairies, steppes, and meadows throughout the world (Gregg, 1985). In this cycle, fleas infected by the plague bacterium feed on wild rodent hosts. The rodent hosts die from the bacterium, but fleas that are still on the dead host move on to other hosts before they are killed by starvation. Since campestral fleas tend to be relatively non-host specific, they can move to several species, ensuring the continuation of the cycle even if a certain host species dies out. There are many wild reservoir hosts of plague, but only a few will be discussed here.

Mammals in the Family Sciuridae include marmots, squirrels, prairie dogs, and chipmunks (Stark et al., 1966). These animals are particularly important reservoirs in North America. Ground squirrels (Citellussp.) are not very social, and therefore are not naturally likely to be found near human habitations. However, they form vast underground networks and are widespread over large areas in the western U.S. Citellus townsendii, the sage squirrel, is distributed in the grasslands of the northwest in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Farther south, into western California, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, the striped and spotted ground squirrels (C. tridecemlineatus and C. spilosoma, respectively) are found (Stark et al., 1966). On the Pacific coast and into the Rockies, rock squirrels of the subgenus Otospermophilus are the primary reservoirs. All these species are heavily infected by fleas, particularly Diamanus montanus, which efficiently transmit plague. This genus has been implicated in most cases of plague that occurred in the western US in the 20th century.

Another important reservoir host in the US is the prairie dog (Cynomys sp.), which lives in the Rocky Mountains and desert southwest. These rodents are extremely susceptible to plague, with almost all individuals in a colony being killed by an epizootic that was probably initiated by the prairie dogs' common contact with ground squirrels (Stark et al., 1966) Since they are popular pets in the western states, white-tailed prairie dogs are important in spreading plague to children (Stark et al., 1966).

The second important family of campestral reservoir hosts is Cricetidae, the New World mice and rats, voles, and muskrats (Stark et al., 1966). Particularly important species in this family are Onychomys sp., the grasshopper mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, the deer mice, and Microtus sp., the meadow voles. Grasshopper mice are carnivorous, feeding on anything from insects to other mice. They also enter ground squirrel and prairie dog habitations to search for food, and are therefore likely to get bitten by the same fleas (Stark et al. , 1996). Deer mice seem to have evolved immunity to the plague bacterium, and are in close contact with other rodents, so they effectively circulate Y. pestis through shared fleas. Finally, meadow voles have extremely high reproductive potential, and their numbers can actually increase in an epizootic of plague (Stark et al., 1966). They also can come near human habitations, and several species have been responsible for plague outbreaks in Tacoma, Washington, and Mexico City (Stark et al., 1966).

While campestral rodents have been responsible for most recent cases of plague in the US and around the world, the far more important rodents historically are those in urban environments, the Old World commensal rats and mice. These species, responsible for the Black Death, are still the primary reservoir hosts in plague transmission in Asia. Particularly important are two species in the genus Rattus: Rattus rattus, the black or roof rat of India and southeast Asia, and Rattus norvegicus, the brown or Norway rat of Russia and Central Asia. R. rattus is smaller and less aggressive than its cousin, and resides in tropical climates (Stark et al., 1966). It also is a climber, and tends to live in the roofs of buildings and ships. R. norvegicus likes to live close to the ground, and is also not as adaptable, making it easier to expel or exterminate from buildings (Stark et al., 1966). Rats are not capable of maintaining an epizootic cycle on their own, since they die quickly from plague, and their fleas (such as X. cheopis) are usually species-specific. However, if rats interact with campestral rodents, fleas such as N. fasciatus would be able to transfer the infection to rats. A large number of rats and fleas, such as can occur on ships and in densely populated cities, can then maintain the plague cycle for a significant period.

Human Infection with Plague
In most cases, the information detailed above is simply reference material, as the plague bacterium continues to circulate only between fleas and their rodent hosts. However, humans can be infected with Y. pestis in several ways (Scott and Duncan, 2001). The first and most important is cohabitation with rats and their fleas. X. cheopis is rather host-specific, but it does occasionally bite humans, particularly in situations where people regularly come into contact with rats. When rats are infected with plague, they quickly expire from the disease. When the flea senses the carcass getting cold, it will leave its host and seek a new one. The blockage of the proventriculus of X. cheopis makes it even more eager to find a new blood meal. As more rats die, a vicious cycle is created where starved fleas become more cosmopolitan in their host selection, eventually biting a person. A human could also be infected from plague directly from wild reservoir hosts. This is particularly the case with hunters who are bitten by the fleas of a small rodent that they have killed and eaten.

In both cases, there are situations that place people at a higher risk of contracting plague. The most important is when movement into new, untrodden campestral regions brings humans into direct contact with enzootic plague, particularly in situations of war or mass migration (Christie, 1969 in Scott and Duncan, 2001). Also, unsanitary conditions can lead to higher densities of rats, which may feed on detritus and fecal matter or the insects that inhabit them. Finally, in certain cultures, particularly in India, it is sinful to harm rats, so they are often allowed entry or habitation in dwellings, making plague infections much more likely. It is unknown what factors might make a person more susceptible to contracting plague, but it has been found that about 65% of human subjects develop protective antibodies following inoculation with formalin-killed, agar grown suspensions of Y. pestis (Stark et al. , 1966).

Once an infected flea has bitten a person, the individual will be afflicted with symptoms of plague. These include a rapid fever, reaching 105º F within a day, headache, nausea, pain, and restlessness (Stark et al. , 1966). In the bubonic form, inflammation of the lymph nodes (called buboes) occurs. If Y. pestis reaches the bloodstream, it multiplies and releases toxins into the blood, causing the rapidly fatal septicemic plague. The first two cases both result in death in 3-5 days in most people, but neither is contagious, and can only be spread through flea bites (Stark et al., 1966). However, the third form, pneumonic plague, is contagious. This form occurs in about 5% of infections, where the Y. pestis enters the respiratory system, and it can be passed on through inhalation of airborne saliva droplets containing the bacterium (Scott and Duncan, 2001). Contact with salivary secretions from infected rats or other animals can also result in plague infection (Rail, 1985). Those that survive past a week with the disease are generally able to recover, and develop antibodies to the bacterium.

Without treatment, about 30-50% of bubonic plague cases and nearly all septicemic or pneumonic plague cases are fatal (Scott and Duncan, 2001). Treatment of plague is possible if it is detected early. Pharmaceuticals used to treat plague include sulfonamides and the antibiotic streptomycin. However, the Y. pestis might become resistant to streptomycin within 4-5 days of treatment (Stark et al., 1966). Treatment presents its own problems; large doses of drugs may cause sudden destruction of many bacteria, which would then release large amounts of toxin into the bloodstream, hastening death (Stark et al., 1966). Therefore, the best medication for plague is prevention of Y. pestis from infecting a human through parasite control measures.

Preventative and Control Measures
In its 1976 Plague Manual, the World Health Organization offered several suggestions to local governments to control the spread of the disease. The first and primary objective was to control flea populations. Ever since World War II, pesticides such as DDT had been pronounced miracle treatments for parasite extermination. However, this 'miracle' was short-lived. In areas where DDT was used for malaria eradication, which also happened to be areas at high risk for plague epidemics, fleas and most other parasites had developed resistance to the chemical. Therefore, more powerful insecticides had to be formulated. This presented several problems: the first one was the cost of such a measure, which most developing countries could not afford and most western manufacturers would not make cost-effectively. The second was the safety of the local population. Most people in these areas survived on agriculture, and the accidental poisoning of crops with insecticide could have disastrous results. The use of 'bait boxes' presented a more effective option. These boxes would contain foods for rodent consumption, as well as an insecticide dust. When attracted to these boxes, the rodents would get covered with the dust, which would kill the fleas both on their fur and later in their nest (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). There would have to be care taken not to kill the rodents as well, though, because dead rodents often made the likelihood of fleas biting people higher and therefore more dangerous.

The second goal was rodent control. The WHO noted that the most popular reaction to a plague outbreak was the attempted extermination of all rodents in the area. However, this approach presented some major setbacks, including the lack of funding, personnel, and equipment to institute such a large-scale extermination, and the likelihood that the destruction of a limited population of rodents would only lead to faster reproduction among the survivors and a rapid increase in rodent density over the earlier population (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). Instead, it was recommended that improvements in sanitation, proper waste disposal, proper storage of grains and foodstuff, and ratproofing of structures would yield better results in a much more cost-effective manner (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). If rodent extermination was found to be necessary, it had to be preceded by flea elimination, because as stated previously, dead rats and live fleas would only lead to an epidemiological nightmare. Furthermore, since most rodenticides were also toxic to humans and other animals, such fumigation campaigns could only be undertaken in areas away from human habitations. This makes sense, because rats only get attacked by plague-carrying fleas when they enter non-human campestral settings where wild rodent reservoir hosts reside.

The final part of the cycle that could be affected by control measures was the prevention of the spread of pneumonic plague (Bahmanyar and Cavanaugh, 1976). The most important solution was early detection and treatment of bubonic plague, before it could reach its pneumonic form. If the disease became contagious, it would require quarantine of all individuals who were in contact with the infected individual, and in densely populated regions, such as in Africa and Asia, such a process would be extremely difficult. Furthermore, quarantine would have to take place inside the house, since pneumonic plague patients would be unable to travel to a hospital and would put in danger everyone encountered on the way there. Since adequately equipped public health officials would not be available on an individual basis, such an approach would only be effective if only a small number of infected people and households were involved. Even if pneumonic plague in a single village was treated or controlled, the cycle would likely continue in nearby areas. Therefore, even after attempting all available local measures, there would still have to be larger national and international changes in order to truly prevent plague infection, and this would require a high level of social and political cooperation that is difficult to build and maintain.

Social and Political Questions
All epidemiologists agree that the most important preventative and control measure for any disease is international cooperation and peace. In the current climate of tension and conflict, it has been increasingly difficult for international organizations like the WHO or NGOs to obtain the financial and personnel support from the developed powers that is so desperately needed to address epidemics. While all attempts have been made to control the plague outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the huge influx of refugees from Sudan into DRC and neighboring countries puts thousands of people at higher risk for infection in unsanitary campestral conditions. The only effective remedy for this situation is neither scientific nor epidemiological, but political and moral: a declaration of peace by the Sudanese government and the permission of Sudanese refugees to return to their homes in Darfur. In order for this outcome to occur, the WHO and United Nations must take the initiative, enlisting the aid of thus far uncooperative developed powers in return for better relations with other nations.

A final question that can be asked is whether plague is a practical biological weapon, and if so, the best way to prevent its use by hostile actors. In discussing the ecology of Y. pestis, it has been found that the simple introduction of plague bacterium into a city will not immediately cause mass death. The bacterium must first embed itself in the parasitological cycle by infecting a rodent host and getting ingested by a flea. As long as proper sanitary and parasite control measures are maintained, the bacteria would be likely to die out naturally or only survive in campestral foci without debilitating effects on humans. Regardless of this low likelihood of the purposeful use of plague as a weapon, the second question of preventing its use is just as important. The best solution here is ensuring that no actor would ever be justified in having hostile intentions against another state or individual. By maintaining peaceful and open relations with all classes of people throughout the world, the work undertaken by so many epidemiologists over the decades would finally accomplish its goal, the assurance of the world's health and well being.",21.48,37.32,25.69,33.82,35539
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS: ON THE PRESUMED SYMPATRIC SPECIATION OF VIDUA,"Introduction:
Ernst Mayr once wrote, sympatric speciation is like the Lernaean Hydra which grew two new heads whenever one of its old heads was cut off (1963:451). This observation, from his landmark text Animal Species and Evolution, marks the beginning of his systematic confutation of all evidence and theory pertaining to the possibility of sympatric speciation available at that time. Much has changed, however, in the field of biology since '63, but his point still remains valid: since Darwin's original vague descriptions on the requirements for speciation, many have forwarded models involving speciation in sympatry only to have them later disproved - or at least highly questioned - by the academic community (White, 1978; Coyne & Ore, 2004). As of late, a new surge of interest and research has once again made its way into the journals and texts. Recent publication, such as Via (2001), have attempted to review and bolster the newest evidence for speciation in sympatry; do these examples simply represent another head on the immortal hydra or has the tide shifted so much that we can accept the possibility of this type of speciation? Coyne & Orr (2004) doubt much of this new evidence; however, they offer that the likelihood of this mode in specific cases is increasing with each new paper published.

Recently, yet another possible example has been described by science, which may offer some of the most compelling support for sympatric speciation. The system does not rely upon genetic changes to promote assortative mating, but instead offers an example where learned behavior may be crucial to mate selection (Beltman et al. , 2003; Beltman et al. , 2004). What herein follows is a review of this system and its implications; the work, done mostly by University of Michigan resident Robert Payne and Michael Sorenson of Boston University, is upon the many subspecies and sister species of the African indigobirds, Vidua spp. (Sorenson et al. , 2002). Historical geographic and genetic evidence - along with the effects of song learning - all seem to support rapid speciation in this genus, most likely under sympatric conditions.

Specifications of the System and the Implications of Learning:
The brood parasitic indigobirds rely on a novel method to choose their parasitized host: they learn their song. Payne et al. (2004) describes this system in some detail and supports it with cross-foster experiments (Payne et al. , 1998, 2000). The most simplistic description of this host-parasite relationship is as follows: adult females of Vidua lay their eggs in the nests of several other finch species in West and Central Africa. They choose which species to parasitize based upon the male calls of that species: the call of their host father. Their young, subsequently, imprint upon the host species' song: females learn to respond to it and males learn to produce it. The females, then, choose their conspecfic mates based on the song of their heterospecific host parents. The cycle then repeats, when these now pregnant females choose where to lay their eggs based on the learned calls (Payne et al. , 2004). To date, this type of behavior has been observed in the indigobirds of Vidua, with most having specific hosts in Estrildidae (Sorenson et al. , 2004). Importantly, the observed morphological differences amongst indigobirds of Vidua appears to be a recent adaptation that helps their orphaned young better exploit their specific host species; mouth markings differ significantly, resembling those of the offspring of the parasitized host (Sorenson et al. , 2003). To counter act these markings some host species have gotten better and better at determining which mouths belong to their own species. However, Payne et al. (2001) suggest that this mechanism is not very efficient, and depends on many variables - such the number and type of young present and in the nest (type meaning heterospecific, conspecific, or mixed nest mates).

Support for this song learning behavior is twofold: first, [1] cross foster experiments with non-traditional hosts supports the imprinting practice (Payne et al. , 1998, 2000); secondly, [2] in some described host-parasite complexes, their appears to be recent parasite switches, where the same species in sympatry have created two mutually exclusive breading pools by singing the songs of different host species - this would be the beginning of a speciation event (Payne et al. , 2002, 2005). These sympatric populations show little morphological differences, suggesting that these changes occur after the colonization of a new host species.

Payne et al. conducted their first cross foster experiment in 1998, where they showed that male finches will learn the calls of their typical1 host, the red-billed firefinch (Lagonosticta senegala ), or a stand-in non-normal host parent, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata). They conducted a second experiment in 2000 to test the extent of female imprinting and further strengthen previous observations for the 1998 study. Their experiment was designed principally to test three hypotheses: an H0 of no preferential selection of host-nest by female indigobirds; an Ha1 of innate selection of normal parasitized hosts; and an Ha2 of a learned preferential selection of host-nest by females. Payne and his colleges performed the experiment with Vidua chalybeata, the village indigobird; again, it's normal host, the red-billed firefinch, and the experimental foster species, the Bengalese, finch were used.

In the cross-foster experiments captive-reared indigobirds were raised by either the Bengalese finch or the red-billed finch, as adults they were tested for preferences in mate and nest choice. In the support of their Ha2, Payne et al. (2000) find that captive females raised by Bengalese finches both respond to males who sing the Bengalese song and choose to parasitize the nests of the Bengalese finch, over those of their normal host. Implicit here is also the finding that male indigos raised by Bengalese parents produce the calls of their heterospecific parents (Payne et al. , 1998). Additionally, the captives raised by the normal host species respond in predictable manners: choosing to mate with indigos who produced a red-billed finch song and exploiting the nests of these heterospecifics. Furthermore, the experimenters found that later exposure to non-parental type songs had no effect on mate choice or nest chosen for brood parasitism; suggesting a critical period for song acquisition and imprinting sometime before fledging - this finding is also consistent with Payne et al. (1998).

When compared with other brood parasitizing bird species, these results are unique to the Vidua. Cowbirds, for example, are host generalists; both genetic and behavioral evidence suggest no pattern of consistent host selection (Payne et al. , 2000). Also, while there is some evidence of host specific preferences by females in the brood parasitic Cuckoo species (Cuculus spp.), male behaviors facilitate large quantities of gene flow between the female 'types', preventing the evolution of host-specific species. Male Cuckoos2 will mate with different females with different host preferences - meaning that any possibility of speciation is hindered by the male lineages (Payne et al. , 2000).

Given that indigobirds can learn the call of a new host species in captivity, Payne et al. (2002, 2005) suggest that recent demographic changes may have forced a host switch in at least two separate Vidua species (V. chalybeata (2002) and V. camerunensis (2005)) - implying that this experimental data is supported by observational studies. The repercussions of these switches will be explored later; however, it is important to note here that both captive and wild indigobirds can and do occasionally learn songs of a novel host.

The observation that host switching does occur in the indigobird species is the first step in showing that sympatric speciation is possible under the correct ecological conditions. Beltman et al. (2003, 2004) explore some of the general theoretical consequences that learning can have on a speciation event. Arguments against the creation of new species under sympatry often question the amount of gene flow that could occur between two recently divergent populations and the ability for a new colonizing type to find conspecific mates (White, 1978; Coyne & Orr, 2004). Beltman et al. (2004) show rather convincingly, however, that the novel nature of this host-parasite interaction where both the male and the female mutants will assortatively mate can facilitate speciation via a cultural trait. They suggest that, since indigobirds have low error rates in egg laying (≤1%) and the tendency to mate only within your cultural group is so great - both males and females have mechanisms of imprinting - initial assortative mating based only on learned traits could eventually lead to genetically isolated species. Furthermore, the observed mechanisms used by the host species to counter act the parasitism, may force genetic changes that will later make possible a genetically based form of isolation (Beltman et al. 2004).

However, they caution that the balance between low error rates and finding a conspecific mate create many difficulties; when colonization does occur the cost of finding a mate that knows the same song as you may be too high to make the colonization viable. Therefore, they assume that many colonization events probably occurred - only to fail many times - in the indigobird species before being successful (Beltman et al. , 2004). Conclusively showing that the observed diversification in indigos is due only to a learned song was beyond the scope of their paper; however, this theoretical work only supports the genetic evidence.

Evidence for Divergence in Sympatry:
Theoretical, verbal, and mathematical models can only go so far - descriptive and exhaustive field research is essential in showing what is actually happening. To this end, Sorenson and Payne have devoted a large portion of their fieldwork to genetics (Sorenson & Payne, 2001, 2002; Sorenson et al. 2003, 2004). Their research efforts have focused on the creation of an accurate phylogeny based upon genetic data - obvious arguments against this methodology and its application have been raised by many (see Coyne & Orr, 2004); however, their conclusions seem valid (Sorenson et al. 2003; Sefc et al. 2005). In any case, the many academic problems raised by this method will be discussed later. To best establish the evidence for sympatric divergence we will explore the work done by Payne, Sorenson, and their colleagues in the context of the eight criteria set down by Coyne & Orr (please see appendix, table 1). Thus, the following discussion will mirror the structure of Coyne & Orr, thereby, substantiating the presumed sympatric speciation of the indigobirds.

The first criterion is simply met by these birds: their ranges do overlap largely and nearly completely - though the birds have been described in two geographic distributions: the West African indigos (seven species) and the Southern African indigos (four species, V. chalybeata is present in both populations). Comprehensive field descriptions of the species distributions have been done by Payne. Of interest is Payne's 1982 publication; in this particular case, Payne described, among other things, the ranges of five species of Vidua 3 and their hosts' ranges4. All species were found to be sympatric in the range studied5.

In addition, this data set supports the second tenet of Coyne & Orr: it shows that these species do parasitize specific hosts - though, occasionally, they do make mistakes (Sefc et al. , 2005; Payne & Sorenson, 2004). Sorenson et al. (2004) clearly establishes the host-parasite relationship in a phylogenic reconstruction (see appendix figure 2); this data suggests that some Vidua parasitize multiple hosts occasionally (dotted lines), while others are very host-specific. In addition, this data illustrates the complexity of the speciation events occurring: the Vidua do not simply mirror the speciation events of their hosts - they radiated much later6. This is unlike many host-parasite speciation relationships, where a geographic separation of host populations caused a speciation event in both the host and parasite populations.

The third tenet, and perhaps one of the most challenging to meet, states that the parasites must be sister taxa - implying the necessity of clear phylogenic relationships. Coyne & Orr caution that a genetically based phylogeny may show inaccurate relationships and divergence rates - since interspecific hybridization probably occurs, tainting the gene pool. Exhaustive phylogenetic work, however, (mostly mtDNA) supports a sister taxa relationship (Sorenson et al. , 2002, 2004; Sorenson & Payne, 2001, 2002). The data of Sorenson et al. (2002) presents the clearest image of these relationships; summarized in figure 3 of the appendix, are is this phylogeny of both Viduidae and Estrildidae. While this work is genetic in nature, theoretically mathematical models (see Sefc et al. , 2005) on these particular relationships demonstrate its validity. Sefc et al. argues that, though the hybridization does occur, it is not often enough to significantly skew the data sets. In addition, this study established that the indigobirds meet the fourth criterion: reproductive isolation. Sefc et al. shows that the species are distinct and genetically isolated; importantly, however, this is not genetically based isolation - it is learned. Further direct observational data of hybridization can be found in Payne & Sorenson (2004); here the authors observed hybridization between V. paradisaea and V. chalybeata - this hybridization was established by genetic tests (mtDNA). Thus far, the Vidua seem to conform to the first four tenets of Coyne & Orr.

Clearly, the fifth criterion of Coyne & Orr has already been well established: assortative mating does occur. Undeniably, Payne and Sorenson have shown countless times that the indigos preferentially choose conspecifics based on a learned call. This evidence has already been presented earlier, thus, will not be repeated. Allowing us then, to focus on the six and seventh criteria; it is best to take these two in tandem, since they represent very similar principles. First, as explained above the indigobird's young have developed specific mouth markings to deceive host parents; these markings represent both a genetic adaptation to a specific host and a means by which fitness is increased with the normative host (Payne et al. , 2001). Essentially, this evidence is used to forward a true species distinction in the face of introgression, and demonstrates that each species has adapted to their respective host. Coyne & Orr argue that a species definition based solely on a cultural trait, may be meaningless (2004:221-222). However, since these markings establish differences outside of simple maternal mitochondrial lineages, it is safe to conclude a true species distinction.

Outside of the descriptive studies, which demonstrate these differences (Payne, 1982), Payne et al. (2001) has done cross-foster experiments indicating a fitness advantage to the normative host based on the mouth markings. Their study focused mainly upon V. chalybeata, and interestingly showed that, while fitness advantages are present they are not great enough to prevent colonization of new hosts. This suggests that the indigobirds exist in a very narrow adaptive peak, where colonization advantages are only partially restrained by host specificity. Once a new niche is realized, it is best to evolve host-distinct features, when the peculiarity conveys fitness advantages.

Finally then, we are left with the eighth, and last tenet, of Coyne & Orr: the biogeographic and evolutionary history of the taxa makes an allopatric phase very unlikely  (emphasis theirs, 158). While conforming to this criterion is difficult, both direct and indirect evidence seem to imply no allopatric phase (Payne, 1982; Payne et al. , 2002, 2005). Direct evidence comes from the geography of Africa; currently, the populations are sympatric and there seems to be no geographic barrier - past or present - to gene flow (Payne, 1982). Additionally, and more interestingly, there appears to observable sympatric speciation currently occurring in some Vidua populations; this evidence indirectly supports past sympatric speciation - since it supports the hypothetical possibility of this speciation mode (Payne et al. , 2002, 2005).

In their work done in 2002, Payne and his colleagues describe a system apparently limited to a population of indigos living on the Zambezi River. The populations consists of V. chalybeata, its normal host, L. senegala, and a novel host, L. nitidula. Genetic evidence suggests a recent switch of V. chalybeata from L. senegala to L. nitidula; this switch occurred in sympatry. Importantly, morphological features seem to have lagged behind this behavioral switch - aside from song no diagnostic technique can distinguish the two 'cultural morphs'. More interesting still are the kinship implications derived from mtDNA microsatellite analysis. There is a high incidences of relatedness between the L. nitidula parasites; specifically, the genes suggest that the host switch occurred four specific times, representing four matrilines. Essentially, it appears that the first steps toward speciation have occurred - in fact the L. nitidula morph was even once mistakenly describe as a new species (V. incognita by Nicolai (1972)). Payne et al. (2002) does not speculate on why the switch occurred; however, in a similar system described with V. camerunensis environmental changes by humans may account for the host switch - they cite the concurrent introduction of wheat to the region (circa 0 A.D.)(Payne et al. , 2005).

Conclusion:
With the advancement of genetic technology, a vast quantity of data is being generated in the field of evolutionary biology. This new information has been applied by many to determine the nature of the biological systems observed, and has generated a resurgence of interest in sympatric speciation (Via, 2004). It remains unclear, however, if this new data will decisively end this debate; nonetheless, it has visibly altered the way we think about speciation. Apparently, Payne, Sorenson, and their colleagues, have described a system that has the general trappings of sympatric speciation; it meets all the criteria set down by Coyne & Orr and, also, relies upon a novel system to promote assortative mating: song learning. With further evidence and advancements in methodology, we may soon be able to demonstrate a more complex model for this speciation event, further supporting a hypothesis of sympatric speciation. As of now, it appears that 'cultural' traits can, in this instance, serve as the initial step towards speciation. Concerning this particular case, Coyne & Orr have written this constitutes one of the few plausible cases of sympatric speciation (222); and, given their usual staunch skepticism toward sympatric speciation, this is a clear stamp of approval. Hopefully, further systems will support these conclusions.

Biology,Report,Undergraduate,SENSORY DRIVE AND SPECIATION,"Do ecological constraints favour certain perceptual systems and, thus, generate species-specific modes of mate signalling; or, do these modes and traits vary arbitrarily? Boughman (2002) proposes that - while Fisher's runaway model accurately predicts the exaggeration of males signalling traits - a more holistic model based on the exact nature of the environment and the physiology of the organism, and its perceptual systems, better explains interspecific differences. Specifically, Boughman suggests clinal-like differences in habitat, or microhabitat, can promote sensory system differences, which then shape signalling modalities. This model - called the sensory drive hypothesis - does not necessarily contest Fisher's model, and may work in conjunction with it and other models to promote the variation of mating-specific traits.

The sensory drive hypothesis predicts that signalling systems will be shaped by three specific environment-organism interactions. Given the general nature of intersexual pressures, for our discussion the receiver of a signal will be taken as the female of the species, while the signaller as the male. Boughman briefly describes the three interactions and defines them as: [1] habitat transmission, [2] perceptual tuning, and [3] signal matching. Taken in turn, each of these properties shape the signalling system of the organism and interact to generate a specific signalling system. First, habitat transmission describes what signal best passes through the environment. Theoretically, the best call would travel relatively intact through the environment; preservation - in light of the degradation caused by the abiotic properties of the habitat - is favoured. Secondly, perceptual tuning describes the exploitation of female adaptations specific to non-mate-finding tasks by males: such as finding food and/or detecting predators. For example, Smith et al. (2004) suggest that the female preference for red coloured jaws and throats in male three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) evolved in response to foraging preferences; in essence, male sticklebacks exploit females' preferences for red colouring. Finally, the third tenant of Boughman model - signal matching - implies that males should produce calls that females can easily detected given the physiological nature of their sensory systems. Unsurprisingly, producing a call that is within the female's range of greatest sensitivity is beneficial both to the males (wasting unheard calls) and to the females (reducing search costs for potential mates).

Under allopatry, then, is easy to see how these signalling constraints could changes in response to habitat and cause divergence. Boughman describes several examples of such changes in habitat producing divergent sensory adaptations - such as the colour sensitivity in fish. She observes that several inland varieties of snapper (Lutjanidae family) have spectral shifts towards green - enhancing their perception in the yellow-green waters of their habitat - while their reef dwelling cousins have spectral shifts towards blue, best for their less turbid waters. It then follows that if colouration were important for mate choice in this family, sexual selection would produce male colourings best for the snapper's environment and most easily matched to females' sensory ranges. Such a system could drive divergence of shore populations and reef populations in both female preference and male signalling modes.

Consequentially, Boughman suggests these changing systems could then promote speciation via assortative mating. She verbally describes a modal where, under allopatry, sensory drive produces enough changes in the two populations to prevent heterospecific mate recognition should sympatry reoccur. These changes could both strengthen other reproductive barriers and/or act as the primary barrier to heterospecific mating. In addition, she observes that species-specific microhabitat assortment during mating would also enforce species boundaries. This microhabitat assortment could be a by-product of sensory system changes, usually related to niche specific adaptations or constraints, or related to predatory pressures.

As always, Boughman recognizes that a host of apomorphic traits might work together to promote assortative mating and that specific studies are necessary to observe the causality of a speciation event presumed to be a product of sensory drive. Furthermore, she recognizes that ecologically similar species are unlikely to coexist, even when some sexual isolation exists (574). That is to say that under sympatry, if the changes are not large enough to prevent hybridization then stabilizing selection might push the species together again. Conversely, if the species are sexual isolated, but occupying the same niche, then one species may go extinct if they do not evolve towards different environments first. It seems that, while sensory drive is pivotal to certain speciation events, it often works in conjunction with other isolating mechanisms to produce species. Boughman's model helps refocus the researcher's eye on the ecological that produces and physiology of an organisms sensory system. Future studies can, therefore, be illuminated by this model and take into account the effect of the habitat on the signalling modality.

Biology,Report,Undergraduate,PLANT POLLINATION SYSTEMS: EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN GENERALIZATION AND SPECIALIZATION,"Perhaps one of the most intriguing varieties of mutualism is the relationship between angiosperms and their pollinators. The evolutionary forces at work in these systems continue to both intrigue and perplex botanists and evolutionary biologists. In a relatively recent paper, Johnson & Steiner (2000) explore the common theories, misconceptions, and research methodologies that are used in the study of plant-pollinator relationships. They challenge some long held ideas about the nature of specialization and generalization of floral complexes, and suggest that the cause of these trends may be more complex than current thinking predicates. In addition, they explore the implications of ecosystem alterations and the threat of extinction on the more specialized mutualists.

Theoretically, specialization and generalization of plants to pollinators offers some mutually exclusive advantages. These advantages stem form the observation of Stebbin that specialization is best when the most effective pollinator's availability is reliable, whereas generalization should be favored when pollinator availability is irregular. From this theoretical framework many hypotheses have been forwarded and tested concerning these systems. In their review Johnson & Steiner reconsider some of the theories. For example, plants which cover a large range should favor specialization for particularly specific insects who are themselves specialized to the plants - because excess pollen for a variety of other plant species might clog-up their reproductive bits. In addition to this observation, Johnson & Steiner explore a host of other ideas about these systems, such as: the impact of plant life-histories, colonization practices, and breeding systems on the tendency to generalize or specialize.

From this theoretical base the authors then explore and intriguing cause of convergence present in the plant world - which they refer to as pollination syndromes. These syndromes, it is argued, are driven by similar needs for similar pollinator types. For example, large pollinators - such as butterflies - may prefer larger flowers with specific colors, whereas smaller pollinators may favor smaller flowers with alternative colorings. One well studied instance of this type of favoring has been documented in the Mumulus (monkeyflower). It is thought that the preferential dispositions of these animals drives convergence in unrelated genera of plants. Therefore, the penchant of evening or night pollination by moths, would drive plants to have syndromes that make pollination more easy for these pollinators. The authors question, however, the simplistic causal relationship within theses systems. They argue that some theoretical evidence denies, for example, some common notions about these systems: such as, the importance of flower coloring as a mode of specialization. This is important from an evolutionary biologists standpoint because often these syndromes are seen as an isolating mechanism in sympatry. However, since the casual relationship is often unclear, the authors argue prudence when exploring speciation events based on these traits. Furthermore, they argue that geographic trends might also play a large role in the specialization or generalization of plants. Since ecosystems are notably different in northern and southern climates, they authors argue that other abiotic factors maybe driving the trends of specialization and generalization.

Finally, then, the authors explore the implications of the budding quantity of evidence on efforts for conservation. They observe that the lifespan of plants versus pollinators, may give false impressions about the intrinsic link between pollinators and their plants; since some plants may survive long after their specific pollinator is gone, we may witness a delayed extinction in these species. It seems that as the study of these amazing systems grows, so will are our understanding of evolutionary convergence and speciation, and our best means of species protection and management.",0,0,0,0,4042
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,"CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS, RECOMBINATION SUPPRESSION, AND SPECIATION: A REVIEW OF RIESEBERG (2001)","The causal link between chromosomal rearrangements and speciation events is still considered by many to be unclear. Whether new arrangements arise after speciation to reinforce species' boundaries or, instead, serve as the primary isolation mechanism in speciation, is some what of an enigma to evolutionary biologists. Furthermore, the exact mechanism, by which these two outcomes arise, remains uncertain. Shedding new light on this quandary, Rieseberg (2001) offers a new theoretical mechanism by which these changes might facilitate speciation and/or provide a barrier to gene flow after a speciation event. Her contention arises from the observation that chromosomal rearrangements affecting specific loci may in fact inhibit recombination, thereby, extending there range of influence within the genome. While her theoretical mechanism is still largely untested, its ability to strengthen some current models - which otherwise seem less parsimonious, by relying too heavily on reduced heterospecific fitness - seems a compelling reason to further explore the theory.

Many traditional models of chromosomal speciation depend greatly upon the existence of small isolated populations, where drift can play a major role in determining the fixation of a new rearrangement. Furthermore, these models assume that these underdominant mutations impair hybrid fertility and/or viability, thus, generating species boundaries. These models often implore drift alone to engender fixation of mutations in very small populations, rendering them unlikely forces in speciation. None the less, many of the models presented do offer observational evidence to support their particular mechanisms. Rieseberg's main critic against these models, though, is that reduced gene flow between population appears to strongly enforce species boundaries and that reduced gene flow can be produced without the total hybrid sterility or inviability inherent in these models.

The importance of this observation becomes more evident when one examines the differential effects of chromosomal rearrangements across organism types. To date, it has been shown that these types of mutations more strongly affect plant hybrid fertility/viability than animal hybrids. This conclusion stems from two complimentary lines of reasoning: [1] Sterility in plants is more likely because the male gamete often expresses more of its genome; meaning that, if a chromosomal abnormality is present in the pollen the plant gamete itself has a higher tendency to abort. This does not occur in animal sperm. Secondly [2], the XY type sex determination in animals has led to a very genetically sparse Y-type chromosome. The degenerate Y-chromosome facilities genetic, but not chromosomal, hybrid sterility. Even in plant populations, which use this system for sex determination, the degradation of the Y-chromosome is less apparent. The observation that sterility/inviability of plant hybrids is more often chromosomal, whereas sterility/inviability of animal hybrids is more often genetic constrains the current models, which depend so much upon this reduced hybrid fitness.

From these considerations, Reiseberg offers a more simplistic model to reduce gene flow after a chromosomal rearrangement, than heterospecific fitness. She observes that these rearrangements can strongly effect recombination without rendering the offspring infertile. If the rearrangement is within or linked to an isolating locus of the genome, then reduced gene flow will occur as a result of a lack of recombination. Chromosomal rearrangements can function in this way even when they do not affect hybrid fitness. This theory, however, is still limited because reduced gene flow itself may not cause speciation; furthermore, it is only with an accumulation of many neutral or weakly underdominant rearrangements, linked to isolation loci, that a larger portion of the genome can be affected. One limitation of this model, however, is that is does not help determine whether the arrangement occurred before or after speciation. However, unlike many of the present models, it does allow for speciation in sympatry or parapatry, as well as, reinforcement of allopatrically derived species - which have come together in secondary contact. Reiseberg's new theoretical mechanism proves to be both interesting and plausible. Given further empirical data, it may serve as the new standard model of chromosomal speciation.

Biology,Report,Undergraduate,ON THE ORIGINS OF MAN: UNDERSTANDING THE LAST TWO MILLION YEARS,"INTRODUCTION:
In the past two decades, our understanding of the human genome has increased at remarkable rate. This expansion of our genetic knowledge promised to resolve longstanding questions regarding the origins and evolution of mankind (Eller, 2002). However, after nearly fifteen years of research, our understanding remains limited; genes have raised far more questions then they have answered. Two models, proposed nearly thirty years ago, still hold weight in the anthropological community: the Multiregional and the Replacement model of the evolution of mankind (Eller, 2002). A critical review of various studies concerning the two models and, specifically, of recent genetic evidence concerning the interaction of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis (Caramelli et al., 2003; Gibbons, 2001; Kahn & Gibbons, 1997; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000), will reveal that - while both models are far too simplistic - a pattern closer to Replacement is more likely.

DEFINING THE TWO MODELS:
The Multiregional model of evolution, in its most basic from, argues that the since the original spread of H. erectus out of Africa, approximately 1.7-mya (million years ago), the 'human' population has been one large interbreeding mass (Eller, 2002). This population slowly evolved into what we consider modern humans with no side branching or distinct speciation events occurring in Eurasia, Australasia, or Africa (Eller, 2002; Templeton, 2002). Naturally, the model dictates that the morphological differences and geographical distances between all populations of humans were not enough to genetically isolate them and, thus, the modern human form evolved simultaneously across the entire old-world (Templeton, 2002). Milford Wolpoff, of the University of Michigan, originally proposed this model based solely upon archeological and morphological evidence (Lahr, 1994). Since the models incarnation, however, researchers have forwarded limited genetic evidence and some new morphological evidence to support the model (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001; Templeton, 2002). Furthermore, research, done by Vinayak Eswaran, into population dynamics may also support a multiregional-like model - though Eswaran's model is more complex then Wolpoff's (Eswaran, 2002).

Figure here
Contrary to Multiregionalism is the Replacement model. This model dictates that after H. erectus' initial expansion into the new world, a new form of hominids evolved in Africa, H. sapiens (sometimes written: H. sapiens sapiens) (Treisman, 1995). This new species - after migrating into Eurasia and Australasia approximately 100-kya (thousand years ago) - replaced H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis without inbreeding or hybridization (Eller, 2002). In this model, H. neanderthalensis evolved outside of Africa. The evidence from the Replacement model comes mostly from genetic analysis of modern human lineages and limited fossil evidence (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Jorde et al., 2000). Recently, genetic evidence from H. neanderthalensis and Cro-Magnon man (ancient presumed H. sapiens from around 25-kya) further supports the Replacement model (Caramelli et al., 2003; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000).

These two models are graphically represented in Figure 1, where the single line from Africa in the rightmost image represents H. Sapiens.

Fig 1: Multiregional vs. Replacement Model (Eller, 2002)

Figure here
ARCHEOLOGICAL MULTIREGIONALISM:
The thrust of the evidence for the Multiregional model comes from comparisons of morphological differences between all known fossils of the last 2 million years and separate comparisons of their archeologically represented cultural traits - that is tool use and burial behaviors (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). John Hawks and Wolpoff believe that the morphological differences between the presumed species are insignificant variations - perhaps due to local climatic adaptation - and have not isolated the groups genetically (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). In fact, they content that these morphological differences are not large enough to advance a species difference between any hominid fossil since the emergence H. erectus (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). A review of one recent research endeavor concerning H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens will show that the conclusions about morphological differences are not well founded, thereby, discrediting some claims held by the multiregionalists (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer, Crummett, & Wolpoff, 2001).

A recent study, done by Andrew Kramer, claims to support Wolpoff's contention that H. neanderthalensis does not form a separate species. The study analyzes differences in cranial features between presumed H. neanderthalensis and anatomically modern humans (H. Sapiens), both found in the Levant region (Kramer et al., 2001). This region is thought to be the central hub of migrations between Eurasia and Africa (Walter et al., 2000). Using pairwise analysis differences of six fossils presumed to be anatomically modern humans (Skhul IV, V, & IX and Qafzeh III, VI, IX) and two fossils presumed to be Neandertals (Tabun and Amud) - all from Levant - Kramer concludes that morphological differences are not great enough to make the Neandertals a separate species in this region. In addition, they include thirteen other skulls from around the same time, but from different locations throughout Eurasia. These skulls are composed of six presumed Neandertals, six presumed modern humans, and one non-human primate (KNM-ER 3733) - as an out-group - and are employed to test their methodology. Finally, they analyze twelve character traits using various subsets of these seventeen skulls with the program PAUP* 4.0 and create various phylogenies. (Kramer et al., 2001)

From their analysis of just the Levant fossils and the out-group fossil, they do not find a separate clade for the Neandertals and other Hominids of Levant (Kramer et al., 2001). However, an analysis of just the non-Levant male Neandertals, the non-Levant male modern humans, and the out-group reveals a separate clade for the Neandertals; this abnormality is brushed off as outside the aim of the research and, thus, insignificant. Furthermore, and more curious, the researchers never present or discus a PAUP* 4.0 analysis of all seventeen fossils, again their reasoning being that they are only concerned with the Levantine relationships. They then conclude that inbreeding was present at Levant and, therefore, possible throughout the old-world, thereby, supporting a multiregional inbreeding model. This conclusion is not easily reconciled with the data, which suggests that, even if only in Europe, two separate clades of Neandertals and modern humans existed (Kramer et al., 2001). Therefore, their research scarcely supports the multiregional hypothesis and may even support Replacement.

Furthermore, Mark Collard's research, in the use of pairwise difference analysis for morphological cranial features, suggests that the theoretical assumptions made by Kramer in the aforementioned study may be suspect (Collard & Franchino, 2002). Specifically, Collard proposes that the pairwise analysis - popular for DNA research - is not reliable for cranial morphology analysis. Specifically, Collard attempts to reconstruct the phylogenies of various extant primates groups (Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Hylobates) using craniodental and soft tissue features, many similar to the features used by Kramer (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer et al., 2001). These groups have known phylogenies based on molecular data and other non-facial morphological differences (Boyd & Silk, 2003; Collard & Franchino, 2002). Collard attempts to make phylogenies based on: [1] 96 qualitative craniodental features, [2] 171 soft tissue characters (qualitative), and [3] 129 quantitative craniodental characters, all from two sets of 182 and 100 individuals (combination of all species) with at least 20 individuals from each species in the sets. This is a considerably larger data set then the one used by Kramer (Collard & Franchino, 2002; Kramer et al., 2001). None of the generated phylogenies agree with the known phylogenies of the extant primates (Collard & Franchino, 2002). However, Collard does not use PAUP* 4.0 for is analysis but a different program to create his trees. Thus, Collard's research may not completely invalidate the use of facial features, but it certainly cast doubt on the practical use of them.

Further evidence also casts doubt on the archeological basis for Multiregionalism (Lahr, 1994; Walter et al., 2000); however, there is still much debate on the conclusions presented above (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). In the next section, the genetic evidence presented will generally support these conclusions, which invalidate traditional Multiregionalism. However, the evidence will also suggest that a complete replacement is unlikely. Instead, a complex system with more aspects of Replacement, but some aspects Multiregionalism, is necessary.

GENETIC REPLACEMENT:
In contrast to Multiregionalism, the Replacement model relies heavily upon genetic evidence, owing its existence to a flawed mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) analysis in 1987 (Templeton, 2002). Despite the models beginnings, much more evidence has arisen to support the theory (Jorde et al., 2000; Kimmel, 1999; Quintana-Murci et al., 1999; Templeton, 2002; Thomson, Pritchard, Shen, Oefner, & Feldman, 2000; Underhill et al., 2000). The DNA evidence falls fundamentally in two categories: [1] comparisons of modern human diversity and [2] comparisons of ancient DNA Neandertals and Cro-Magnon man to modern humans (Jorde et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997). For the time being, we will only concern ourselves with the modern human diversity argument, leaving the Neandertal evidence for later discussion.

The modern human diversity argument proposes that given the genetic diversity of modern man, a large bottleneck likely occurred sometime in the last 100,000 years (Eller, 2002). This bottleneck presumably represents a small population of H. Sapiens, who evolved in Africa, replacing all other living hominid species (Eller, 2002; Kimmel, 1999). In many ways, the date of this bottleneck epitomizes the arguments between the two models: both agree that man arose in Africa, but disagree on the date of his diaspora and the effects of his diaspora on population dynamics (Wall, 2000). The theoretical reasoning behind the detection of the bottleneck lies in a mathematical function known as a Laplace transformation (Kimmel, 1999). While the actual workings of this function are unimportant, Marek Kimmel has observed that - despite the instability inherent in the equation - simulation studies have proven that it can effectively predict population size changes and, thus, be applied to detect signs of a population bottleneck.

Researchers have used several classes of DNA evidence (Y-Chromosome DNA, mtDNA and Autosomal DNA) to investigate the possibility of a bottleneck and, subsequently, have attempted to date any observed bottleneck event(s) (Jorde et al., 2000). All attempts at dating, however, have utilized the same theoretical assumption: They have all relied upon a stable mutation rate of their respective DNA, assuming selective neutrality of their DNA regions (Thomson et al., 2000). Thus, the researchers are able to predict a date of divergence by effectively counting the number of mutations in the present population and comparing them to the molecular clock of mutation rates. To set their clocks, the researchers must use DNA from the last known ancestor of the human, the chimpanzee, which diverged from modern man approximately 5 million years ago (Thomson et al., 2000). Again, by comparing the overall differences between chimpanzee and human DNA they are able to establish a rate of mutation for whatever region they are studying; of course, this inherently assumes that the divergence date from Pan troglodytes is correct, this date being based on fossil evidence (Boyd & Silk, 2003).

Two recent studies using these methods have employed Y-chromosome DNA, and offer nearly identical dates if divergence (Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000), however they do not prove the Replacement model since so much theory is still in question (Hammer et al., 1998; Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001; Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000; Wall, 2000).

The first researcher, Peter Underhill, analyzes 167 polymorphisms on a portion of NRY DNA (non-recombinant y-chromosome DNA) from 1062 individuals (Underhill et al., 2000). Underhill attempts to accurately represents the genetic diversity of the human population by choosing an ethnically diverse group - a rather common practice in studies of this nature (Jorde et al., 2000; Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000). Underhill found that the largest amount of genetic diversity occurs in Africa and detected a bottleneck event approximately 59-kya. This estimate assumes 6,900 years between new mutations, with an average of 8.6 mutations in any population. Underhill accounts for the many sources of error with an upper and lower limit of 35-kya and 89-kya. This estimate is much more recent than the original 100-kya (Eller, 2002; Underhill et al., 2000).

The second researcher, Russell Thomson, analyzes three genes found on the Y-chromosome (SMCY, DBY & DFFRY) (Thomson et al., 2000). Combined the genes represent 64,120bp, show 56 unique (non-repeating) polymorphisms, and have an average calculated mutation rate of 1.24e-9bp per year. Extrapolating a phylogeny from this data set using GENETREE, Thomson found a bottleneck event approximately 50-kya, with the most diverse population being African. This all suggests a modern African origin, with an expansion around 50-kya.

However, while both of these studies seem to support the Replacement model, there is still a considerable amount of further research needed. Both Underhill and Thomson have stated that the lack of genetic diversity on the Y-chromosome may be a result of selection pressure (Thomson et al., 2000; Underhill et al., 2000) and, therefore, invalidating their mutation rate estimates. Furthermore, Thomson recognizes that these date-estimates do not agree with other genetic evidence, such as the β-globin loci, which place the bottleneck at a much earlier date more in agreement with the Multiregional model (Templeton, 2002; Thomson et al., 2000). Conversely, Thomson and Underhill's estimates agree with other genetic evidence such as mtDNA and Autosomal DNA (Jorde et al., 2000). All this conflicting evidence remains to be thoroughly reconciled. However, the large body of genetic evidence seems to support to a pattern akin to the Replacement model.

NEW NEANDERTAL DNA :
Some of the problems associated with the genetic examination of human history lie in its inability to examine DNA from the extinct hominids (Hawks & Wolpoff, 2001). However, with new techniques, pioneered by Svante Paabo, this type of analysis has become possible (Krings et al., 1997). In the last six years, scientists have been able to reconstruct two partial genomes of H. neanderthalensis (Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Analysis of these genomes has suggested to some that the Neandertal did not contribute to the modern day gene pool (Caramelli et al., 2003; Gibbons, 2001; Kahn & Gibbons, 1997; Krings et al., 2000; Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000) and, thus, was an evolutionary dead-end. This would mean that modern humans replaced the Neandertal in Eurasia and Australasia.

Matthias Krings was the first to successfully study Neandertal DNA in 1997 (Krings et al., 1997). His analysis was of mtDNA of a Neandertal found in Feldhofer, Germany, which dated less then 100-ky old. For this study and all subsequent studies since mtDNA is used because, on average, per cell there are a significant number of copies of mtDNA, as opposed to the one nuclear copy of DNA (Krings et al., 1997; Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Krings duplicated fragments of the mtDNA using PCR and obtained a 379bp fragment. The amplification process on ancient DNA (aDNA) has yet to be proven entirely reliable, but recent studies suggest that with the proper precautions a reliable sample can be obtained (Gilbert et al., 2003). Krings then proceeded to compare the sequence with that of modern humans and chimpanzees. He obtained an average difference of 8.0 ± 3.0 substitutions for a human-human comparison, 25.6 ± 2.2 substitutions for the human-Neandertal comparison, and 55.0 ± 3.0 for a human-chimpanzee relationship; this data is summarized in Figure 2. In addition, Krings found that the mtDNA of the Neandertal was no more closely related to the mtDNA of any regional group of modern humans and, thus, in disagreement with the Multiregional Model. This model predicts that European Neandertals should be closest in relation to modern Europeans, reflecting the assimilation of the Neandertal DNA by hybridization into local populations. Furthermore, he was able to reconstruct a phylogeny of humans, Neandertals, and chimps predicting a human-Neandertal split approximately 550-kya to 690-kya. He is careful to note that this phylogeny only compares one partial Neandertal mtDNA genome and, therefore, should be interpreted cautiously. (Krings et al., 1997)

Fig 2: Net Substitution Differences (Krings et al., 1997)

Figure here
In 2000, Igor Ovchinnikov studied a second mtDNA sequence from a Neandertal, who dated at ~29-ky old (Ovchinnikov et al., 2000). Archeologists unearthed the Neandertal in the Mezmaiskaya cave in northern Caucasus - 2,500km from the Germen location, Feldhofer. Using the same precautions and general techniques of Krings, Ovchinnikov was able to extract a 345bp segment of mtDNA. Comparisons of this strand to the Feldhofer strand, modern humans, and chimpanzees revealed a parsimoniously phylogeny (with the lowest bootstrap number being 95/100), where Neandertals composed a separate species with a last common ancestor between 151-kya and 352-kya. This date, utilizing both the Feldhofer and Mezmaiskaya sample, is a more accurate prediction then the previous. As with Krings, Ovchinnikov stresses the same cautious interpretation of the data, but offers that the new evidence reinforces both the techniques and the conclusions of Krings. (Ovchinnikov et al., 2000)

David Caramelli has offers more evidence to support the conclusion that Neandertal and humans did not interbreed (Caramelli et al., 2003). Caramelli's research is unique to the previous studies because it utilizes ancient mtDNA from two Cro-Magnon men fossils (archaic H. Sapiens) dating ~23-kya and ~24-kya and compares it with Neandertal mtDNA sequences. He found that the differences between the Cro-Magnon mtDNA and modern human DNA to be negligible: Cro-Magnon man falls well with in the range of modern human diversity. Moreover, Caramelli discovered that Neandertal mtDNA differed significantly from both the Cro-Magnon and modern human, so much so that unless a very abnormal selection event occurred these Neandertals never interbreed with neighboring Cro-Magnon and, thus, did not contribute to the modern gene pool. However, his data falls short of a proof given the nature of aDNA research. (Caramelli et al., 2003)

The process of extracting fifty-thousand year old DNA is no easy task. The complications and possible sources of contamination have been the main critics of the Neandertal finds (Gilbert et al., 2003). Only more research in the field will resolve the questions created by the research. However, the data suggests the there were at least two distinct species of hominids, suggesting a Replacement model pattern.

CONCLUSIONS:
The problem that lies in both models is the oversimplification of a complex evolutionary history. Understanding of selection pressures and varying mutations rates remains limited. Furthermore, neither of the two models in their present form can reconcile all the known data - both genetic and morphological. No one model has yet sufficiently explained the discrepancies between the various genetic results (mtDNA, Y-Chromosome, β-globin, etc.). The new Neandertal evidence seems to bolster Replacement, but given the available data, a more complex pattern replacement seems likely. Recent attempts to make models that are more complex have also fallen short (Eswaran, 2002; Excoffier, 2002). Erik Trinkaus, of Washington University, best summons up the current state of human origin theory:

I believe that it [Eswaran's model] suffers from a problem shared with the majority of the current and past models of modern human emergence: namely, it tries to explain too much of a geographically and temporally complex process with a single mechanism . . . (Eswaran, 2002, 767).",0,0,5.59,12.5,20882
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Fetal Endocrine System,"Abstract
This article reviews the effects that maternal nutrition can produce in the fetus through leptin and other components of the fetal endocrine system, both immediately and in the long-run. Early, but not late, maternal overnutrition increases fetal plasma leptin and adipose tissue mass, while early, but not late, maternal undernutrition causes fetal hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia and postnatal hyperphagia, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia. Because many adult diseases seem to be pre-programmed in utero, this field has the potential to be very beneficial to society.

Introduction
The developing fetal endocrine system can adjust in response to maternally induced changes in its intrauterine environment. Depending on the nature and duration of the stress, the fetal endocrine system and growth development may alter permanently and may be responsible for diseases such as hypertension, obesity, and insulin insensitivity in adulthood (1). This review will look at the effects that maternal nutrition can have on the fetus and its endocrine system and the role that the protein leptin plays in mediating this. Unless otherwise stated, this article focuses on the sheep; sheep make an ideal human model because the fetal sheep shows similar metabolic responses to the human fetus, undergoes a relatively long gestation, and can be manipulated easily (1, 10).

Leptin plays a role in metabolic regulation
The 16 kDa protein leptin acts as an adiposity signal in the adult. It indicates nutritional status and responds to excess energy by depressing appetite and increasing glucose and fat metabolism (2). Leptin levels rise after food consumption in response to increases in plasma glucose and insulin and help indicate satiety (12). This product of the ob gene acts primarily through brain receptors to modulate hypothalamic control of food intake and sympathetic stimulation of energy expenditure (5). Various tissues express some level of leptin, but the most significant source is adipose tissue (4). Leptin additionally suppresses the orexigenic peptide neuropeptide Y and its mRNA (Neuropeptide Y stimulates hyperphagia and subsequent obesity in the adult and amniotic fluid swallowing as ingestive behavior in the fetus) (5). Leptin levels also correlate with the amount of body fat. As food intake increases and introduces excess energy into the body, lipogenesis is stimulated and the newly synthesized adipose tissue secretes additional leptin (4). The fetal hypothalamus also expresses leptin receptors, suggesting that leptin may also play a role in fetal metabolic regulation (9).

Maternal overnutrition in early to mid pregnancy increases plasma leptin, leptin mRNA expression, and fat deposition in the fetus
In normal fetal development, leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue peaks in the second half of gestation and then undergoes a decline (5). Circulating levels of leptin reflect the amount of leptin mRNA expression in fetal adipose tissue (3), although in humans the placenta may also contribute to plasma leptin levels (5). Maternal pigs that were overfed during the second quarter of pregnancy produced offspring with increased levels of plasma leptin and leptin mRNA in adipose tissue (7). Two explanations have been proposed for this observation. Although a recent study was unable to detect leptin receptor in the ovine placenta (11), an earlier study reported placental leptin receptors, leading to the suggestion that these receptors mediated the direct uptake of maternal leptin into fetal blood (2, 4). Alternatively, induced maternal hyperglycemia, by continuous glucose infusion, causes fetal hyperglycemia and mild fetal hyperinsulinemia. After 14 days of hyperglycemia, the fetus showed a significant increase in leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue (5). Likewise, induced maternal hypoglycemia, by continuous insulin infusion, produces fetal hypoglycemia and subsequent hypoinsulinemia as well as a sharp decline in leptin mRNA expression in fat around the time when hypoinsulinemia begins to appear (5). Further experiments showed that hyperglycemia with an insulin clamp - to test the effects of glucose independently of insulin - did not affect leptin mRNA expression while hyperinsulinemia with a glucose clamp did produce a rapid increase in leptin mRNA levels in white adipose tissue (5). The results from these experiments indicate that hyperglycemia produces an increase in leptin mRNA only by inducing hyperinsulinemia and has no direct effect itself. Maternal overnutrition leading to maternal and fetal hyperglycemia may therefore also act in this manner to mediate increased fetal leptin concentration.

The consequences of these amplified plasma leptin levels are uncertain, but may have one of two opposing effects. Because leptin represses neuropeptide Y function, increased leptin may decrease fetal amniotic fluid intake, affecting gastrointestinal tract development, and promote energy reducing behaviors in the neonate (5). Conversely, fetal leptin may actually make fetal insulin more sensitive to glucose usage, stimulating cell growth, and may also be mitogenic itself, leading to fetal body weight gain (5). It remains undetermined which leptin response predominates in the fetus and neonate and requires further investigation for clarification.

Independently of any leptin-mediated effects, glucose directly promotes moderate fetal fat mass deposition. Insulin does not produce the same effects, indicating that glucose acts through the insulin-independent glucose transporter GLUT 1, and not the insulin-dependent transporter GLUT 4 (8). Remarkably, leptin and fat mass increases do not manifest if the mother is only overfed in late pregnancy, after the final stage of rapid fetal growth (9).

Early maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to obesity and cardiovascular disease
Restriction of maternal diet early in pregnancy has been strongly linked to an increase in obesity, heart disease, and hypertension. The specific mechanisms that produce this effect are still unclear, but seem to involve interactions between leptin, glucose, and insulin like growth factors (IGF) I and II (11). Offspring born to mothers that were temporarily under nutrient restriction early in pregnancy are larger and have more adipose tissue mass and increased levels of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA and growth hormone receptor mRNA in the liver. These hormones may act cooperatively to alter gluconeogenesis permanently, and up-regulation of the IGF receptors may stimulate adipose tissue growth, which may increase the risk for future obesity (1, 11). Under the same conditions, ewes exhibit lower circulating leptin; since maternal and fetal leptin levels correspond positively, one would expect fetal leptin levels to be lower also, although this was not observed in this study (11). Severe maternal undernutrition can also lead to fetal hypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, which depresses fetal leptin levels, as discussed previously. In rats, juvenile offspring of mothers that were undernourished throughout pregnancy present hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, hypertension, and obesity, metabolic deficiencies suggested to be induced in utero (6). The persistence of hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia points to both leptin and insulin resistance since normally high levels of insulin and leptin would depress appetite. High caloric diets greatly magnified these phenomena (6). Although none of the ovine studies examined offspring at juvenile stage, it is reasonable to believe that they would show similar symptoms. In the offspring of undernourished mothers, low ovine fetal leptin levels would also cause postnatal hyperphagia and aggravate the pre-programmed metabolic abnormalities.

As with overnutrition, undernutrition in late gestation differs from that in early or mid gestation. Moderate nutrient deprivation late in pregnancy causes maternal glucose to decrease while maternal and fetal leptin do not change (10, 11). This can be partially explained by the level of nutrient deprivation in the studies. Undernutrition initially stimulates adaptations to maintain the fetal glucose supply such as a decrease in maternal insulin sensitivity, and if the undernutrition is moderate enough then these maternal metabolic actions compensate adequately for the fetus and leptin levels remain steady (10). Additionally, the notable difference between the time-dependent effects of maternal nutrition, with respect to both overnutrition and undernutrition, may be due to greater fetal glucose requirements at the end of gestation (11).

Conclusion
A consensus on the exact effects of maternal nutrition on offspring endocrine systems and future health remains to be determined, but some key points in the current field have been identified. Excessive or limited maternal nutrition most likely induces metabolic changes in utero, largely through leptin, with significant health and endocrinological consequences resulting from this 'fetal programming.' In particular, maternal undernutrition has been linked to offspring at increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, etc. Additionally, the timing of the maternal nutrition disturbance is significant, with the greatest fetal effects seen as a result of early to mid maternal over- or undernutrition. The implications this field has for society are vastly importance since cardiovascular and obesity-linked diseases cost billions of dollars a year. With the knowledge that so many adult diseases probably derive from metabolic problems initiated in gestation, devoting more resources to pre-natal course could be immensely more cost-efficient and disease preventive in the long run.",76.89,63.39,63.66,48.24,9769
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,"Mn (III) TPPS4: A metallophorphryin used for tumor identification in MRI
","From as early as 1948, scientists have studied the potential of porphryins and metalloporphyrins in cancer detection and therapy. For reasons unknown then, these compounds had high affinities for neoplasms (tumors) when injected into mice.1 In fact, porphyrin concentration was highest in and near necrotic areas (unprogrammed cell death). The potential for metalloporphyrins in tumor identification was further uncovered with the effects of paramagnetic substances on proton relaxation time of surrounding tissues.2 While X-ray imaging is used for bony, dense structures, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an application of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, has been used with soft tissues for decades. The magnetic moments of paramagnetic species such as MnTPPS4 significantly enhance MRI signal in the soft tissues to which it is bound, making it an optimal contrast agent.

Synthesis
MnTPPS4 can be synthesized by heating meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine (H2TPPS4) and manganese (II) acetate in acetic acid under reflux for 8 hours.4 Air bubbling through the reflux solution oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III).

Formula here
The presence of MnTPPS4 and disappearance of H2TPPS4 can be confirmed with UV spectroscopy:

Figure here
Figure 1: Absorption spectra of equimolar aqueous solutions of H2TPPS4 (full line) and MnTPPS4 (dotted line) 2

Additionally, the absorbance maxima of Mn(III)TPPS4 occur at 465, 561, and 593 nm, while the absorbance maxima of Mn(II)TPPS4 are at 434, 572, and 612 nm.3

While the synthesis of MnTPPS4 has been documented since the 1960's, and it is commercially available, it is a very polar molecule and is thus often contaminated with un-identified by- product. Bockhorst and coworkers4 proposed an optimized purification method: washing the product multiple times with hot

acetic acid, then hot ethanol, and dissolving in aqueous Na2CO3.

The solution is then filtered, acidified with HCl, centrifuged and dried; this procedure is done twice. Finally, drying over KOH in a desiccator gives the desired product, a dark green, metallic solid, at 98% purity.

Tetraphenylporphine sulfonate, TPPS4 can be synthesized by heating meso-tetraphenylporphine with concentrated sulfuric acid over a steam bath for 4h.5 Meso-tetraphenylporphine can be prepared by refluxing pyrrole and benzaldehyde in propionic acid.6

Tetraphenylsulfonyl is a hydrophilic water-soluble porphryin with a highly developed π-conjugation system. Its Mn(III) complex has been extensively studied as an MRI contrast agent. Mn(III) is a high spin d4 transition metal ion that has four unpaired electrons; it is thus paramagnetic. The geometry of the molecule is square planar, with the Mn(III) chelated by the four nitrogen atoms of a porphine that has four attached sulfonyl groups.

Discussion
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is the observation of the frequency at which magnetic nuclei in molecules come into resonance with an externally applied electromagnetic field. The signal depends on a variety of factors, including field strength and

concentration. It follows that Magnetic Resonance Imaging is essentially a measure of proton density. When the magnetic field varies linearly across an object, the signal intensity is proportional to proton concentration. Tumor identification is possible because of differences in relaxation rates of bulk water of normal tissues and tumors.3 However, the difference is usually no more than 2-3 fold. T1, longitudinal relaxation time, is the taken by a proton to align with the external magnetic field. As referenced by Runge and coworkers,7 longitudinal relation rate (1/T1) can be described by the following equation:

Formula here
where ε is the viscosity of the solvent, k is the Boltzman constant, N is the concentration of ions, T is the absolute temperature, and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for the hydrogen nucleus. The variable of interest is μ, the effective magnetic moment. As the equation shows, spin lattice rate (another name for 1/T1) is directly proportional to the square of μ. Paramagnetic species alter the local magnetic field to enhance proton relaxation (spin-lattice T1 and spin-spin relaxation T2 rates) of neighboring nuclei. T2, transverse magnetization time, is also tissue specific; it depends on the exchange of energy and interaction of spins with neighboring nuclei. In essence, T2 measures decay of magnetization perpendicular to the main magnetic field. Through a complex set of equations, it can be determined that paramagnetic species also shortens T2.7 This is unfavorable, as a decrease in T2 weakens signal.7 An optimal contrast agent would therefore reduce T1, increasing spin lattice relaxation rate, without significantly compromising T2.

In the presence of an externally applied magnetic field, the magnetic moments of MnTPPS4 that were previously randomly aligned become preferentially aligned with the field.7 This local magnetic field produced by the paramagnetic species shortens T1 and T2 of surrounding protons in the tumor. This paramagnetic effect decreases with distance:

Formula here
where r is the mean distance from paramagnetic center to the proton.3

Thus, an effective paramagnetic contrast agent should include a high spin, metal ion with a large magnetic moment and easily accessible axial coordination sites. Chen and coworkers3 demonstrated that spin lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) increases linearly with concentration of various metallo-TPPS4 complexes. Of these, the slope is steepest with Mn(III) compared to various other ions and metallo-TPPS4 complexes (Figure 2). It is the most effective in enhancing proton relaxation due to its four unpaired electrons and ability to coordinate axial ligands. While Mn(II) would have five unpaired electrons and theoretically induce an even shorter T1, Mn(II)TPPS4 is not as stable in solution as Mn(III)TPPS4 because it is readily oxidized.

A variety of paramagnetic species have been considered for use as MRI contrast agents - both free and chelated metal ions. Aside from enhancing relaxation rates as determined in vitro, toxicity, stability in human plasma and at various pH, clearance from blood, and tissue distribution must also be taken into account when examining an MRI contrast agent. NMR contrast media can also be classified by method of uptake into body: oral, intravenous, inhalational. Furthermore, blood transport bio distribution and relaxation efficiency are related to differences in binding and aggregation properties of the metalloporphyrin that

are dose dependent. For example, Fe(III) transforms into low spin dimers at physiological pH. It also aggregates on the surface of bovine serum albumin (mimicking human plasma) 5-7 times more than MnTPPS4; antiferromagnetic coupling between metals ions in the aggregates disables proton relaxation enhancement ability.8 Also, the dose of metal ions needed for clinical efficiency as a contrast agent is very toxic; chelating the ion significantly lowers toxicity.

Perhaps the most fundamental quality of any tumor identification/contrast agent is the ability to localize in tumors. This selective retention of porphyrins in tumors makes it of special interest in deep tumor detection. Figge and coworkers found that when porphryin was injected into tumor-bearing mice, most of it migrated to the tumor within 24-48 hours.9 Porphyrin localization was directly observable by the red fluorescence in the tumors that lasted 10-14 days.9 It has been suggested that porphyrin aggregation is involved with tumor localization.10 Fiel and coworker also found that porphyrins tend to be localized mostly in soluble and stromal fractions (connective tissue).10 Mn(III)TPPS4 accumulated in tumors at ratios as high as 1.0:0.3:0.01 (tumor:liver:muscle). In analyzing subcelleular distribution of Mn(III)TPPS4, it was found that accumulation occurs mostly in the extracellular compartments of the tumor, possibly due to mechanism of localization that depends on volume; interstitial space in tumors is large enough to favor retention of large sized porphryins. Finally, Figge and coworkers also noted that while hydrophobic porphyrins would be transported across cell membranes more easily, charged porphyrins (like Mn(III)TPPS4) would remain extracellular. 10

Conclusion
Mn(III)TPPS4 has been extensively studied for its use as an MRI contrast agent. Its paramagnetism gives it the ability to enhance proton relaxation time and enhance MRI signal, and its porphryin component is useful in tumor detection in that it is selectively retained in those tissues. Of various metallo-TPPS4 compounds studied, it is the most stable in vivo and thus an optimal contrast agent for detection of deep tumors.",0,17.09,5.05,2.71,9307
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Global reproductive strategies of Tursiops and Stenella (family Delphinidae),"Introduction
Generally, females make a larger investment toward future generations than males. Not only is production of eggs more expensive than production of sperm, but males essentially have an unlimited supply of sperm while females are born with a limited number of eggs (Campbell and Reece 2002). In placental mammals, the female carries the offspring in her uterus until it is ready to be born, at a great cost to her. If parental care is involved, the male is not involved. Therefore, the limiting factor for the fitness of mammalian females is expected to be the number of pregnancies they can successfully carry and the number of offspring they can successfully raise. The fitness of mammalian males, who, in contrast to females, expend very little energy on reproduction, is expected to be limited by the number of females they can successfully mate with. Females, therefore, should be choosy about which males they mate with and males should compete over opportunities to mate with the females (Freeman and Herron 2004).

The different limiting factors for males and females usually results in either promiscuous or polygynous mating systems. In a promiscuous mating system, males attempt to mate with as many females as possible and do not form any sort of bond with the female. Females also try to mate with as many males as possible. Different males will have very different degrees of success. In a polygynous mating system, one male mates with many different females, but forms a longer bond with the females than in a promiscuous system (Ricklefs 2001). In both of these systems, males compete for access to females, and females mate with the male that can best compete.

Members of the family delphinidae, which includes dolphins, killer whales, pilot whales, and many other species, are viviparous mammals. Therefore, it is expected that females will generally be choosy, males will be competitive, and the mating systems will probably be either promiscuous or polygynous. Delphinids are usually sexually dimorphic-males are generally larger than the females and may have a different shape (Animal Diversity Web, 1999 and Tolley et al. 1995). In general, males may be larger than females if male-male competition is an important selecting factor in reproduction. If males combat for access to the females, larger males will have an advantage, and be more likely to pass their genes that code for large size on to the next generation. However, because delphinidae encompasses so many genera and has a worldwide distribution (Animal Diversity Web, 1999), different mating strategies exist and male-male competition is not the sole determining factor for a successful mating for Stenella and Tursiops . The mating systems of the genus Tursiops (which includes bottlenose dolphins) and the genus Stenella (which includes spinner dolphins) have been studied more than many other genera, due to their tolerance of people and relatively easier access. Therefore, the focus of this review will be only on those two genera.

Delphinids use different reproductive strategies in different parts of the world. Major studies of the delphinid mating system have been done in Shark Bay, Western Australia (Connor et al. 1996 and Krützen et al. 2003); Sarasota, Florida (Owen at al. 2002 and Tolley et al. 1995); and in the eastern Pacific, along the coasts of Mexico and South America (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Globally, males and females preferentially associate together when the females are reproductively active (Connor et al. 1996 and Owen et al. 2002), although males may interact with females even if the female is pregnant or not in estrous (Connor et al. 1996 and Owen et al. 2002). Dolphins in Western Australia were mostly polygynous, although the males exhibited two alternative strategies of controlling females. Dolphins in the eastern Pacific showed a gradient of polygyny in the eastern spinner population to promiscuity in the whitebelly spinner population. Dolphins in Sarasota may either be polygynous or promiscuous. A major limitation is that all of the studies focused mainly on the male reproductive strategy. Female choice may also be important in dolphins, and further study focusing on females is necessary.

Western Australia
The mating system of dolphins in Shark Bay seems to be polygynous because a few males mate with a group of females in a semi-long term bond. Male bottlenose dolphins interact aggressively with females using a herding technique to form consortships. Females are generally unreceptive to this herding, even if they are reproductively active. In order to capture a female, males will accelerate toward her, and control her using vocal popping noises and aggressive actions such as striking her with their flukes, charging at her, and jerking their heads at her. The females will usually try to escape, but are generally recaptured. Males use two alternative reproductive strategies in order to herd females: 1) Males form long-term first order alliances with 1-2 other males in order to herd females (Connor et al. 1996). Two of these alliances may combine (a second order alliance), forming groups of 4-6 males, which gives those males a better chance to steal females away from another alliance and to protect the females they have from theft by other male alliances (Krützen et al. 2003). 2) Alternatively, males may combine into super-alliances of up to 14 males, which makes them even more effective at both stealing and guarding females (Krützen et al. 2003).

In the first reproductive strategy, males in either first or second order alliances were more closely related than would be expected by chance (Krützen et al. 2003). Males may form alliances not only to increase their chances of successfully subduing females, but also because these alliances increase their inclusive fitness. By helping a close relative monopolize a single female, a male dolphin will benefit indirectly if his relative mates with the female. Although one male dolphin may not mate with the female, some of his genes will be passed on to the next generation if a close relative mates with her. According to Hamilton's law, altruistic behavior will spread if the cost to the actor is low, the benefit to the recipient is high, and the actor and recipient are closely related (Freeman and Herron 2004). The cost to male dolphins for guarding a female can be high because males may fight viciously over females (Animal Diversity Web, 1999). However, because these altruistic alleles exist, the benefit of producing related offspring is apparently high enough to overcome the cost of fighting for females.

In the second reproductive strategy, males were not closely related. Some males form super-alliances of about 14 individuals. The males will form first order alliances with other males of this super alliance. In contrast to the first strategy, where the alliances were stable and long term, first order alliances in the second strategy are transient and constantly changing. The males in a super-alliance are not any more closely related than would be expected by chance. The males may form these larger alliances in order to steal females away from first and second order alliances, and then compete among themselves for the opportunity to mate with the female (Krützen et al. 2003). The males in super alliances do not gain any indirect fitness benefits by being in the alliance. The only benefit seems to be that the larger the alliance is, the more successful it will be at both taking and keeping females.

However, the reproductive strategies of the females have not been thoroughly studied and are still only mostly speculation. Due to the fact that males can monopolize females, it appears that intrasexual selection among males is occurring in this population of dolphins (Freeman and Herron 2004). Males that can most successfully control females are most likely to mate, and pass their genes on to the next generation. However, the mating system may be more complicated than simply the male who wins the fight has the opportunity to mate with the female. There is evidence that female choice may also be a selective factor. Females may use their escape behavior as a means to test the physical fitness of the males (Connor et al.1996). By forcing the male to chase after her, she may be effectively selecting to only mate with healthy, strong males. There is also evidence that females may directly choose a mate. Researchers have observed elaborate displays by males around consorted females that suggest that females may use those displays to directly choose a mate among the males that are herding them (Connor et al.1996). In addition, there is also evidence that females willingly socialize with an alliance of males, without any agonistic behavior (Connor et al. 1996). Some males may attempt to form relationships with females in order to increase their chances of being chosen by the female, also suggesting that female choice is an important factor.

The mating system is further complicated by the fact that females are not entirely monopolized by a few males. Females go into estrous several times a year, and so mate with many different males. It is unclear why females would be polyestrous, which increases the number of times they will be harassed by males. Herding of females is costly and dangerous to the females because it decreases the amount of time the female can spend foraging for food and the males can be very aggressive. A possible explanation is that, if a female is monopolized by a less desirable male during one cycle, she will have the opportunity to mate with a more desirable male during a second cycle (Connor et al.1996). It seems as if looking for the best genes is not a satisfactory explanation, especially because females may not even have a choice of mates. Females seem to usually mate with the group of males that manages to successfully capture her, which may or may not be males with the best genes. There is no guarantee that a female will be captured by a group of males with better genes during her next cycle.

An alternative explanation may be that mating with many males decreases the risk of infanticide. In some primate species, the risk of infanticide by a male is less if the female has copulated with that male. The male presumably realizes that the infant may be his, and so is less aggressive towards it. It is possible that by mating with many different males, female dolphins decrease the risk of aggression by males towards their infants (Connor et al. 1996). However, there are large differences between primates and cetaceans, so it may not be accurate to describe dolphin behavior using primate studies.

Both the study by Connor et al. (1996) and Krützen et al. (2003) focused largely on the reproductive strategies of the males. Further study of female dolphins is necessary to fully understand the complex mating system. Studies of female sociality are necessary to see if female choice is an important part of the mating system. If female choice is important, then what kind of males do females prefer? Paternity tests of calves would reveal which males are most successful, either through male-male competition or female choice. Further studies may also answer the question of why females are polyestrous even though it is detrimental to their health.

Eastern Pacific
In contrast to the studies conducted in Shark Bay, Perrin and Mesnick (2003) did not directly observe dolphin behavior. Spinner dolphins live offshore, so it is difficult to study them directly. The study was instead conducted using incidentally killed spinner dolphins that had been caught in tuna nets. The weight of the epididymis + testis was compared between the eastern spinner dolphin and the whitebelly spinner dolphin, which is a hybrid of the eastern spinner and a Hawaiian spinner. The range of the whitebelly spinner is larger than the range of the eastern spinner, but the ranges of these two populations greatly overlap (Fig. 1).

The whitebelly spinner dolphin and the eastern spinner dolphin were found to have a gradient of mating systems, ranging from promiscuity in the whitebelly form to polygyny in the eastern form. The whitebelly population had a greater testis + epididymis weight than the eastern population. Increased testis size can evolve if the sperm must compete. If a female mates with several males, the male who can produce the most sperm (largest testis) is most likely to successfully fertilize the female. Therefore, a large testis size is expected in a promiscuous mating system, where the female mates with many males. The whitebelly population had larger testis + epidermis weights than the eastern population, suggesting that the whitebelly dolphin mating system is more promiscuous than the spinner population. The eastern spinner showed greater sexual dimorphism than the whitebelly spinner, suggesting that the mating system of the spinner dolphin is polygynous. Sexual dimorphism is usually a result of male-male competition, which may evolve when males can control access to females or resources the females need. The largest males can control access to females, resulting in several females mating with one male (polygyny). Because the male can directly control the female, she will not mate with many other males. There is less selective pressure for more competitive sperm, so it is expected that the eastern testis + epididymis would be smaller than the whitebelly (Perrin and Mesnick 2003).

However, because the dolphins were not studied directly, it is unknown how exactly the mating systems work and if the assignment of a promiscuous mating system to the whitebelly form and a polygynous mating system to the eastern form is correct. Sexual dimorphism can occur in both polygynous and promiscuous mating systems. Males in both mating systems compete to mate with as many females as possible. Competition between males facilitates the evolution of dimorphism in size, coloration, behavior, etc (Ricklefs 2001). Therefore, the conclusion by Perrin and Mesnick (2003) that the eastern spinner is polygynous because it shows greater sexual dimorphism is not necessarily true. Their argument is strengthened by the congruent data from epididymis + testis size that suggests the whitebelly form is more promiscuous than the eastern form. However, direct study of the dolphins would be the most convincing way to confirm that the mating system assignment is correct.

Perrin and Mesnick (2003) discuss and dismiss several alternative hypotheses and confounding factors that could account for the difference in epididymis + testis weight between the eastern form and the whitebelly form. Whitebelly dolphins are, on average, about 5 cm longer than eastern dolphins (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Therefore, larger epididymis + testis weight of whitebelly dolphins may only be an incidental result of their larger overall size. However, size does not appear to be a confounding factor because whitebelly epididymis + testis weight was still larger than eastern epididymis + testis weight for dolphins of the same length (Perrin and Mesnick 2003). Another possible confounding factor could be that whitebelly and eastern dolphins reach sexual maturity at different ages or times of the year. Juvenile eastern dolphins-which would have a smaller epididymis + testis weight because they are not sexually mature-may have been compared against adult whitebelly dolphins in the study, leading to skewed results. Perrin and Mesnick (2003) controlled for this by limiting the study to adult males whose right testis + epididymis weight was at least 88g. Testis + epididymis weight is, on average, 88g at spermatogenesis, so all of the males should have been sexually mature. Samples were also collected over every month of the year, allowing for different reproductive seasons. Size and time of reproduction should therefore not be confounding factors, and it is probably an accurate conclusion that whitebelly epididymis + testis weight is larger than eastern epididymis + testis weight.

Another possible alternative explanation for the difference in epididymis + testis weight could be a greater chase-and-capture pressure from tuna fishermen on the eastern spinners. A greater chase-and-capture pressure may have a depressive effect on male reproductive function, thereby causing the epididymis + testis weight to be smaller. Perrin and Mesnick (2003) reject this possible explanation because annual pregnancy rates in the two populations are comparable, which would not be expected if the eastern spinner male reproductive system was depressed. They also found that a comparable percentage of whitebelly spinners (17%) and eastern spinners (22%) were accidentally captured in nets. It appears that there is not greater chase-and-capture pressure on the eastern spinner dolphin than on the whitebelly spinner dolphin.

Direct study of both the whitebelly and eastern spinner dolphins should be conducted in order to confirm Perrin and Mesnick's (2003) conclusions and to see how males and females interact. Are the spinner dolphins similar to the Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins? Shark Bay males form alliances that aggressively herd females. Are interactions between male and female spinner dolphins also agonistic? Do male spinner dolphins form alliances in order to herd females (especially in the polygynous eastern population), and if so, are they related to their fellow alliance members?

Sarasota
Male bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota normally bond with another male during their teens for a long-term, stable relationship, but rarely associate with other males. Owen et al. (2002) found no evidence of pair bonds combining to find second order alliances or super-alliances, as was found in Shark Bay dolphins (Connor et al. 1996 and Krützen et al. 2003). Dolphins in Shark Bay are smaller than dolphins in Sarasota (Tolley et al. 1995), and a social system of limited interaction between unpaired males may have evolved in order to lessen the occurrence of agonistic interactions between males (Owen et al. 2002). The larger a male is, the more potential he has to injure another male. Injuries between Sarasota males fighting over females may be more severe than injuries to Shark Bay males, facilitating the evolution of less interaction between Sarasota males.

Sarasota dolphins are sexually dimorphic (Tolley et al. 1995) suggesting that the mating system is either polygynous or promiscuous. Males do not possess ornate secondary sexual characters; instead differences between the sexes are size related. Males are larger than females, have larger locomotor muscles, and have larger flukes and dorsal fins. The increased size of the flukes and dorsal fins and locomotor muscles may give the males greater propulsion, better maneuvering, and better thermoregulation which could be used either to chase females or in fights with other males over females (Tolley et al. 1995). Tolley et al. (1995) cite a study by Trivers (1985), which suggests that Sarasota dolphins may be promiscuous. Trivers (1985) found that moderate sexual dimorphism suggests a mating system of males competing for access to dispersed females, instead of a more polygynous system where the largest males are able to monopolize females. The dolphins in Sarasota exhibited moderate sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the mating system may be promiscuous.

However, adult male dolphins associate with potentially reproductive females during the breeding season; subsequently, males and females may form long-term bonds, which are not seen in promiscuous mating systems (Ricklefs 2001). Compared to the Shark Bay male-female interactions, the interactions during the breeding season between males and females in Sarasota were shorter, less stable, and less agonistic. However, male interactions with potentially reproductive females during the non-breeding season were more stable than during the breeding season. Males may form affiliative relationships with females during the non-breeding season in order to increase their chance of being chosen by the female during the breeding season (Owen et al. 2002). However, Owen et al. (2002) did not report the nature of the interactions between males and females, only how often males associated with potentially reproductive and non-reproductive females. The time of interaction between males and females was shorter than for the Shark Bay dolphins, suggesting that males in Sarasota do not guard mates for long, so the relationship is probably less antagonistic. In addition, the fact that males attempt to form relationships with females when they are not reproductively active suggests that female choice, and not solely male-male competition, is important.

It is difficult to conclude from these two studies if the mating system of Sarasota dolphins is polygynous, promiscuous, or possibly something else. Evidence is supported for both a polygynous and a promiscuous mating system. It might be possible that two alternative strategies exist in this population, such as in the eastern Pacific spinner dolphins. Research comparing testis size for two different populations in Sarasota may be helpful in determining if the mating system is promiscuous.

Conclusion
The mating systems of Tursiops and Stenella are mostly either promiscuous or polygynous. Western Australia dolphins tend to be polygynous. Eastern Pacific dolphins may either be polygynous (the eastern form) or promiscuous (the whitebelly form). It is inconclusive whether Sarasota dolphins are promiscuous or polygynous. Male-male competition appeared to be an important selective factor globally; female choice may also be an important selecting factor, but further research focusing more on females needs to be conducted in order to fully understand the mating system.

Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Complementation Between Histidine Requiring Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Introduction
Complementation experiments test for function. If two mutations separately produce a phenotype but when combined into a diploid/heterozygote state correct the defects of the other and recapitulate the wild type phenotype, then they are said to complement each other. Two mutations are noncomplementary if the mutant phenotype persists when they are combined. The organism used in this experiment, Saccharomyces cerevisiae which can form diploid as well as haploid cells, allows for the use of complementation analysis. Complementation tests provide information about the genetic location of a particular mutation. Complementing mutations are on different genes and noncomplementing mutations are within the same gene. It is also possible to distinguish between intergenic complementation (as described above) and intragenic complementation where two mutations are found within the same gene. Generally mutations within the same gene would not revert back to wild type; however, if they are two different mutations within the same gene then the wild type phenotype can be observed. Intragenic complementation is characterized by slower growth and reduced activity or heat stability of the affected enzyme (Jeyabalan 57). This experiment used complementation assays to find out which gene in the yeast histidine biosynthesis pathway a particular unknown mutation is located and also to observe intergenic versus intragenic complementation.

Materials and Methods
See the Genetics 306 Lab Manual for details of the procedure (Jeyabalan 60-63). Refer to Table 1 for known A and α strain mutations and note that A and α have secondary auxotrophic mutations in different genes. If complementation occurred between mutant strains then growth would be present at the diploid mating junctions on the minimal medium indicating that the wild type histidine synthesizing pathway was restored.

Table 1: Known A and α strain mutations

Table here
Results
After one and two days of incubation, growth was evident at all mating junctions on the minimal medium except α2/A2, α2/A3, α2/A4; α4/A6; α5/A2, α5/A3, α5/A4; and α6/A3, α6/A4. On the fifth day growth appeared at α2/A2 and α5/A2. Confluent lines of growth were present along A1, α3, and α6. A few small colonies were present at the α2/A4 and α5/A4 mating intersection after five days of incubation. See Figure 1 for a picture depiction of the growth on the minimal medium and minimal medium plus histidine plate. Growth was present at all of the mating junctions on the minimal plus histidine plate. Confluent growth was found along A1 and α3 lines.

Discussion
Figure 1: Results of A and α matings on minimal and minimal plus hisitidine medium plates

Figure here
All of the matings should grow on the minimal plus histidine control plate because the different secondary auxotrophic requirements for each strain A and α would complement the other in the diploid state. This plate was used to ensure matings were efficient and that the second auxotrophic mutations were present. The results show growth at all mating junctions indicating that the correct matings occurred; however, there was confluent growth along A1, α3, and α6. This could happen if the strain lost its second auxotrophic requirement so these results indicate that A1, α3, and α6 are no longer trp-, ade-, and ade-, respectively.

The growth patterns on minimal medium were used to generate Table 2. Growth at a mating junction on the minimal plate implies that the wild type histidine synthesizing pathway was restored due to complementation between the two histidine mutations in each strain. Complementation between the two strain's secondary auxotrophic mutations must have also occurred if growth is present on the minimal plate.

Table 2: Table of complementation results after one, two, and five days of incubationand the genetic locus of α strain mutations

Table here
Plus and minus signs designate growth or lack of growth, respectively, at mating junctions

*Expected results are in black and observed results are in red

The genetic locus of the histidine mutation in each α strain was determined by first identifying the mating(s) that did not complement, that is, where no cells grew at the junction on minimal medium. The known mutation in the A strain at that junction would indicate the gene that is mutated in the α strain because mutations at the same genetic locus do not complement each other. Using this logic, the α4 strain did not complement with A6 indicating that it has a mutation in the his1 gene, Table 2.

After one and two days of incubation the expected non-complementing diploids for the α2, α5, and α6 strains were A2, A3, and A4. The common mutation in these A strains is his4C which specifies that the mutation in α2, α5, and α6 is in the his4C gene. However, since his4C2 in A2 and his4C3 in A3 are closely linked it is not possible to determine the exact genetic location within the his4C gene the α mutations are in after only two days of incubation. After five days of incubation, α2 and α5 complemented with A2. Such slow growth is characteristic of intragenic complementation and indicates that the mutated gene in α2 and α5 is not his4C2 but could be his4C3 or another mutation within the his4C gene. Since α6 did not complement after five days (expected results) the mutation could be within hisC2 or 3 or another his4C gene. Notably, the observed results show that α6 did complement A2. A possible explanation is that this mating junction became contaminated with a complementary strain during the plating procedure.

The expected results show that the α3 strain should not complement with A5 indicating that it has a mutation in his5, but the observed results show growth at this junction. Figure 1 shows that confluent growth was along the α3 line in this minimal medium which could only happen if this strain lost both of its auxotrophic mutations, his and ade, and reverted to wild type. The A1 strain also shows a full line of growth on this plate indicating that it lost both histidine and tryptophan mutations.

The genetic event responsible for the few small colonies at the intersections of the noncomplementing strains α2/A4 and α5/A4 could be mutational reversion or suppression. The histidine and other auxotrophic mutations could revert back to their wild type forms, or a second site could be mutated which also reverts back to the wild type phenotype.

Summary
This experiment used complementation analysis to map the genetic locus of five unknown histidine mutations, Table 2. Intergenic and intragenic complementation was observed. The observed results varied from the expected results by showing confluent growth on minimal and minimal plus histidine medium which confer information about which mutations have been lost in the strains. Finally, mutational reversion was noted after five days of growth at the junction of several noncomplementing strains.",0,21.48,9.29,6.71,6941
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Nest Selection in Weaver Birds,"Introduction
All bird species reproduce through the use of a cleidoic egg, a structure which utilizes a hard shell to protect the developing embryo inside. This egg must be placed in an appropriate environment in order to grow correctly and hatch into a healthy chick (Hansell, 2000). The vulnerability and special requirements of the egg led to the construction of special locations to place the eggs which eventually led to the current nests that are created by today's birds. These nests can range from simple mounds of dirt where decaying refuse is placed inside in order to maintain a suitable temperature for the developing eggs, to the simple cup shaped nests commonly put together by many species of birds, and to the elaborate woven nests that weavers create. The type of nest required depends on several factors such as the level of dependency of the offspring, level of safety from common predators, protection from the elements, and mate selection. This leads to the main question of the paper of what in fact makes a nest suitable for a certain species of bird, specifically Village and Baya Weavers.

Chick Development and Nest Location
The level of development for a newly hatched chick is one of the main determining factors in deciding what kind of nest a bird needs to create. This level of development can be ranked to eight classes according to Mike Hansell (Table 1). Stages of development range from extreme independence to total dependence with varying degrees in between. The majority of birds in the wild, almost 70% of all species produce offspring which are stage 8, or altricial type 2 (Hansell, 2000). These naked and defenseless chicks need a protective home in a location where it is out of reach from predators and shielded from the elements.

Table here
Table 1: Eight Classes of chick development. (Table taken from Hansell, 2000)

Another important consideration for the success of a nest is the potential location that is selected for the nest. Several factors are included into this such as a specific location on a tree, the type of tree used, thickness of the branches and other variables all playing a critical role in determining the odds of success. Obviously a nest affixed to a thick branch is more secure and can withstand the wind better thereby lowering the chance it may get blown down, yet at the same time the larger branch increases the possibility a predator such as a snake can then enter the nest and eat the eggs. A field study done by Suhel Quader (2006) analyzed these various attributes over several years with nesting Baya Weavers (Ploceus philippinus). His first study found that there was a strong correlation between fledgling success rate and date of clutch completion which suggests that there is an optimal time for building a nest and starting a brood (Figure 1).

Figure here
Figure 1: Proportion of Successful Nests Relative to Date of Clutch Completion

Overall through the experiment Quader found that fledgling success rate was highest on nests that were attached to thorny branches, high off the ground, and on thick branches. Since nest success went up with increasing branch size this

suggests that the stability of the nest is more important than the increase in predation that such a nest would experience from being on a thicker branch and therefore more accessible. Another important thing to note is that fledgling success increased with the use of finer fibers where the nest is possibly more insulated from the elements and has a stability advantage over nests constructed of course fibers.

Is Color a Determining Factor in Nest Selection and Construction?
The color of the nest should be an important and easily assessable factor in determining the quality of a nest by a male for construction and a female for choosing an appropriate nest. The ideal color should optimally be green, which is the color of fresh foliage and the color brown should be selected against since it indicates that the vegetation is dead. If this is the case then we should optimally see a selection by males for green nest building materials and a strong preference for green nests over brown ones by the females in nest selection.

Nicholas and Elsie Collias performed a study on a group of Village Weaver birds, (Ploceus cucullatus), where they separated a population of young birds and created two different groups which were then deprived of normal nesting materials for certain amounts of time. A control group of normally reared weaver birds was used in order to compare the results with the weavers that were completely deprived of anything closely resembling nesting materials. They then tested the birds by using uniformly sized materials of varying colors, from green to white and then counted the number of times each color was selected. This experiment was performed on six consecutive days while the birds were seven months old for the deprived birds. The results show that even on the first day of seeing these objects green was picked more often than the other colors and especially on the final days of the studies where green was the popular choice 79 percent of the time (Table 2). The control birds also showed an immediate preference for green under similar testing procedures.

Table here
Table 2: Selection of nest materials of different colors by four male weavers (Table taken from Collias & Collias, 1984)

This innate preference for selecting green nest building materials makes sense for males since the green vegetation should be the most flexible and workable which is required in order to weave a complex nest.

The idea of color selection also applies to females when choosing nests and was tested via an experiment by C.H. Jacobs, N.E. Collias, and J.T. Fujimoto (1978). They tested the response that females had to nests of different color by painting nests either brown or green. A fresh nest created in the wild begins green and lasts about two days before it begins to yellow and then eventually turns brown approximately a week later as the vegetation dies. Ideally the females should pick the nest that provides the safest environment for her eggs which should be the freshest and best constructed nest. Since older nests have spent more time in the sun and weather their strength should be somewhat compromised compared to a fresh nest (Jacobs et al., 1978), influencing the female to pick the newest and greenest nest that she can find. If this is the case then the results should show that females pick the green nests preferentially over the brown nests, regardless if it is a nest painted green versus a normal nest. The data in Table 3 suggests that the paint used had little effect on the females choosing nests and there was almost no difference in choosing between a normal nest and a green painted nest, whereas there was a slight preference for a green color over brown. The results from this experiment show that the females seem to visit nests based on the amount of displays that the male does at any given nest instead of picking a nest based on color. The males in turn display at all newly built nests equally independent of what color it was painted which leads to the fact that the once the female accepts the nest temporarily she uses some other method to determine if it is adequate, such as quality of the weave and the display of male (Jacobs et al., 1978).

Table here
Table 3: Female nest acceptances both temporary and permanent

Conclusion
The manor in which birds select their nests can be identified as somewhat of a common sense approach as in placing it in an area that is safest from harm, whether it be nature of predators, yet it can also these simple answers can be more complex than they first appear. The study with nest location by Quader showed us that there are pros and cons to virtually all locations such as if you nest on a thorny tree you will reduce the amount of predation from snakes, yet the predation from mice ends up equaling that of snakes since they also have a safe place to live. The study also showed the importance of things that aren't so obvious such as an optimal time exists for building a nest and starting a brood to achieve maximum survival of fledglings. This then leads to the question of how birds decide to place their nests in certain locations and if this is a learned behavior or just an innate ability such as the use of color selection among Village Weavers. Male weavers are born with a predisposition towards the color green because they know that is the optimal color of material to build their nests. Overall I find it fascinating that these amazing birds are able to build such complex nests with essentially trial and error and are able to use risk management to find the ideal places for their nests and I believe this will provide researchers questions to study for years to come.",0,0,0,0,8861
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Fungal Eye Infections Due to ReNu MoistureLoc,"Introduction
Numerous types of fungi are able to infect the eye, including Fusarium, Aspergillus, Curvularia, and Candida (4). The fungus responsible for the recent outbreaks of keratitis (infection of the cornea) due to ReNu MoistureLoc use is thought to be Fusarium species. There are multiple species within the genus Fusarium, with Fusarium solani being known as the most prevalent and dangerous variety. Fusarium is commonly found on plants or in the soil in warm, humid regions around the world.

Fusarium is a type of filamentous fungus, which means that it contains hyphae. A hypha is a long, branching, tube-like filament which may composes the majority of tissue in a fungus(1). When hyphae bundle together, a mycellium is formed. The mycellium functions to feed, grow, and eventually produce a reproductive structure (e.g., mushroom). A fungus starts out as a spore, and as it divides, cells making up hyphae are generated and grow outward in a thread-like fashion. Unlike normal cell division, hyphae grow by lengthening the tips on the ends, and when the proper length is reached, a new division known as a septum is formed between the old cell and the new cell. The same method can be used to make branches. Although there are walls dividing the boundaries of the cells, cytoplasm is shared between the cells. The movement of cytoplasm throughout the hyphae is known as cytoplasmic streaming (10). This allows nutrients to be shared along the entire fungus. Hyphae are initially composed of haploid cells, but if the hyphae of one fungus joins the hyphae from another fungus of the same species, they may fuse and form multinucleate cells.

In context of Fusarium keratitis, the hyphae from the fungus may protrude through lesions in the cornea to gain access to the inside of the cornea. If it can get past the primary defenses, such as the skin or other mucosal associated lymphatic tissue (SALT and MALT respectively) tissue, then it can cause an infection. However the SALT and MALT tissues are reasonably effective at keeping Fusarium out of the body. Lesions in the cornea could be caused by physical damage (e.g., small particles in the air, plant matter) or by improper care for contact lenses. Treatments for fungi are limited because they share very similar DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis pathways to humans (4). Once the fungus gains access inside the cornea, it may grow and infiltrate other areas of the eye.

Immune Response
The cornea has two main defenses against pathogens:1) Langerhans cells and 2) immunoglobulins (1). Langerhans cells are mainly found on the outer regions of the cornea. The langerhans cells are used to phagocytose recognized pathogens, and then present the digested fragments to the stroma of the cornea. They may also recognize antibodies or complement factors which have opsonized an antigen, flagging it for phagocytosis. In the case of fungal infections, complement factors will not work because the cell wall protects the cell-membrane of the fungus (1). After digestion, the expressed epitopes can be recognized by B-cells or T-cells with complementary receptors. This could trigger an immune response which culminates in inflammation of the cornea. Inflammation triggers the recruitment of natural killer cells (NK cells), leukocytes, and other lymphocytes to the site of infection. When the langerhans cells phagocytose an antigen, they mature into dendritic cells by traveling to nearby lymph nodes. They then migrate to the corneal stroma where they can release cytokines or other inflammatory mediators. Cytokines released include IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha (textbook). IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha are all synergistic with each other. They cause the release of acute phase proteins from the liver, and activate T-cells, B-cells, or inflammatory cells. IL-12 functions to activate NK cells and also causes the proliferation of TH1-cells. This will lead to the eventual increased production of IFN-γ. Taken together, a cell-mediated response seems to be highly favored.

The second defense consists of the immunoglobulins concentrated in the corneal stroma which have been secreted by plasma B-cells. On the surface of the cornea is a layer of mucous glycoprotein in association with glycocalyx, a network of polysaccharides (1). Immunoglobulin A (IgA), a major class of antibodies associated with serum and bodily secretions, is linked with these layers of mucous glycoproteins. IgA is essential as part of the defense against specific fungus antigens. Immunoglobulins not only attach to the surfaces of fungi marking them for extermination, but also neutralize dangerous mycotoxins released by the fungi.

Unique to infections involving Fusarium is the lack of most granulocytes, also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, during inflammation (1). This class of leukocytes includes the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. These cells function to release enzymes or oxygen radicals to destroy foreign antigen. Basophils and eosinophils secrete Type II cytokines (IL-4 or IL-5 respectively) and tend to stimulate humoral responses within the body (textbook). Thus, it makes sense that there is an absence of humoral-mediated responses in the body. It has been suggested that these leukocytes are kept away from the eye as a defense mechanism to prevent hazardous inflammation which could damage the eye.

The primary method of dealing with fungal infections happens to be cell-mediated. Neutrophils and monocytes are very effective against the hyphae of Fusarium (1). These cells migrate to sites of infection, and use reactive oxygen species or enzymes to kill ingested organisms. They are attracted to the sites of infection by the Type I cytokines, IFN-γ and G-CSF, which are secreted by TH1-cells or NK cells and fibroblasts or monocytes respectively (1). These two cytokines greatly enhance the functioning of the neutrophils and monocytes in the eye. Monocytes can also secrete IL-1 to stimulate T-cell activation and promote B-cell clonal expansion and maturation.

The important area needed for all of these responses can be found within the protective epithelium of the conjunctiva, the membrane covering the sclera and lining the inside of eyelids (12). The conjunctiva is likely to become inflamed during infection. Lymphoid tissue can be found in this area, and houses the colonies of B-cells and T-cells. B-cells here undergo maturation after being exposed to antigen presented by langerhans cells. The B-cells then migrate to nearby lymph nodes to proliferate into plasma cells. The mature cells then return to the conjunctiva or go to the blood marrow to produce antibodies. If in the eye, IgA will be secreted (4). T-cells are also stimulated by the antigen presented by langerhans cells or B-cells (via MHC II). Helper T-cells similarly migrate nearby lymph nodes to mature, and then return to the conjunctiva in order to release cytokines to activate leukocytes or provide co-stimulation for the functioning of other lymphocytes.

Progression of Disease
The majority of fungal keratitis occurs after trauma to the cornea. The early symptoms of fungal keratitis are blurred vision, a red and painful eye that does not improve when contact lenses are removed, increased sensitivity to light, and excessive tearing or discharge (11). Fungal keratitis is recognizable by the presence of a coarse granular infiltration of the corneal epithelium and the anterior stroma. The corneal defect usually becomes apparent within 24 to 36 h after the trauma. There is minimal to absent host cellular infiltration. The absence of inflammatory cells is likely a good prognostic finding, since products of polymorphonuclear leukocytes contribute to the destruction of the cornea. It has been contended that eyelid lesions are common in patients with eye infections.

The eye will appear white with filamentous projections from the cornea after about a week. Fusarium Keratitis may completely destroy an eye within a few weeks and malignant glaucoma can ensue. If not treated after 5or 6 weeks, blindness may result. A systemic infection is unlikely. If the fungus does get past the eye's defense system and into other tissues, it will be exposed to all of the immune defenses of the body. This includes inflammatory macrophages, granulocytes, and humoral immunity. However, this can lead to inflammation of the tissue surrounding the eye. The eye will appear severely red and tearing will ensue to lower the pH of the eye and introduce lysozyme to the fungus.

Therapy
Fungal and human cells have similar mechanisms for DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. This greatly limits the number of potential antifungal drug targets because the vast majority of compounds that inhibit fungi also are toxic to human cells. Therefore, antifungal drugs tend to target the few features of fungal cells that differ from human cells. Most fungal cell membranes contain ergosterol, rather than cholesterol, which is the sterol found in human cell membranes. Amphotericin B directly binds to ergosterol, whereas the azoles (e.g., itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) and terbinafine target ergosterol synthesis (4). However, the major distinguishing feature of fungal cells is a rigid cell wall containing chitin, mannans and glucans (the target of the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs).

Fluconazole is an oral anti-fungal medication known to be effective in curing numerous types of fungal infections throughout the body. It functions to block the pathway for sterol synthesis in Fungi (3). Clinical trials have shown that it is able to fight fungal eye infections like Fusarium keratitis. The active ingredient is 2,4-difluoro-α,α1-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) benzyl alcohol. Fluconazole is sold under the name Diflucan, made by Pfizer. One dose is 100mg, and 30 pills costs $434.98. Two pills are taken daily for two weeks, or until symptoms cease to exist.

Natamycin is highly effective at fighting fungal Keratitus. Natamycin is a tetraene polyene antibiotic derived from Streptomyces natalensis. The mechanism of action appears to be through binding of the molecule to the sterol moiety of the fungal cell membrane. The polyenesterol complex alters the permeability of the membrane to produce depletion of essential cellular constituents. The active ingredient is a stereoisomer of 22-[(3-amino-3, 6-dideoxy-(beta)-D- mannopyranosyl)oxy]-1,3,26-trihydroxy-12-methyl-10-oxo-6,11,28-trioxatricyclo[22.3.1.0 5,7 ] octacosa-8,14,16,18,20-pentaene-25-carboxylic acid (3). The manufacturer is Alcon, and sold under the name Natacyn. A 15mL bottle costs $220. Natacyn is administered is through the use of eyedrops. The user usually takes one eyedrop every 4 to 6 hours, though more serious infections may require a higher dose.

Due to the economic restraints held by some of the sufferers of the Fusarium Keratitis infection, our outlook would be that an alternative more affordable means of therapy should also be looked at as a potential cure. We recommend the product Melaleuca Alternifolia or more commonly known as tea tree oil. It has already been proven through laboratory research to be an effective substitute from conventional medicine in treating fungal infections of the mouth and foot (8). The active ingredients involved in tea tree oil are Terpinen-4-ol and Cineole (8). It is mainly produced in Australia and marketed in the United States by the company Desert Essence. They sell their product for the price of $19.99 for every 2 fluid ounces (7). We propose that the initiative be taken to enhance the product into a form suitable for application to the eye (i.e. eye drops). As of now only a topical solution is available which is both used in the diluted form for gargling in the mouth, and as a direct applicant to the skin. Eye drop usage once every 4-6 hours as has been shown to be effective with Natacyn may be sufficient, but if results did not show then an increase in the frequency of application could be imposed.

Other Possible Causes
The ReNu MoisturLoc product may have been sterile when it left the plant in Greenville. However, the ingredients in MoisturLoc are different from the other formulas made by Bausch. It is important to note that only ReNU MoisturLoc is related to the greater chance of developing the Fusarium Keratitus infection. One reason this could be possible is because the MoisturLoc provides an environment where the Fusarium can thrive and reproduce in. The MoisturLoc may be a sort of minimal essential media for the fungus. It is already known that the Fusarium did not come from the factory. However, when the user puts the MoisturLoc in the contact cases, Fusarium is able to grow on the lens. The method by which Fusarium gets access to the solution is unknown, but since spores can be airborne it is possible for the fungus to randomly land in the solution. In this case, the probability of contaminating the solution depends on the user; if the user keeps the solution near outdoor areas or other places with spores, then the likelihood of contamination increases. After the user puts the infected contacts in their eyes, the fungus on the lens will come into contact with the eye. The fungus is then trapped between the eye and contact lens for the entire day which gives the Fusarium enough time to get through the cornea and reproduce in the eye, causing infection.

Another possible reason that the ReNu MoistureLoc may be causing infection is because a chemical in MoistureLoc may be causing the defense system of the eye to malfunction. An ingredient in the solution may be acting as an inhibitor of a defense mechanism. Normally the eye may come into contact with Fusarium on a daily or weekly basis. The lymphoid tissue of the conjunctiva is usually able to fight off the infection under normal conditions. However, when a patient who uses contacts with MoisturLoc comes into contact with the eye, perhaps the conjunctiva lymphoid tissue is no longer able to fight off the disease. This may be because the MoisturLoc is inhibiting cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, or TNF-a) that normally promote defensive cells to attack the fungus. In this way, a Fusarium Keratitis infection would proceed easier.",0,0,35.51,18.3,14269
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Plant Biodiversity,"I. What is biodiversity?
Biodiversity can be simply defined as the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. (Wikipedia, Biodiversity) This definition encompasses all organisms, from complex eukaryotic plants to simple unicellular bacteria, found in a particular geographical area or habitat. When discussing the biodiversity of an area, ecologists often attempt to quantify the amount of biodiversity present in one particular area using one of several indices. From these indices, it has been shown that biodiversity is not evenly distributed throughout the world. For instance, biodiversity is much higher in tropical regions, where there is the highest number of endemic, or native, species. In contrast to the tropics, polar regions, such as Antarctica, have much fewer species present, and therefore contain a lower amount of biodiversity.

Since biodiversity is not constant throughout the Earth, one may wonder what factors influence the amount of biodiversity in a region. However, this question has been the topic of debate among many scientists. Scientists have begun to argue against the prevailing theory that geographical isolation via climate change is the one factor that impacts biodiversity the most. Instead, researchers have recently found that the variable evolutionary rate of species is one of top determining factors of biodiversity. (Butler 2005) Because of the increasing loss of biodiversity in biomes around the world, ecologists have also outlined the factors that have led to this decrease in biodiversity. One of the main influences is the presence of human activity, such as deforestation, overpopulation, and pollution.

II. Diversity within the Family Moraceae, Genera Ficus and Dorstenia
The increase in biodiversity within a region usually requires the formation of mechanisms to adapt to a specialized habitat, such as tropical rainforests. Because of this, many plant families are found in one specific biome. However, there are a few instances in which a plant family has species that inhabit more than one biome. One such example is the Moraceae family, a diverse group comprising approximately 40 genera and 1,000 species. Species from this family are characterized by a milky sap and may be either monoecious, having both male and female flowers on the same plant, or dioecious, having male and female flowers on the separate plants of the same species. The Moraceae flowers are generally small and densely aggregated on the plant. (Burns, Honkala, Glossary) (Carr, Moraceae) The species in this family are known for their economic importance as fruit producers; significant products include figs, mulberries, breadfruit, and jackfruit. (Watson, Dallwitz, Moraceae Link) While the majority of species in this family are found in tropical biomes, a few species are indigenous to temperate biomes.

Tropical biomes are characterized by a non-arid climate whose average temperatures remain above 18°C year-round. Tropical biomes include rain forests, monsoon climates, and wet or dry savanna habitats. The tropics are also sometimes referred to as aseasonal, meaning that they do not have great differences in average monthly temperatures or amount of daylight hours throughout the year. Areas that are known for having a tropical climate include Central and South America, Hawaii, and many south Asian countries, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. (Wikipedia, Köppen climate classification)

Temperate biomes, on the other hand, include a broader range of climates. These mesothermal biomes are characterized by average temperatures above 10°C during warm months and average temperatures between 0°C and 18°C during cold months. There is no typical average yearly rainfall for temperate biomes; amount of precipitation can be anywhere from dry winters to dry summers to significant precipitation during all seasons. Compared to tropical biomes, temperate biomes are distinct in that they have definite seasons; for instance, there are generally large differences in average monthly temperatures throughout the year. Because this category is so expansive, habitats such as Mediterranean, Humid Subtropical, Maritime Temperate, and Maritime Subarctic are all included under the definition of temperate biome. (Wikipedia, Köppen climate classification)

A tropical representative species of the Moraceae family is Dorstenia gigas. This particular species has large succulent leaves and a fleshy receptacle containing flowers attached to a thick stem. (Carr, Moraceae) It is endemic to the Socotra Islands, near the coast of Yemen in the Indian Ocean, and requires a minimal average temperature of about 55°C for growth. This species is not self-fertile, and thus requires two plants, a male and female, to produce seeds. One distinguishing feature of this species is its pollination mechanism. Once seeds become ripe, pressure builds and the seed pod explode, expelling the seeds. Seeds ripen year round. (Faucon, Dorstenia gigas) Since its habitat is generally a dry savanna habitat, the succulent, fleshy leaves serve the purpose of water storage for the plant. However, the leaves of Dorstenia gigas are not as succulent as those of desert biome cacti, to whom water retention and hydration is much more important.

In contrast, Ficus carica , commonly known as the fig tree, is an example of a Moraceae species that is found in temperate biomes. Characteristics for this particular species include growth into shrub or low-spreading deciduous tree forms and large non-succulent lobed deciduous leaves attached to medium stems and trunks, in contrast to the thick pachycaulous trunks of Dorstenia gigas . This species can grow in temperatures down to -12°C, and can thus tolerate the frost of some temperate climates. (Faucon, Fig (Ficus carica)) The fig tree also has a noteworthy mechanism of reproduction and pollination. Unlike Dorstenia, Ficus is self-fertilizing and depends on the use wasps to transfer pollen from a kind of Ficus flower called a caprifig (one which does not lead to a fig fruit) to a non-pollen-producing flower that leads to an edible fig. (Faucon, Fig (Ficus carica)) Given that temperate biomes have distinct seasons, Ficus carica trees produce fruit and flowers during the warm summer months. Also as a result of its temperate habitat, Ficus carica is dormant during the cold winter months, and often resprouts from its roots, so that it may produce fruit in the summer. (Christman, Ficus carica)

III. Conclusion and Future Directions
As can be seen, a range of biodiversity can be found around the world and is dependent of several factors. Since plants are often specially adapted for their specific biomes, it is not common to find a plant family that includes member species in more then one biome. However, the Moraceae family is an example of this; the genus Ficus includes a species that inhabits the temperate zone, while the genus Dorstenia is found only in tropical climates. Given that these species of the Moraceae family have thrived in their respective biomes for a significant amount of time, one can surmise that the species will be maintained in the future, as long as their environments do not drastically change. Finally, it is also likely that plant species of other families will follow the example of Moraceae. In the future, genera and species of a single family may become more diverse and occupy several biomes as they adopt specific structures that allow them to adapt to varied climates.",89.39,78.87,52.85,41.48,7513
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Malaria Disease and Transmission,"Malaria is the disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium (1). Symptoms of malaria usually resemble the flu; however, in young children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients the disease may lead to eventual death (2). It is the most serious, widespread parasitic disease causing over one million deaths annually. The disease is restricted to tropical and subtropical regions where the insect vectors, Anopheles mosquitoes, are present; this encompasses a thick band of countries surrounding the equator. There are four species of Plasmodium that infect humans, including P. falciparum, vivax, ovale, and malariae.

The life cycle includes two hosts, female Anopheles mosquitoes and humans (1). A human host is inoculated with Plasmodium sporozoites when an infected mosquito takes a human blood meal. The sporozoites of Plasmodium travel in the blood stream to the liver where they infect hepatocytes and mature into schizonts. These schizonts rupture after about six days and release 30,000-40,000 daughter cells called merozoites into the blood stream. Erythrocytes are then invaded by single merozoites. In 48 hours the organism undergoes asexual reproduction and produces 8-24 daughter cells. The red blood cells rupture and the new daughter cells invade more red blood cells. The clinical manifestations of Malaria are caused by the blood stage parasites that destroy large numbers of erythrocytes every two days.

The remaining life cycle stages known as the sporogonic cycle occur after Plasmodium gametocytes are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito. During a 10 - 18 day period ingested macrogametes are penetrated by microgametes to produce zygotes in the stomach of the mosquito. These zygotes penetrate the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts, which rupture to release sporozoites. The sporozoites then travel to the mosquito salivary glands where they can infect a new host.

The Anopheles mosquitoes remain asymptomatic when infected with the parasites; they only serve as vectors. The successful completion of the sporogonic cycle is dependent upon if the inoculated mosquito survives long enough for the Plasmodium to finish the cycle and if weather conditions are appropriate (hot and humid) for Plasmodium development.

State of the Problem
In the early 1950's Malaria was successfully eradicated from the U.S. through the use of DDT, chloroquine, and other anti-malarial medications and insecticides (1, 4). Efforts were made worldwide beginning in 1955 to continue to reduce the malarial burden. In western Europe malaria was declared eradicated in 1975. Due to difficulties with surveillance in developing countries the malaria eradication project was abandoned in 1978.

Malaria is still ever present worldwide with 41% of the global population living in areas where malaria is endemic (1, 2, 4). There are approximately 350 million cases annually, with sub-Saharan Africa being the most heavily impacted. Across all developing countries, malaria is the cause of death for 1 out of every 10 children. Malaria causes a total of over one million deaths annually; 3,000 daily deaths are children's.

Today it is much more challenging to treat and control malaria than it was in the early 20th century. In recent years the evolution of new drug and insecticide resistant strains of Plasmodium and Anopheles respectively have evolved. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that climate changes due to global warming are beginning to increase disease incidence. Population movements cause non-endemic countries to be at constant risk for introduction of malaria.

Control
Protection from malaria can be attained at the human host level or the Anopheles vector level. People living in malaria endemic areas of the world often develop an acquired immunity from continual exposure to the malarial parasite (1). This immunity does not protect them from contracting the Plasmodium but does from the severe clinical manifestations of the disease. Some individuals, typically those from endemic regions, do have an innate immunity against Plasmodium from genetic blood disorders, such as caring one recessive sickle cell gene for abnormal hemoglobin or lacking Duffy receptors on red blood cells so Plasmodium are unable to infect erythrocytes. For individuals without innate or acquired immunity against malaria prophylactic drug therapies are available. These medications do not prevent one from contracting the disease; however, they suppress Plasmodium from maturing inside the host and thus minimize symptoms. The distribution of these medications is often difficult in developing nations.

Control at the vector level attempts to prevent initial malaria infections. The most common and currently most effective method involves the use of insecticide treated bed nets (2). However, distribution and retreatment of these nets has proven challenging and costly (1). Insecticide spraying inside of homes is also effective, although over 125 species of Anopheles have developed resistance against at least one insecticide. Other effective measures include the destruction of larval breeding sites, the development of genetically altered mosquitoes that actually kill the malaria parasites, and the development of vaccines, but all these solutions require costly resources.

Complete control of malaria is not an unrealistic goal for the future because malaria is a treatable and preventable disease. Implementation of successful, sustainable anti-malaria programs including monitoring and intervention will require a concerted effort by local government authorities in conjunction with international government, NGO, private and public sector resources.

Should the U.S. government be involved in controlling the spread of malaria?
From a humanitarian standpoint the United States government should invest resources in controlling the global spread of malaria; however, even with only America's self serving interests in mind international anti-malarial programs should be supported. Even since the successful U.S. eradication in 1951 U.S. citizens remain an at risk population (1). In the U.S. there have been 63 outbreaks of malaria between 1957 and 2003 where locally infected Anopheles mosquitoes acted as vectors. These resident mosquitoes (both A. quadrimaculatus and A. freeborni are common in the United States and capable of acting as vectors for malaria) continue to put Americans at risk for the reintroduction and spread of malaria. In 2002 alone there were 1,337 reported cases of malaria in the States. The vast majority of these cases were acquired outside of the U.S.; although, a small portion of them may have been caused by blood transfusions with Plasmodium infected blood, organ transplants, or congenital transmission.

With global warming altering weather patterns, the percentage of American regions with appropriate climates for the survival and reproduction of Plasmodium will rise, thus increasing the risk for local malaria outbreaks. Moreover, heightened travel and immigration from malaria endemic regions increases the possibility of malaria reintroduction (or even more frightening, the introduction of drug-resistant strains) into the United States.

Recently much progress has been made towards eliminating the burden of Malaria in the less developed nation of Mexico. After the government implementation of an effective monitoring and intervention program there has been a 97% decrease in malarial cases since 1985. Currently few regions of the country, mostly the southern border territories that are difficult to access, are still at risk for malaria outbreaks. This significant progress towards eradication should encourage a continued commitment to fighting malaria globally.

In 1998, the international Roll Back Malaria Partnership was launched with the ambitious goal of halving the global burden of malaria by 2010 (4). There are 86 participating entities from both malarial endemic and non-endemic nations. The partnership states that, … a successful fight against malaria will have far-reaching impact on child mortality, maternal health, and poverty, which in turn may increase global stability. For all of the preceding reasons, amongst numerous others, the United States should concern itself with the treatment and prevention of Malaria worldwide.

Comparative Analysis of the Costs and Benefits of a U.S. International Anti-Malaria Program
There are U.S. government supported international anti-malaria programs already in place. In June of 2005 Mr. Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (1, 3). The goal of the program is to halve malarial deaths in target sub-Saharan African nations within three years of implementation. US$1.2 billion has been pledged for these efforts over the next five years. Eventually 15 of the most affected African nations will be included in the program with the most at risk populations of young children and pregnant women being targeted. It involves supporting local governments so they can provide insecticide-treated nets, indoor insecticide spraying, combination drug therapies, and education to increase the numbers of individuals who seek care. Additionally, the President's Malaria Initiative is working to improve local infrastructure surrounding intervention, encouraging private sector involvement, and closely monitoring its own program to ensure its success and wise use of resources.

Only implementing this program in 15 countries is hardly enough. The President's Malaria Initiative is expected to effect approximately 175 million people, yet there are well over 300 million cases of malaria annually. The total debt to Africa alone from direct (money spent on medical visits, insecticide treated nets, medications, funerals, ect.) and indirect causes (income and productivity lost) is estimated to be US$12 billion dollars annually - the U.S. government is investing only one-tenth of this annual loss over a period of five years (4). More can be done to protect residents of endemic countries. The cost of potentially life saving anti-malarial drug therapies are incredibly inexpensive, ranging from US$0.13 for chloroquine or US$0.14 for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to US$2.68 for a course of quinine (1).

The Roll Back Malaria Partnership estimates that in addition to the current donations and support they receive (of which the President's Malaria Initiative and the U.S. Agency for International Development among other U.S. supported agencies are included) another US$3 billion dollars must be raised annually in order to successfully achieve their goal. US$2 billion is needed in Africa with the remaining US$1 billion required for malaria endemic nations of other continents. It is not the United States' responsibility to supply in full these additional resources. It is feasible for the U.S. government to continue building and strengthening partnerships with both the public and private sector, non-profit and grass-roots organizations (5).

There are social issues inhibiting the success of anti-malaria programs including poverty, civil unrest, war, food shortages, and other complex emergencies that face malaria endemic countries (4). These social problems drastically inhibit adequate treatment and surveillance systems that must be in place to truly combat malaria (1). Education about malaria and its global impact should be presented to those living in developed nations who may be willing to help. One person can save a life in Africa with a US$10 donation.

Impoverished families living in malaria endemic regions may spend up to 25% of their annual income on prevention and treatment of the disease (4). The reduction of the malarial burden will promote a more stable and productive global market (5). This will set the stage for increased economic development in current malaria endemic nations and for an increased quality of life for their citizens.

Currently the U.S. supports numerous programs committed to fighting public health crises across the globe. Combating infections such as HIV/AIDS and the possible pandemic flu outbreak will have similar positive results to fighting malaria. It is difficult to balance available U.S. resources among all of these quality disease control and prevention programs.

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has allotted US$15 billion, for a five year period which began in 2003, to combat the disease in over 120 countries (5). This is a far more extensive endeavor than the President's Malaria Initiative. AIDS affects more individuals worldwide than Malaria, an estimated 40 million are living with HIV. Today over one million American's harbor the AIDS virus, and it is estimated that 40,000 new infections occur annually within the United States. The rate of incidence rises drastically in less developed nations. For these reasons HIV/AIDS programs should be of higher priority and receive more U.S. government funding than anti-malarial programs.

The President's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response was outlined in late 2005 to help plan a course of action for when the United States, and the world, is faced with a pandemic flu outbreak. Such an outbreak is foreseeable in the near future (from the H5N1 avian flu virus) and may have devastating impacts worldwide if proper precautionary measures are not taken. The last three flu pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968; they killed 40 million, 2 million and 1 million people respectively. The program's budget of US$7.1 billion is to be used for detection of international outbreaks, national accumulation of vaccines and antiviral medications, and to increase national and local governments' readiness to respond to such an outbreak. Again, the funding for this flu pandemic program is greater than that of the anti-malarial program. The potential devastating effects of a pandemic flu outbreak in the United States are vast, but will they be worse than if malaria is reintroduced?

It is not unrealistic that malaria could one day become endemic in the United States. The main risk for reintroduction of the disease is by frequent travelers to, and immigrants from, South and Central American countries (1). Additional resources should be sent to support the prevention and control of disease in these countries. It is possible for money to be reallocated from the pandemic flu program to support anti-malarial programs outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Both flu and malaria programs in relation to the United States are functionally preventative; however, the anti-malaria program would serve to be more beneficial to current people living in malaria endemic regions. A few hundred million dollars should be reallocated from the President's National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response budget to support anti-malaria programs outside of sub-Saharan Africa, focused in the Americas.",81.05,39.37,33.21,35.19,14943
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Role of Leptin in Cardiovascular Disease,"Introduction:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on global health, particularly in developed nations like the United States. CVDs currently afflict more than 70 million Americans.1 In addition, nearly 910,000 Americans die of such diseases every year.1 These diseases cumulatively result in over 6 million hospitalizations yearly and over $403 billion in health care expenditures and lost productivity.1 Thus, the need to develop new treatments to quash CVDs is great. One way to prevent cardiovascular disease is to reduce risk factors leading to onset of the disease. The development of cholesterol-lowering statins and anti-hypertensive angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been important steps toward eradicating CVDs. Though numerous pharmacologic agents exist to reduce risk factors, the identification of novel risk factors and their stimulatory conditions could lead to more effective treatments. Current examinations of critical factors in CVD development often converge on leptin. Worldwide research has recently elucidated the significance of this small molecule in CVD progression through widespread and dynamic mechanisms. A review of current findings on leptin's role in CVD will be at the center of this report.

The Biology of Leptin:
The Hormone:
Leptin is a 16-kDa peptide hormone product of the obese (Ob) gene secreted primarily by white adipocytes (Figure 1).2 This pleiotropic hormone has been shown to impact regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and reproduction in mammals.3 Leptin functions as a hormonal mechanism for sensing fat deposition, whereby greater adipocyte density and size yields more leptin which subsequently curbs apetite and increases energy expenditure.3 Leptin synthesis is under further regulatory control of factors such as glucocorticoids, insulin, and melanin-concentrating hormone.4,5 Research into leptin's role in obesity and energy metabolism ultimately led to the discovery of its importance in cardiovascular disease.

The Receptor:
As a peptide hormone, leptin exerts its physiologic effects through a cell-surface receptor. At least six isoforms of the Ob receptor exist, with only one (Ob-Rb) capable of undergoing a fully functional response to stimulation.6 The Ob receptor is a transmembrane protein sharing structural similarity to gp130 receptors utilized by various cytokines.7 Chemical cross linking studies demonstrated that Ob-Rb homodimerizes following leptin stimulation.8 Once triggered, this complex is capable of activating several intracellular signaling pathways via cytoplasmic box motifs present in the receptor's amino acid structure. Leptin utilizes JAK2 kinase activity to modulate its effects in different pathways including JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K (Figure 2).7,8 These intracellular signal cascades often induce transcription that leads to regulation of the anorexigenic and other effects of leptin.7 Actions mediated by the leptin receptor occur throughout organisms spanning from the CNS to peripheral tissues with Ob-Rb identified in lung, kidney, testis, and skeletal muscle tissue.9 With such widespread receptor distribution, new functions of leptin are being discovered frequently.

Role in Cardiovascular Disease:
Clinical research has demonstrated an association between elevated plasma leptin levels and cardiovascular complications in humans. One such study examined moderately hypercholesterolemic men with no history of myocardial infarction and/or coronary artery disease in an effort to identify new risk factors for CVD.10 This study discovered a statistically significant relationship between the likelihood of a coronary event (defined as myocardial infarction and need for coronary revascularization) and circulating leptin levels. When controlling for prominent risk factors such as age, lipids, and systolic blood pressure, for each 1 SD increase in circulating leptin concentration the relative risk of a cardiovascular event increased by 1.20. This preliminary study suggested a correlation between high leptin levels and cardiovascular disease that warranted further studies into the potential role of leptin in cardiovascular disease.

Experiments conducted at the University of Michigan directly implicated leptin in atherosclerosis and thrombosis.11 In these studies, APOE -/- mice (prone to developing atherosclerotic plaques) were subjected to chronic elevated leptin levels through daily injections of recombinant murine leptin. Following a 4 week injection period, mice were examined to determine total atherosclerotic lesion as well as the time to vessel occlusion as a measure of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherogenesis measurements revealed significantly greater atherosclerotic lesion and aortic intima thickness in mice that received leptin relative to vehicle, corresponding to increased severity of disease. Mice that received leptin treatment also achieved occlusive thrombus due to photochemical injury significantly faster than vehicle. Minimal changes in total cholesterol and triglycerides revealed a potentially direct effect of leptin on disease progression. These experiments clearly implicate leptin in cardiovascular disease development.

A closer examination of the central and peripheral effects of leptin will clarify its observed role in CVD progression.

Hypertension and Tachycardia
Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is diagnosed in humans with a systolic blood pressure of over 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of over 90 mm Hg. Though no perceptible symptoms are usually present, secondary complications of hypertension can be severe. Secondary conditions such as myocardial infarction, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy often occur. A Japanese investigation into the potential role of leptin in development of hypertension revealed a statistically significant correlation between circulating leptin levels and incidence of hypertension.12 The study examined adolescents and excluded individuals with prior metabolic or cardiovascular disorders. After adjustment for age and BMI, researchers found that elevated leptin levels correlated significantly with increased blood pressure in obese individuals. These results suggested a possible role of leptin in hypertension.

The development of transgenic skinny mice that overexpress leptin under the control of a liver-specific promoter provided a new experimental model to examine leptin's role in hypertension without the confounding variable of obesity.13 The power of this model stems from its ability to achieve chronically high leptin levels without high amounts of adipose tissue. Plasma leptin concentrations in the transgenic mice used in the experiment were 60.6 ± 14.4 ng/mL, approximately 10-fold higher than those in nontransgenic littermates (4.8 ± 0.6ng/mL). Tail-cuff systolic BP measurements revealed significantly elevated BP in transgenic skinny mice compared with nontransgenic littermates (120.0 ± 1.6 vs.102.7 ± 2.7 mmHg; n = 12; P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed roughly 3 fold higher epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in urine of transgenic vs. nontransgenic mice with comparable total urine output. This data suggested a leptin-mediated chronic sympathetic activation, which may have led to the observed hypertension in these mice. The investigators tested this theory though a sympathetic blockade of α1-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, or ganglionic blockers. This blockade effectively abrogated the observed hypertension of the skinny mice and had no effect on the blood pressure of nontransgenic mice. This result suggests that the observed leptin-mediated hypertension does rely on sympathetic activation (Figure 3). Additional studies examining the importance of sympathetic activation on leptin-mediated cardiovascular effects through direct IV leptin injections on rats revealed tachycardia as an additional effect of leptin.14 This research group was able to reduce this observed elevated heart rate with an adrenergic blockade that suggested that leptin mediates tachycardia through sympathetic activation as well.

Leptin may also contribute to hypertension through its effects on circulating white blood cells. Flow cytometric analysis of blood samples from healthy human subjects with an anti-leptin receptor mAb showed that 25 +/- 5 % of monocytes, 12 +/- 4% of polymorphonuclear cells, and 5 +/- 1% of lymphocytes express the Ob-R.15 This expression pattern would allow leptin to mediate a robust effect on white blood cells. Researchers observed leptin's ability to stimulate cytokine production through experiments on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).15 Leptin treatments of 50-1000 ng/ml on these cells significantly induced the production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha as observed through flow cytometric measurements. Leptin's ability to stimulate cytokine production may be important to hypertension because several studies have demonstrated that increased levels of these cytokines stimulates hypertension.16 This data demonstrates the dynamic effects of leptin and its ability to affect CVD in multiple ways through indirect effects on different tissues.

Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is the process of accumulating fatty substance, cholesterol, cellular waste, calcium and fibrin on the inner lining of arteries. These vessel-narrowing deposits, called plaques, can be compensated for by artery enlargement, but inevitably lead to plaque ruptures and arterial stenosis. Many factors contribute to atherogenesis including smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, neovascularization, and calcification of vascular cells. Leptin has been shown to play a key role in each of the aforementioned processes involved in atherogenesis.

Arterial intima thickening observed in atherosclerosis has been attributed in part to proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that migrate into the intima of the artery. Leptin has been shown to increase both VSMC proliferation and migration. A study to determine leptin's effects on these processes treated VSMC isolated from rat aorta with several doses of leptin in different assays.17 Researchers observed an approximately 20% increase of maximal cell number in VSMC cultures treated with leptin (100ng/ml) vs. vehicle over a three day time course. A chemotaxis assay that examined the propensity of VSMC to migrate towards a chemoattractant solution of leptin through a microchemotaxis chamber revealed that 3 fold more cells were able to migrate through a polycarbonate membrane following a leptin trail than with no leptin trail. The use of specific inhibitors of PI3K pathway (wortmannin and LY 294002) showed that this pathway was critical for the migratory effect of leptin. Several other reports suggested that leptin mediates proliferation through the MAPK pathway, though it was not explicitly examined in this publication. These results clearly describe leptin's ability to stimulate VSMC proliferation and migration.

Studies have shown neovascularization within atherosclerotic plaque to be critical to plaque formation.21 Neovascularization may act as a gateway for leukocyte entry into sites of chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. Angiogenisis inhibitors were found to inhibit both atherosclerosis and macrophage infiltration into plaques.21 Other complications of angiogenesis occur primarily because arterial walls are normally free of microvessels except in the atherosclerotic plaques where there are dense networks of capillaries known as the vasa vasorum. These fragile vessels can cause hemorrhages that can significantly impair cardiac function. Leptin's ability to stimulate neovascularization was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro by a group of researchers.18 Leptin-infused matrigel was used to plate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS), which were then cultured in serum free media and examined qualitatively four hours after plating. The HUVECs cultured on matrigel containing 100 ng/ml of leptin formed capillary like structures that were not present in control groups plated without leptin. This induced structure corresponds to leptin's ability to promote neovascularization within atherosclerotic plaques. In vivo studies of leptin's effects were achieved through implantation of a pellet composed of hydratable hydrogel and PBS or 125 ng of leptin into a corneal pocket of rat eyes. Examination of these eyes seven days following implantation showed that the leptin pellet promoted substantial new vessel growth within the eye (Figure 4). Exploration into the mechanism of leptin-mediated vascularization revealed an upregulation in VEGF in leptin treated HUVECS. Experiments also revealed increased production of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in response to leptin. VEGF and the MMPs have previously been described as important factors in initiating angiogenesis through tissue remodeling and endothelial cell proliferation. Histological examination of atherosclerotic plaque revealed the presence of OB-Rb, VEGFR-1, and MMP activity. Thus, leptin's ability to upregulate VEGF and MMP is likely responsible for its effects on angiogenesis within atherosclerotic plaques.

Vascular calcification is an actively regulated process involving calcifying vascular cells (CVC) that reside in the arterial walls and undergo osteoblastic differentiation and form hydroxyapatite mineral. This calcification corresponds to severity of atherosclerosis and may play a role in plaque instability. One group of researchers showed leptin's ability to facilitate this calcification in CVC cells.19 Alkaline phosphatase is a marker of osteoblastic differentiation in CVC that mediates the differentiation process and provides phosphate ions for calcium phosphate mineral formation. Treatment of CVC with leptin for 4 days caused a dose dependent 5-10 fold induction of alkaline phosphatase activity as measured by a cell-associated alkaline phosphatase activity assay. This suggests an ability of leptin to prepare these cells for osteoblastic differentiation. In another study, a 45Ca incorporation assay showed leptin's stimulatory effect on calcium uptake into CVC. Taken together, these data suggest a predominant role of leptin in vascular calcification.

Thrombosis
Thrombosis is the formation of a clot within a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Thrombi normally form following injury to the vessel's wall and stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury. Abnormalities in coagulation are also responsible for thrombus formation. Thrombosis is a particularly dangerous CVD because it can lead to ischemia that can severely damage tissue. Thrombi also can detach and enter systemic circulation as an embolus that can obstruct critical vessels near the heart or brain. Leptin's pro-thrombotic effects described previously in this review are likely due to its role in promoting aggregation of platelets. The presence of the Ob-Rb on platelets suggested that it may play a direct role in aggregation. To test this theory investigators studied the effects of leptin on platelet aggregation in vitro.20 Investigators used Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) isolated from murine blood. These isolated platelets were dosed with leptin (100ng/ml) and analyzed for platelet aggregation with a microplate reader at 560-nm wavelength. Higher transmittance corresponded to increased platelet aggregation. Though leptin alone did not have any effect on platelet aggregation, leptin significantly enhanced Adenosine diphosphate- (a known platelet agonist) induced aggregation (transmittance of leptin-treated 34.5% ± 0.6% vs. vehicle-treated 17.9% ± 0.2% ; P < 0.001). To ensure that this was a specific effect of leptin, the investigators examined platelets with a non-functional leptin receptor (db/db). Results of their experiments revealed no leptin enhanced platelet aggregation with db/db cells, and confirmed that it was in fact a leptin receptor mediated action. Overall, these results demonstrate the specific effect of leptin in enhancing platelet aggregation.

Conclusion:
Leptin plays a significant role in many processes related to the development of CVD. Though it appears to be an important factor in disease progression, treatment options related to significantly decreasing leptin levels could be problematic. Since leptin plays a critical role in normal physiologic function, antibody treatments against leptin could be more harmful than beneficial. Significant research must still be performed into testing the viability of leptin as a therapeutic target. One potent way to reduce leptin levels and consequently risk for CVD, however, is to reduce adipose tissue. Thus, research on leptin's role in CVD should act as an impetus towards increasing education regarding proper diet and exercise.",100,57.68,46.03,45.23,16886
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Mammal Diversification,"ABSTRACT:
The advent of molecular clocks has created a rift in the understanding of mammalian emergence and diversification. The fossil record, previously the sole authority on the subject, has long suggested a fairly dormant mammalian lineage all through the Cretaceous period, followed by intense, rapid diversification in the wake of the K/T mass extinction. The use of DNA sequence data to create a molecular clock, however, has initiated a different historical perspective, in which mammal diversification had been ongoing long before the Cenozoic. This clash has paved the way for the emergence of three distinct models of mammalian diversification: the short fuse, the long fuse, and the explosive model. While the short fuse model, which purely reflects the molecular approach, and the explosive model, which purely reflects the fossil record, seem to be mutually exclusive, the long fuse model, which employs both techniques, may hold the key to an acceptable middle ground.

INTRODUCTION:
The transition from reptile to mammal reaches all the way back to the Carboniferous period, over 250 million years ago, with the development of Synapsids. The earliest Synapsids, Pelycosaurs, survived into the Permian period before going extinct. A more mammal-like offshoot of Pelycosaurs, Therapcids, took hold approximately around the time of this extinction. Kemp (2006) argues that the subsequent diversification of Therapcids may have arisen through the disappearance of their relatives, the Pelycosaurs, via the mechanism of incumbent replacement. As Kemp notes, the replacement of Pelycosaurs by Therapcids was a milestone in mammalian evolution because it marked the first metabolic progression from ectotherm toward endotherm: It was the ancestral Therapsid that had crossed the biological threshold on the road that led ultimately to the metabolically more active, versatile and potentially much more adaptable kind of terrestrial organisms represented by the mammals. The Therapcids, however, suffered a severe reduction during the end-Permian extinction. Cynodonts, considered the final link between reptiles and true mammals, were one of the few Therapcid taxa that survived.

The presence of these distinct mammalian predecessors, tracing all the way back to the end of the Paleozoic period, provides firm evidence that mammalian development was well underway prior to the K/T extinction. However, it must be noted that while the early divergence of this Synapsid lineage certainly lends insight into mammalian evolution, these ancestors were not mammals themselves. Whether or not true mammals actually originated and diversified long before the K/T boundary is a much stickier matter, and touches on the heart of the controversy currently surrounding mammal diversification.

Classical thought had long held that mammalian diversification, by and large, did not occur until directly after the K/T extinction. This theory largely reflected the fossil record, which until recently, was the only available means for assessing phylogenic timeframes. Recently, however, the advent of the molecular clock has provided a new method for piecing together the timeframe for mammalian diversification. These two approaches, however, do not always yield the same view of history. The resulting discrepancy has produced three distinct models of mammalian diversification: the short fuse, the long fuse, and the explosive models. The explosive model largely reflects paleontological evidence, whereas the short fuse model mainly considers molecular data. The long fuse model, in contrast, attempts to reconcile these two extremes.

DISCUSSION:
Short Fuse Model:
The short fuse model, which is characterized by extensive interordinal and intraordinal diversification prior to the K/T extinction, challenges the previously held belief that mammal diversification did not take off until the extinction of the dinosaurs, when adaptive radiation allowed the mammalian lineages to fill into the newly-opened niches. The evidence for this new interpretation comes from a modern innovation: the molecular clock. By comparing the DNA sequences of different taxa, and plugging in a given mutation (calibration) rate, it can be estimated how long ago the taxa split. Under this molecular assessment, mammals arose surprisingly early in the Mesozoic period, perhaps even 150 million years ago, as described by Bromham et al (1999). This early origin has surprised many researchers because there is a lack of evidence in the fossil record to support it. However, Bromham notes that this may simply be a result of the biogeography of mammalian origin: it is hypothesized that mammals first evolved in what is currently Africa, a region with a particularly poor fossil record during the late Cretaceous period.

The credibility of the short fuse model, which relies almost entirely on DNA sequence data, is often called into question, even by its proponents (Bromham 1999), because of certain assumptions inherent in the molecular clock. Most notably, the molecular clock assumes that mutation rates remain constant, both through time and among different taxa. However, this assumption is contradicted by evidence that rate variability does occur. Studies of hominid and rodent mutation rates demonstrate that mutation rates among different taxa may be profoundly different: Li et al (1996) report that the rate of nucleotide substitution is at least two times higher in rodents than in higher primates. This finding is particularly relevant since both of the taxa examined in this experiment, rodents and hominids, are mammals.

The acknowledgement of this rate variation prevents the molecular clock from generating phylogenies with any great degree of precision. The short fuse model, through association, is ultimately tied to this shortcoming in the molecular clock. As a result, the historical view of mammalian diversification presented by the short fuse model often contains broad confidence intervals. Nonetheless, even at the most recent possible predicted divergences, the short fuse model supports several mammalian diversifications well before the K/T boundary.

Figure 2: Estimation of mammal diversification according to molecular data. The confidence bars are represented as grey rectangles. (Bromham, 1999)

Figure here
Explosive Model:
The explosive model, consistent with the classical understanding of mammal diversification, predicts only limited diversification prior to the K/T boundary. As its name implies, the dormant mammal lineage would have then experienced an explosion of diversification directly following the mass extinctions, presumably due to release from predators and competitors. This notion is consistent with the historically widespread pattern of extinction followed by diversification. The model is founded on the fossil record, which, as Futuyma (2005) observes, is thin up until the Cenozoic. Almost all mammalian fossils that can be assigned to modern orders, he explains, occur after the K/T boundary.

In the wake of DNA sequence data, some previous advocates of the explosive model have been led to reconsider their stance, while others have simply made adjustments. In one such example, John Alroy (1999), while admitting that molecular analyses give evidence of interordinal mammalian divergences before the K/T boundary, maintains that these rare occurrences do not deconstruct the argument that there was an explosion of diversification directly afterwards. To defend this point, he cites the increase in mammal body size that occurred in conjunction with the diversification directly after the extinctions. This rapid and permanent shift in body size, he holds, can only be explained by the adaptive radiation of mammals into the niches for large body size that had previously been the domain of dinosaurs. The explosive model has come under fire for its sole adherence to and dependence on the fossil record, but Alroy's argument is one which proponents of the molecular clock cannot ignore.

Long Fuse Model:
In response to the mutual exclusiveness of the short fuse and explosive models, the long fuse model attempts to integrate the two extremes. Under the long fuse model, substantial interordinal splitting occurred in the Cretaceous period, before the K/T boundary, but much of the finer, intraordinal diversification occurred later, in the midst of the K/T boundary and the mass extinctions that it marks. Likewise, the long fuse model attempts to reconcile and utilize data from both the fossil record and DNA sequencing.

A prime example of this integrative approach is documented in a recent article by Springer et al (2003). Focusing on plancental mammals, they conducted a molecular analysis on twenty-two gene sequences. Wary of the pitfalls of the molecular clock, their analysis used the Thorne/Kishino method, which improves the molecular analysis in two important ways. First, it takes into account the constraints of the fossil record, and second, it removes the demand for equal mutation rates among each phylogenic branch. The study also incorporated a Bayesian component (Kelly). Upon completing this integrated analysis, Springer's results express the very definition of the long fuse model: Analyses…all support interordinal divergences in the Cretaceous followed by intraordinal diversification mostly after the K/T boundary.

The hope that the long fuse model will be able to reconcile the molecular clock and the fossil record is quite promising. Preliminary studies, such as the one conducted by Springer et al, have yielded results that are fairly consistent with both seemingly opposed views of history. However, the long fuse model cannot suffice alone. Equally important, dialogue between paleontologists and molecular biologists must be encouraged. Efforts to promote this interaction, such as the conference arranged by Chrisopher Brochu (2004), have already begun, and must continue. Only this dialogue can allow the two schools of thought to take steps in unison toward the common goal, a mutually documented and accepted view on mammal diversification.",0,28.34,19.72,9.92,10250

Malaria is a parasitic protozoa that produces bloodstream infections in its hosts. Four different malarial species infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. The species vary in virulence, with P. falciparum being the most virulent and causing the most mortality4.

Plasmodium infection often causes cycles of fevers and chills as well as anemia. Other symptoms of infection include headaches, nausea and vomiting, fever, enlarged spleen, and liver enlargement. Without treatment, Plasmodium infection can lead to severe disease (cardiovascular shock, pulmonary edema, acute kidney failure, etc) and death4.

Malaria is transmitted person to person through an insect vector, the female Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium exhibits a complex life-cycle that occurs between its human host and its Anopheles vector:

The human host's bloodstream is infected with malarial sporozites from the Anopheles salivary glands after being bitten by the mosquito. For 8-14 days the sporozites multiply in the liver; they are then released to the blood and the host's erythrocytes. The organism continues to divide and mature within the blood cells, eventually bursting the cell and releasing many merozoites to infect new red blood cells. However, some merozoites in the blood go into a phase of sexual reproduction (gametocytes) and do not enter the erythrocytes-these gametocytes are taken up by biting mosquitoes. Plasmodium completes its sexual reproduction in the mosquito and sporozites collect in the salivary glands of the mosquito, ready to infect another host.

The geographic distribution of Malaria, particularly P. falciparum, centers in warm regions near the equator. Transmission can not occur at high altitudes or in cool temperatures, or in regions without the Anopheles vector. Transmission patterns will vary with temperature ( Plasmodium lifecycle inside the vector depends on it), rainfall (for Anopheles breeding), and species of both Plasmodium and Anopheles . Currently, Sub-Saharan Africa suffers the most from Malaria.

II. The State of the Problem
Malaria causes the greatest harm to the greatest number of all infectious diseases4. It is estimated that 300-500 million individuals are infected annually, causing over one million deaths2. These deaths most heavily affect children in Sub-Saharan Africa2.

Now seen as a tropical disease, Malaria was once endemic in many temperate regions such as the United States. However, in the 1950's a Global Malaria Eradication Campaign was started, and it effectively rid the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Taiwan of Malaria. It also reduced the amount of malarial disease in Latin America, southern Africa, and the Middle East 5. Unfortunately, most of tropical Africa was ign ignored during these eradication efforts, and Ma malaria continued to be a major health threat.

There is now a resurgence of Malaria in many countries where it was once controlled, and increasing severity of disease in regions where it remained endemic throughout the century 2. This resurgence is due to a globalized community where there is increased travel and of individuals without immunity to endemic regions. It is also caused by once rural populations' migration to urban regions, where a dense human population is prime for vector transmission of the disease.

The most troubling cause of Malaria's resurgence and increase urgency is that many inexpensive and widely used treatments for the disease are no longer effective-Plasmodium has developed resistance. The new drug therapies for Malaria are up to 20 times more expensive than traditional treatments 5, and most endemic countries can not afford them. Infections which were once treatable are becoming more and more the cause of severe disease and death.

III. Control of Malaria
Complete control and eradication of Malaria is highly unlikely now or in the future. A global eradication would need the help of a vaccine, but the infectious form of plasmodium exhibits antigenic variation, so a stock vaccine would be very difficult to develop 6.

However, even in the absence of vaccine, measures can be taken to effectively control Malaria and reduce morbidity and mortality.

Drugs may be used on the infectious agent, Plasmodium. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing morbidity from infection. Chloroquine is the traditional choice, but now many strains of Plasmodium are resistant. Due to resistance, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is now available to effectively treat Malaria infections, but ACT is much more expensive than Chloroquine 5.

There are many insecticide treatments available to prevent transmission of Malaria. ITN or insecticide-treated bed nets are effective at preventing the vector from transmitting disease, and the insecticide also kills vectors that land on them. IRS/indoor residual spraying of insecticides can also be used with similar results. Larviciding is the application of insecticides to vector breeding sites, but there is difficulty with finding the breeding sites and it requires frequent application 6.

Beyond these measures, governments, hospitals, and community infrastructure must be strong enough to educate about and carry out preventative measures and treatments.

IV. Should the U.S. government be involved in controlling the spread of Malaria?
The U.S. should absolutely be involved in controlling the spread of Malaria. Malaria is unprecedented in its numbers, both that of infections and deaths. It is also unlike any other disease in that it lays a heavy social and economic burden on the communities and countries it ravages.

As stated before, Malaria infects 300-500 million people annually and causes 1.1-2.7 million deaths 5. Tropical Africa accounts for 90% of this burden 5. For comparison, the terrorist attacks on 9/11 caused 2,752 deaths10. Using the lowest estimate of malarial deaths/year, Malaria kills 400 times as many people every year-more deaths than having one 9/11 every single day.

In addition to deaths, Malaria causes a multitude of complications and disease to those who do not die from infection: seizures, coma, severe anemia, pulmonary edema, thrombocytopenia, cardiovascular collapse, shock, acute kidney failure, and hypoglycemia4.

It is this very heavy public health burden of human suffering that provides the first impetus for countries like the US to help. Malaria is a controllable disease that costs relatively little to cure when speaking in westernized terms. Unfortunately, the most malaria-endemic countries are also the world's poorest countries2. Without aid, these countries cannot purchase ACT or provide ITNs to treat and prevent Malaria.

Because these malarious countries tend to be so much lower in economic strength, they cannot effectively treat and prevent the disease. Unfortunately, the disease itself is a cause of economic distress. This is the second reason the US should be involved in Malaria control. The GDP of malarious countries grows 1.3% less every year than non-endemic countries2, and their per-capita GDP's were 1/5 those of non-endemic countries 2. Over 35 years this has led to a $100 billion dollar deficit in the GDP of Sub-Saharan African countries 8.

Malaria is also very detrimental to business in endemic countries. Malaria causes absenteeism from work, decrease in productivity, and decreased morale of workers. Many investors may steer away from endemic areas, and people in endemic countries themselves are less likely to invest in general when life expectancy is shorter 3.

It is difficult for families in endemic areas to succeed economically and be able to have purchasing power. Because the risk of disease is so high, many farmers favor subsistence crops over cash crops because cash crops are more laborious and too risky if someone in the family falls ill 3.

The disease has a large impact on the social demographic of endemic countries. With more children dying from malaria, families will tend to have more children, decreasing the amount of resources spent on each child and increasing the amount of time the woman spends at home taking care of children, giving little reason to invest in women's education and decreasing the amount of years a woman can be economically productive in society.

Because Malaria causes so much human suffering, and because it has such a harmful effect on the economies of endemic countries, the United States should continue to be involved in Malaria Control. Adequate aid for just a few years can resolve many problems associated with malarial disease and transmission, and create stronger economies in these countries to keep their citizens healthy enough to perpetuate the strong economy. For instance, in some endemic countries, 40% of health spending is on Malaria 7. These countries have very poor health services and infrastructures-if the US aids in Malaria relief, those funds can be diverted towards strengthening the health systems, which will be able to adequately handle future malarial episodes.

I propose that the U.S. help fund a Malarial intervention program that involves treatment with prevention methods, centered in Sub-Saharan Africa where Malaria causes the most suffering. The program would include global subsidies for the following: ITNs for all children, preventative treatments for pregnant women (who are especially susceptible to malaria), changing treatments from chloroquine to ACT, and scaling up protocols and hospital stocks from chloroquine to ACT. For Sub-Saharan Africa, this plan costs 824 million dollars annually 5. The U.S., in conjunction with other economic powerhouses and the World Bank, would fund this program for a minimum of 5 years until these countries had a significant decrease in prevalence of Malaria and a strengthened economy/health system infrastructure.

V. Cost/Benefit and Comparative Analysis of a U.S. International Anti-Malaria Program
At the most recent G8 summit, leaders of the world agreed to forgive nearly 40 billion dollars of debt to the world's poorest countries. Most of these countries are African, and most of these African countries are endemic with Malaria. Had Malaria been controlled in these regions 35 years ago, the GDP of these countries would be approximately $100 billion dollars greater-it is probable this debt would never have existed.

Spending money on Malaria control now will undoubtedly save money on foreign aid in the future. Besides reducing the need for foreign aid, controlling Malaria will have positive effects on the countries' economies. After successful malaria control programs, Spain, Italy, and Jamaica all experienced economic growth 3. In a world that is increasingly globalized, their success will translate into economic possibilities for businesses all over the world. For example, Exxon Mobile funded its own anti-malaria program in Africa, and it reported 9.8 million dollars in productivity gains after program implementation 3.

With Malaria controlled, tourist industries in Africa can develop and thrive. Better economies will increase household spending or purchasing power, and businesses that produce consumer goods will profit and be able to exist in countries that were formerly too poor or too risky to operate in.

Every year, Malaria kills at least 400 times the amount of people that terrorist attacks on 9/11 did. The lives lost on 9/11 were the foundation for public support of the Iraqi war-Americans saw the war as a preventative measure against future terrorist attacks. While it is likely the reasons for war in Iraq are a more complex web of economic and political factors, the U.S. is currently spending 2 billion dollars/week 11. A significant contribution to the malarial control program by the U.S. would cost less than .2% of annual spending on the war.

Even if the U.S. were to foot the bill for the entire malarial control program in Sub-Saharan Africa ($824 million annually), malaria control would cost 1/6 of the amount the United States spends annually on funding for cancer-research 9. While cancer research is important and will save many lives in the future, malaria control can save millions of lives right now. It can also help bring impoverished countries out of debt and help them become participants in a strong global economy, and provide trade and investment opportunities for American businesses. It is a win-win situation-saving millions of lives, helping impoverished countries climb out of economic ruts, and increasing U.S. and business opportunities for trade and investment abroad. For the comparatively low cost, Malaria Control is a good cause that the U.S. will benefit from in the future-it is not so much foreign aid as it is an empathetic yet smart investment.",84.26,40.51,19.3,22.74,12812
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,A Case for a US International Anti-Malaria Program,"I. Malaria Disease and Transmission
Malaria is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite. The symptoms of malaria include flu-like symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, muscle pain, diarrhea, and in some instances anemia, and hemoglobinuria. In severe cases of malaria, coma or death may occur, in addition to multi organ failure. Symptoms oftentimes follow a cyclic pattern, recurring as the disease progresses.

There are several different species that are pathogenic (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae) but the two most common are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Malaria is spread by the simultaneous infection of humans and female Anopheles mosquitoes. Inside infected humans, malaria replicates within red blood cells. Then, when a female Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal, the parasite is transferred to the new host where it replicates but does not cause disease. In the female Anopheles mosquito the parasite causes a persistent non-cytopathic infection, whereas in the human it causes an acute cytopathic infection. The parasite can then be transferred to a new human host when the mosquito takes another blood meal. The female Anopheles mosquito acts as a vector in the transmission of the disease. The disease is not transmissible from human to human through simple contact.1

The disease has the highest morbidity and mortality rates among individuals under the age of 5 and among pregnant women. Malaria in pregnant women leads to low birth weight, which in turn leads to numerous other medical problems, some of which are attributable to a lack of expertise in neonatal care in developing countries where malaria is endemic.

II. The State of the Problem
Each year there are approximately 300-500 million occurrences of malaria worldwide. Additionally, approximately one million individuals die from malaria each year worldwide. The majority of the cases of malaria occur in areas of the world that are underdeveloped and contain a warm moist climate.

In the United States there are approximately 1300 cases of malaria annually. It is known that the majority of cases that occur each year in the United States are due to travelers returning from endemic areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa. The death rate in the United States is significantly lower than the rate worldwide due to extensive health care availability compared to underdeveloped countries throughout the world.

Malaria has been a known disease for over 4000 years, afflicting peoples across the world. There is a strong history of combating the disease as well. In 1933 Franklin Roosevelt authorized the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which among other things created a precedent for the funding of an anti-malaria program in the United States. Additionally in 1947 the United States Congress created the National Malaria Eradication Program and was successful in essentially eradicating the disease across the United States in only four years. Worldwide efforts have proven to be successful in some areas, while in others showing negligible success. The lack of total eradication worldwide, according to some experts, can be attributed to, the emergence of drug resistance, widespread resistance to available insecticides, wars and massive population movements, difficulties in obtaining sustained funding from donor countries, and lack of community participation 2. Since 1992 there has been little success in reducing the prevalence of malaria in endemic areas, and some experts agree that if nothing is done to prevent the spread of malaria the death rate could double within the next twenty years3.

III. Control of Malaria
There are several different options for the control of malaria. The two-fold approach includes methods for prevention of the disease and treatment of the disease. Treatment options include a large number of anti-malarial drugs, however the drug of choice until recently had been Chloroquine. Drug resistance has forced healthcare workers in endemic areas to rely on new anti-malarial drugs. The estimated cost of anti-malarial drug treatment for an individual with malaria is less than $3. (see footnote)4

In addition to anti-malarials there are several methods in practice for the prevention of the disease. One significant method developed is the use of insecticide treated bed nets to protect individuals from mosquito bites while asleep in endemic areas. Additionally efforts at eliminating the mosquito population have proven successful in some areas of the world. The gradual elimination of wetlands in the United States and Europe eliminated many of the mosquitoes' breeding grounds, and it is thought this may work in endemic areas as well. Additionally in developed countries the use of insecticides such as DDT has been shown to eliminate the mosquito populations and eradicate malaria.

In many parts of Africa, however, we have seen the development of drug and insecticide resistant strains of the parasite, forcing researchers to look into new ways of combating the disease. While there is not currently a vaccine for malaria, there are several that are being developed. In addition to the growing resistance issues and the lack of a vaccine, a large number of individuals infected with the parasite have no access to healthcare and therefore do not benefit from eradication efforts.

IV. Should the U.S. Government Be Involved in Controlling the Spread of Malaria
The United States in many areas of foreign policy likes to think of itself as the moral leader of the free world. We are actively engaged in pursuits worldwide to liberate peoples under tyrannical rule, eliminate the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and stop the spread of major diseases. Malaria is a major disease worldwide and deserves a significant amount of attention from our Congress. Previous eradication and control programs have ignored the Continent of Africa, where now more than 80% of malaria cases occur5. To stand by idly while millions of young children die from a disease that could have possibly been quelled 40 years ago is disgraceful.

In this area the United States should be the leaders of an International effort to, at the very least, control the spread of malaria, if complete eradication is no longer possible.6 Currently, experts in fields of economics, epidemiology, medicine, and biology are in agreement that unless a significant increase in funding is achieved the effort to prevent the further spread of malaria will not be successful. It has been shown that treatment alone, i.e. the use of anti-malarials after contraction of the disease, is not as effective as prevention and treatment combined.7 Additionally research has shown that preventative measures alone will not suffice in controlling the spread of malaria. Indoor residual spraying, one of the most common preventative measures is impossible to rely on singly for several reasons. First, it is a method that requires agents of the national government physically visit each home once or twice a each year and be allowed to spray an insecticide inside a home by the residents. Even if theses officials are successful however, there is still the risk that residents may cover the freshly sprayed walls with new plaster or paint, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the insecticide. Finally this method may only be effective in endemic areas where it can be used as an immediate remedy.8

There is disagreement over the potential costs of a United States led International effort to fight malaria. Some experts suggest that it would cost roughly one penny for every $10 of income of rich countries 9. Others have done extensive research and have put more precise estimates into the playing field suggesting that 95% coverage using a combination approach consisting of anti-malarials, indoor residual spraying, and insecticide treated bed nets for Africa alone at approximately $1 billion10. This cost, while substantial does not cover all associated costs of implementing an International Anti-Malaria program. Additional funds would need to be allocated to account for funding the healthcare workers, for setting up adequate facilities and for maintaining these facilities. After taking all of these factors into consideration it is feasible to control the spread of malaria worldwide for less than $5 billion. This sum seems large until one considers the amount of money spent on the Iraq war, as of November, over $345 billion and rising by the second11.

V. Cost/Benefit and Comparative Analysis of U.S. International Anti-Malaria Program
Several studies have been done in an attempt to weigh the cost/benefit ratio of a hypothetical anti-malaria program. While different numerical values have been obtained in each study, it seems that each concludes the same thing. The cost/benefit ratio is favorable. Some conservative estimates place the monetary benefits at 2.4 times as high as the costs, while others go as high as 146 times the cost. The possibility of the higher values makes the proposed anti-malaria programs extremely attractive. Even the lower values for the cost-benefit calculations make it competitive with other government programs12.

In determining the cost/benefit ratios researchers looked at several different aspects. One area they looked into was a loss of productivity due to contraction of malaria. One study found that malaria reduced the value of labor productivity by 12%13. An economist reported that persons suffering from malaria miss between 5-20 days of work14. Both of these statistics are staggering. If we were to aid the nations endemic with malaria, we could possibly see an upswing in those nations economies. The benefits of this occurrence could be several fold. First these countries would rely less on foreign aid, as they would be able to fund their own aid programs themselves, both health related and non. Secondly it is possible to think that these new thriving economies could become valuable trade partners with the United States. Finally it is plausible that some of these nations, particularly nations with large Muslim populations, may become strong United States allies, or at the very least no longer be enemies of the United States.

In President Bush's State of the Union address in January 2003, he promised the nation and world that the United States would significantly increase the amount of money that went to fight HIV/AIDS worldwide. President Bush pledged $15 billion to help fight the disease.15 His program termed PEPFAR is one that seeks to help those worldwide afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Given that this program distributes funds in a way that discriminates against programs that are not in line with the moral viewpoint of the President, it would seem more beneficial from a political standpoint to give money to programs associated with a disease that has no connection with sexual intercourse in any way. The president could justify reallocating funds simply on moral grounds if he could find no other justification16.

It is hard to determine which program should take precedence in funding over the other, however a hypothetical example illustrates why an Anti-Malaria program should be funded at this time17 This example illustrates a very crucial point. First of all both HIV/AIDS and malaria are important diseases in the world and deserve attention on an international scale. However, it has been shown that a minimal amount of money per person can be incredibly effective in controlling, treating and possibly eradicating malaria. At this juncture it would seem more practical to focus our attention and funds on a problem that is more manageable. If we ignore the instances of malaria throughout the world we will undoubtedly be faced with a graver challenge in the future when the disease is able to evolve into something more ferocious and difficult to combat.",89.19,84.19,84.74,58.45,11873
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Varying infectivity of Diplostomum flexicaudum in fish species of Douglas Lake,"The metacercarial stage of Diplostomum sp. causes a disease in fish known as diplostomatosis or eye fluke disease (Palmieri et al 1977). This disease shows a negative correlation between parasite abundance and fish condition and has been associated with blindness, cataracts, and in some cases, even death (Marcogliese 1962). In a former study undertaken by Ewing (2004) at the University of Michigan Biological Station, Diplostomum flexicaudum was shown to reduce the survivorship of infected fish, both directly and indirectly. The metacercariae decreased the ability of the fish to recognize a food source and three of the fish exposed to high levels of cercariae died, as compared with no deaths from the control group (Genter 2004, Ewing 2004). The metacercariae in the eyes also affects the fishes' behavior by making them less active and affecting their ability to school, separating them from safety and making them more vulnerable to predators (Fortner 1995). The pathogenic effects of this disease in particular are of great interest because it is so common. Cort (1957) referred to Diplostomum flexicaudum as the most common trematode species in the snails of the Douglas Lake region of northern Michigan.

Diplostomum flexicaudum is a digenetic trematode with a three-host life history (Figure 1). Freshwater fish serve as the secondary intermediate host, harboring the metacercarial stage in the lens of the eye. When infected fish are eaten by the definitive host, most commonly gulls, mergansers, or loons, (Marcogliese et al 2001) the adult fluke will develop in the intestine in less than a week (Davis 1936). When the definitive host defecates, the eggs are transferred to the water via the feces. The miracidia hatch in the water approximately three weeks later, and penetrate various species of aquatic gastropods of the family Lymnaeidae including genera Stagnicola and Fossari (Cort et al. 1957). Miracidium give rise to the first intramolluscan stage, the sporocyst, which asexually gives rise to daughter sporocysts in a form of embryonic amplification. Approximately three weeks after the miracidium penetrates the snail it begins shedding hundreds of furcocercous cercariae per day (Becker and Brunson 1966). These fork-tailed cercariae, easily identified by their bent stem, penetrate the skin of various species of fish; traveling to the lens weeks later.

Past studies have shown infection levels of Diplostomum sp. in fish to increase with both the age and the length of the fish; it has also been demonstrated to depend on the species of fish and the habitat in which the fish are found (Marcogliese 1962). Differences in the number of metacercariae between the right and the left eye has been investigated and shown to have no difference in mean abundance (Marcogliese 1962). Although various aspects affecting the infectivity of Diplostomum sp. in species of fish has been shown in a variety of locations (Marcogliese 1962, Mamer 1978, Valtonen and Gibson 1997), it has never been sufficiently examined in fish of Douglas Lake, Michigan.

In this study, various aspects of the morphology of fish, different species and locations around Douglas Lake were considered as factors that may affect the infectivity of Diplostomum flexicaudum in the fish species evaluated. The locations were picked to vary habitat and evaluate the importance of proximity to the definitive hosts of D. flexicaudum. It was hypothesized that the number of metacercariae in the eye would increase with length and weight of the fish, as well as the weight of the eye. It was further proposed that the fish caught near where the definitive host congregates would have the highest mean abundance of metacercariae.

Materials and Methods
The present experiments were conducted in Cort Laboratory and Lakeside Laboratory at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in Pellston, Michigan (Emmet Co.) from the 16th of July until the sixth of August. All species examined were obtained in one of the seven locations chose around Douglas Lake: Hook Point, Fairy (Pells) Island, Sedge Point, bay south of East Point, boat well on UMBS campus, by the dock on UMBS campus and in front of the teachers' cabins of UMBS (Figure 2). Minnows were obtained with wire minnow traps and by seining, while larger fish species were obtained by line and hook method. The total sample size included 32 Notropis stramineus (sand shiners), 23 Perca flavescens (perch), 11 Notropis cornuta (common shiners), ten Ambloplites rupestris (rock bass), three Micropterus salmoides (largemouth bass), one Ictalurus sp. (catfish), one juvenile Catostomus commersoni (white sucker) and two Lepomis gibbosus (pumpkinseed).

Figure 2: Locations fish were caught and trapped on Douglas Lake, Pellston, MI

Each time a minnow trap was set out the depth of water was measured to the nearest cm; a GPS reading was taken at each of the seven locations. The weather conditions during collection were recorded and the habitat of each location noted. The length of collected specimens was measured (mm) and each was weighed (g) using a scale accurate to three decimal places (Denver Instruments XL-410 Denver, CO). The right and left eyes were then removed, placed in cold-blooded ringers and weighed individually. Each eye was dissected separately in a Petri dish (Pyrex) by teasing apart the eye with dissecting prongs and carefully popping the lens. The number of metacercariae were counted, using a dissecting microscope (Baush & Lomb, Rochester, NY .7x-3x). The number of metacercariae in each eye was recorded by removing each metacercaria individually with a glass pipette to get the most accurate result possible.

The larger fish species were sexed before disposal; however this was not possible with the juveniles or minnow species. The smaller fish were numbered and frozen for further reference and data collection. The frozen fish were used to identify the species of minnow and juveniles that were collected over the course of the study and this information was recorded (personal communication with Amy Schrank, Ph.D.).

All analyses were run in Microsoft Office Excel, 2003. One-way analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) were run to test species versus total number of metacercariae in the eye, location versus total number of metacercariae in the eye, and weight versus location. Regressions were run to test length or weight versus the total number of metacercariae. A t-test assuming unequal variance was run to compare the number of metacercariae in the right eye to the number of metacercariae in the left eye.

Results
A significant correlation between the species and total number of metacercariae in the eye was found (F=13.659, p=0.000298; Figure 3). The perch had a mean abundance of 170.739 metacercariae in both eyes with 100 percent prevalence. The total number of metacercariae in the eyes of perch ranged from 12 to 701. The common shiner had a mean of abundance of 2.626 metacercariae in both eyes with 81.81 percent prevalence. The mean intensity, mean number of metacercariae per infected fish, for the common shiner was 3.22. The mean abundance for the sand shiner was 3.562 metacercariae with 90.63 percent prevalence and a mean intensity of six. The range of metacercariae for the common shiner and sand shiner were both zero to thirteen. Every rock bass that was sampled had zero metacercariae in the eyes. The other species dissected also had zero metacercariae in the eyes but the sample size was deemed to small to be considered real results.

The total number of metacercariae did not show a significant correlation with the weight of the fish when all species were considered because non-infected adult species with comparably considerable weights were included (Figure 4). However, when only the infected species of fish (perch, common shiners, and sand shiners) were considered together, the total number of metacercariae in the fish did show a significant positive correlation with the weight of the fish (F=78.498, p=9.935E-13; Figure 5). Weight versus total number of metacercariae for individual species showed the strongest positive correlation for perch (Figure 6) but also showed a positive correlation for common shiners and sand shiners.

The total number of metacercariae was shown to increase with length when the infected species of fish were considered together (F=89.63, p=8.709E-14). Each species individually also showed a positive correlation between length and the total number of metacercariae observed. Sand shiners showed the strongest positive correlation while perch and common shiners showed about the same strength positive correlation (Figure 7 & 8).

Location versus the number of metacercariae was shown to be significant for perch (F=14.23, p=0.0005; Figure 10), as it was for both species of minnow. However, weight versus location for all species individually was also shown to be significant. The results showing location as significant were more likely because of the weight of the fish caught at a specific location than the actual location or habitat.

Figure 9: Bar graph showing average number of metacercariae in perch by location.

As expected, the number of metacercariae in the right eye was not shown to be significantly different from the number of metacercariae in the left eye. However, the total number of metacercariae in the eye was shown to correlate significantly with the total weight eye weight of the fish when looked at for all infected species together (F=121.91, p=1.84E-16). It was also significant for perch and common shiners individually, but not for sand shiners.

Discussion
The results confirm that there is a large variation in the number of metacercariae among fish species, ranging from non infection of the rock bass to heavily-infected perch. Many of the other species that were examined appeared to have a zero percent infection rate as well, such as pumpkinseeds and largemouth bass; however their sample sizes were not large enough to make a conclusion. Since such a large variation was shown in the number of metacercariae between the adult species, as well as the minnow species, size cannot be considered the only source of variation. Because it can be assumed that all fish species examined were exposed to the cercariae of Diplostomum flexicaudum, there must be another factor affecting the distribution of the metacercariae among the fish species.

Variation among fish species could simply be due to the differences in host physiology and/or anatomy. An unlikely possibility could be that the parasite itself is host specific and will preferentially infect only certain species of fish. It is also possible that the species of fish with zero percent prevalence has evolved a resistance to D. flexicaudum. Three of the fish species considered in this study with a zero percent prevalence of infection are from the same family-Centrarchidae: the rock bass, pumpkinseed and largemouth bass. It may be that this family as a whole has acquired a resistance to the parasite. This should be further evaluated with more fish species and greater sample sizes, while controlling for location. All of the rock bass considered in this study were collected from the same location which may affect the results obtained. It would also be of interest to conduct a study in the laboratory with these species of fish to determine if they can be infected experimentally. This would show whether it is the fish species that prevents the infection or a different factor that affects the distribution of metacercariae among the fish.

Although the length, weight, and the eye weight of the fish were shown to be insignificant when all species of the sample were considered, they were shown to be important when just the infected species of fish were evaluated as a group. As the size of different morphological characteristics, such as the length, increased in the fish so did the number of metacercariae in the eye. It is hypothesized that the metacercariae increase as the weight and length of susceptible fish increase because there is more surface area for the cercariae to utilize while penetrating the fish. The increase of parasites with eye weight could be because of the increased space in which the parasites are able to reside, or possibly because of a greater availability of resources provided by a larger host. A study carried out by Cort (1957) showed that the abundance of sporocysts of Diplostomum flexicaudum also increases as the size of the first intermediate host increases. Although these finding could be a consequence of fewer resources available to the parasite in smaller hosts, it is also possible that the metacercariae, like the sporocyst stages, are able to differentiate between the sizes of hosts.

Parasites that have been associated with hosts over a long period of time usually show a reduced virulence as a consequence of coevolution with the host (Ridley 2004). The obligatory relationship between the host and parasite make it beneficial to the parasite not to decrease the survivorship of the host to the point of death. Diplostomum flexicaudum may have evolved a mechanism allowing it to reproduce less in smaller hosts, thereby reducing the number of fatalities. Furthermore, the fish species found to have a zero percent infection rate may have evolved host defenses against D. flexicaudum faster than the parasite was able to adapt to the fish, causing the metacercariae to be ineffective in those fish species.

This study also found location to be a possible factor in the level of infection in the fish. Unfortunately, because of time constraint and bad weather conditions, the sample size was too small to know if the positive correlation between the number of metacercariae and location was due to the actual location or the weight of the fish caught at the different sites. Many factors could affect whether or not habitat location has an impact on the number of metacercariae infecting any one fish. This study hypothesized that the hosts with the largest parasite abundance would be found in close proximity to area where the definitive host frequents. Because only one fish was caught at Fairy Island, where gulls often congregate, the results are inconclusive. Making the highly unlikely assumption that sample size did not affect the results, the low number of metacercariae in the fish eye could be explained by a lack of snails in the area. Even if the definitive host is present in abundance, all other species of the life cycle must be present as well in order for the parasite to perpetuate. It would be useful to do a snail survey in the areas where fish were caught, including an assessment of how many were shedding cercariae.

Assuming location is not significant to the distribution of metacercariae in fish, one might consider the migration capabilities of fish species. If the fish migrates a great deal between locations it would be assumed that the site would not have an effect. Different habitats could also be looked at in further studies to determine if the fish species preference for certain surroundings affect the infection rates of Diplostomum flexicaudum. Although the sample size for this study limited the significant results, many of the findings can be expanded upon in further investigations of the relationships between Diplostomum flexicaudum and its varying infectivity of fish species.

Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Malaria in the Twenty-first Century,"I. Malaria Disease and Transmission

Malaria is caused by a parasite with the genus Plasmodium. There are only four known species of Plasmodium that cause malaria: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. The vectors that transmit malaria are female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are over 430 known genus species of Anopheles, but only about 30-50 of them can actually transmit the parasite.

Normally malaria is a curable disease, but only if treated properly. After an infectious bite there is an incubation period in the host that varies depending on the species of Plasmodium, before there is an onset of symptoms. The symptoms of malaria that a human host will go through can be categorized as either uncomplicated or severe. With uncomplicated malaria, the symptoms last between 6-10 hours and include a cold stage, a hot stage and then finally a sweating stage. Symptoms occur in a mixture of fever, chills, sweats, headaches, nausea, vomiting, body aches, and general malaise.

Severe, or complicated, malaria occurs when a human host is infected by P. falciparum and it is complicated by organ failure or irregularity in the host's blood or metabolism. This kind of infection usually occurs in patients that have little or no immunity to malaria, this most often occurs to those who live in an area with low (or no) malaria infections.

Relapses can occur in P. vivaxand P. ovale infections. This is because they have dormant liver stage parasites, called hypnozoites that may reactivate months or years later. There are no symptoms between relapses, and there is also treatment to avoid such occurrences.

The life cycle of Malaria consists of two hosts: humans and Anopheles mosquitoes. In humans, the parasite grows rapidly in the liver cells at first and then moves to the red blood cells. During this growth, the red blood cells are destroyed and release daughter merozoites that will go on to invade more red blood cells. It is during this blood stage that the symptoms of malaria are present.

When a human infected with the malaria parasite during this blood stage a female Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal from the human host and it can pick up a certain forms of blood stage parasites. The parasite then proliferates in the mosquito and after 10-18 days the parasite exists as a sporozoite. When the mosquito goes to take a blood meal from another human, the sporozoites are injected with the saliva of the mosquito and thus infecting the human.

II. The State of the Problem
There are about 300-500 million malaria cases per year throughout the world resulting in 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths. It is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in developing countries. Forty percent of the world's population, about 200 billion people, is at risk in over 90 countries. In the 1960s, only ten percent of the world's population was at risk for malaria. The risk rose to forty percent as mosquitoes developed resistance to pesticides and malaria parasites developed resistance to treatment drugs.

Although prevalence of malaria has increased substantially worldwide since the 1960s, in recent years it has begun to stabilize slightly. In the early 1990s, many countries tried a new strategy against malaria that ended up causing higher rates of incidence. Since these countries went back to using pesticides, malaria incidence has decreased dramatically. In conclusion, the problem is worse overall, but it has improved in recent years.

III Control of Malaria
Malaria control does not aim to eliminate malaria permanently because right now it is not realistic. A program for malaria control would have to include treatment to individual cases using antimalerial drugs, vector control, bed nets and treatment for pregnant women.

Vector control is a successful method of control, and it lead to the eradication of malaria in the United States, USSR and southern Europe between the 1940s and the 1960s. The insecticide most widely used for house spraying has been DDT, although it has been banned from us in some countries. DDT is known as a carcinogen, but there is no solid evidence that it causes significant harm to those exposed. DDT has substitutes such as organophosphate or carbamate insecticides and pyrethroids. Bed nets are another form of vector control while people sleep, but they can be less effective when mosquitoes can bite through. Therefore, bed nets are then treated with pyrethroids to add a chemical barrier. It has been found that bednets treat with pyrethroids are more effective than those that are not.

IV. Should the U.S. government be involved in controlling the spread of malaria?
Malaria was once very rampant in the United States, until the 1940s where DDT was used to eradicate it in this country. The mosquitoes that transmit malaria (Anopheles genus) are still very widespread in the US. While there are approximately 1,200 cases of malaria in the United States per year, all but five were contracted from other countries before entry into the US. The five that were contracted here show that malaria can without doubt be once again prevalent in the US. If the United States government allows incidence of malaria to continue to grow in other countries, then it is very possible that the US can once again have malaria circulating here.

A U.S. International Anti-Malaria Program can be very costly, yet it must be done in order to protect the United States from the disease itself. Funding for malaria control in developing countries has been decreasing due to fewer donations, which are needed due to the miniscule budget these countries have to work with. Developing countries cannot yet afford the alternatives to DDT, and they are having enough trouble as it is affording DDT as insecticide to spray homes.

Between 1993 and 1995, many countries in Africa and South America (not Ecuador) significantly decreased the amount of spraying done in their countries. They implemented a new malaria control strategy which did not call for vector control at all. Afterwards however, the incidence of malaria rose tremendously in these countries. Ecuador, however, increased the amount of spraying of DDT and they were the only country to accomplish a decrease in malaria incidence in 1994. Removing vector control has a high cost of increased incidence rates of malaria; therefore vector control is the most imperative element of malaria control.

Insecticide spraying is recommended for the Anti-Malaria Program due to its cost efficiency. DDT will mainly be used, but pyrethroids will be used in cases of DDT resistance because they are the least costly after DDT. A malaria control program in South Africa alone in 2002 was $102,000 US dollars (Tren and Bate, 2004). In order to protect the United States, I would recommend that one million US dollars per year be spent on vector control in South Africa and South America. Since spraying is only involved with the homes, rural areas do not need as much as urban ones. Spraying an entire continent sounds unreasonable, but in perspective is it not.

Also one million dollars per year should be spent on treatment of malaria, primarily because it cannot be transmitted if there are not sick people. Another million dollars will be used to treat those coming into the United States from S. America and S. Africa to avoid transmission in our country. This bring the total cost of the plan to three million dollars, far less than what our government is currently spending. There should be a plan to support malaria control for many years, in order to keep it stabilized.

V. Cost/Benefit and Comparative Analysis of a US International Anti-Malaria Program
Currently the United States is involved with The President's Malaria Initiative, which is the President's plan for malaria relief. This initiative has the same basic points as the plan I have suggested; vector control through spraying homes, insecticide treated bed nets, administer treatments for those ill, and treatment for pregnant women. The main difference between the plans is that the President's initiative is dramatically more costly.

According to usaid.org, the President's initiative is spending 1.2 billion dollars over five years, which equates to 240 million dollars per year. The plan I have proposed is much more cost efficient, more aimed at hitting the problem dead on. The President's plan only targets certain countries, such as Angola, Tanzania, Uganda Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal. With my plan, all of the countries in S. America and S. Africa will be targeted, continuously over many years.

The President's initiative does not mention using DDT, nor does it have an alternative in the cases of DDT resistance (or other insecticide resistance). It is not known right away when DDT resistance occurs, which is one drawback to the plan to use an alternative.

The plan that I have proposed will not involve agents from the United States to go over to these countries. US involvement internationally will purely be a donation aspect. The plan will call for the US to purchase the treatments, DDT (along with supplies needed for spraying) and the pesticide treated nets. The treatments for those traveling into the United States will be purchased and administered in the US by agents of the US government. Though it may not seem reasonable to just send the supplies over without having US officials monitor their use and administration, it is much more cost efficient. The President's initiative has such an enormous cost mainly because it is incorporating the funding for US agents to administer the treatments and insecticides. Malaria is a problem in these developing countries, but it is also a looming problem. It has been there for a while, and it will still be around for a while.

There are bigger issues at stake in the US than malaria and able bodied people can be put to better use. One such issue is the war in Iraq, where many soldiers are still needed. Another issue would be the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Many people are still without a home and there is only a few months left before they have to return their FEMA trailers. I strongly urge that there is an anti-malaria program, but it should not be costing as much American dollars as the President's Initiative and we should not be sending Americans over to help at this time.",86.29,59.51,53.59,36.42,10360
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Case Analysis for Jean 'Redhorse' Osceola,"Our case analysis focused on a seventeen year old Navajo female, Jean 'Redhorse' Osceola, with Depersonalization Disorder. This analysis will begin with an in-depth summary of the disorder followed by an investigation into Jean's situation. This disorder is the third most common psychological disorder in the United States after anxiety and depression. Depersonalization Disorder can cause the person suffering to have anxiety, due to feeling detached from oneself. Additionally, feelings of anxiety can sometimes lead to Depersonalization Disorder. Depersonalization Disorder is a dissociative disorder that causes sufferers to experience feeling disconnected from their bodies. Individuals with this disorder state that it feels as if one knows what is happening during an episode but feels as if she is not the one experiencing it, as if she has dissociated from her own body. Occasional moments of depersonalization are not a threat to one's mental health, but a consistent feeling of depersonalization can interfere with daily life. Brief periods of depersonalization are brought on by acute stress, lack of sleep, or a combination of the two factors. The disorder often begins in the late teens to early twenties and usually resolves itself before the individual reaches age thirty. Depersonalization Disorder is quite concerning to the individual struggling with the mental illness, however, it is of no risk to society since the individual's grasp on reality is not harmed.

Although Depersonalization Disorder is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, some professionals remain skeptical to whether the disorder actually exists. The issue at the heart of this debate is the concept of dissociative identities and whether or not they are a direct product of social influence. Skeptics believe that dissociative disorders, such as Depersonalization Disorder, do not exist but are a manifestation of the social environment one is in. Some skeptics go as far as to say that those diagnosed with these disorders have ulterior motives and many simply have attention-seeking personalities. Clinicians often have a difficult time differentiating symptoms of Depersonalization Disorder from symptoms experienced by those diagnosed with schizophrenia, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, and recreational drug use.

Jean was referred to her high school's social worker after she confided in one of her teachers that she felt like a robot and at times felt as if she could see herself standing outside of her body or floating above her body. When the social worker called in her mother to attend a meeting, the mother tossed out the idea of anything being seriously wrong with Jean. The mother believed Jean simply was not eating a good breakfast and that these periodic spells were insignificant. Jean, on the other hand, expressed concerned about these re-occuring episodes. The social worker questioned whether Jean was experimenting with recreational drugs and Jean replied with a no. Her mother then went on to explain how it is unacceptable for Navojos to drink giving the social worker some insight into Navajo cultural beliefs.

I believe that the social worker responded properly to the information Jean confided in her teacher. By calling her mother into the conference, the social worker would be able to grasp a better understanding of where Jean was coming from and what her support system was like. However, as soon as the social worker realized that the mother was extremely skeptical that anything was wrong with Jean it would have been beneficial to end the conference and then meet solely with Jean. The way the mother stated how it is unacceptable for Navajos to drink was a clear sign of the societal pressure Navajo individuals, such as Jean, faced. Rather than go on asking Jean about alcohol or recreational drugs, the social worker could have spent more time talking to Jean about the diverging daily pressures she faced from her fellow Navajos and from her friends or classmates. Gaining a better understanding of the dominant cultural and societal factors that Jean deals with may have been a more appropriate strategy for understanding her mental illness. Nevertheless, the social worker did do a good job of diagnosing Jean with Depersonalization Disorder based on her episodes and her lack of hallucinations, voices, and feelings of depression.

Most likely the social worker would have referred Jean to a professional who would have either given her weekly therapy sessions, prescribed her medications, or both. Although there is no particular drug or drug cocktail that is approved specifically for treating those with Depersonalization Disorder, those who are prescribed drugs usually receive antidepressants and psychotrophic medications. However, most drug cocktails focus on the anxiety, mood swings, and depression that are associated with Depersonalization Disorder. They focus on managing the disorder's symptoms and not the disorder itself. Consequently, medications may not be the best solution to Depersonalization Disorder since they do not deal directly with the issue at hand and therefore the chance of a full recovery is quite unrealistic.

Like many mental illnesses, Depersonalization Disorder can serve as a kind of coping mechanism or defense mechanism that evolved during times of high stress or abuse, physical or mental. In this sense, therapy can be incredibly beneficial in empowering the individual suffering with the disorder. Therapy can help a person to acknowledge the pain they suffered and recognize that the abuse they experienced was not in any way their fault. It can validate repressed feelings and help a person realize their own potential and ability to be independent. Specifically, behavioral therapy can help one gain the confidence necessary to begin the process of recovery. Practicing acting out emotions and feelings rather than suppressing them allows one to gain the skills necessary to overcome this disorder. A full recovery from Depersonalization Disorder is far more realistic when the disorder itself is the focus of the treatment being administered, such as through a more feminist approach.

A feminist approach would not see drugs as the solution to Depersonalization Disorder, but would acknowledge who Jean is and where she is coming from. Jean is Native American and a young women growing up in a society dominated by white, heterosexual males. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fails to take into account the fact that she is more than just a female experiencing depersonalization spells. A professional might take the information he learns about Jean after one or two visits, match her symptoms up to the checklists listed in the DSM, and diagnose her with a mental disorder. The feminist approach, on the other hand, would reject this snapshot diagnosis. It refuses to accept that someone's current feelings and physical symptoms construct a complete representation of her entire mental condition. Instead, a feminist approach would take into account various events that occurred in one's life and interpret the influence they had on forming that person's self-identity.

A feminist therapist would work with Jean to create a personalized model of recovery. The therapist's goals would include empowering Jean by focusing on ways that she feels oppressed and what stressors exist in her life. Growing up in a society that is dominantly white could be hard for a member of any minority and must be especially hard for someone of a stigmatized minority, such as Jean. The fact that Navajos are a self-respecting group of individuals who look down on things, such as drinking, considered the norm by the dominant culture could be a huge stressor in Jean's life. The feminist therapist may take into account the fact that she feels as if she is representing her people whenever she is out of her home. One part of her may feel the need to fit in and assimilate to the dominant culture while another part of her may feel committed to being a respected Navajo. Being this cautious of her own actions and always feeling as if she is the token for her minority could be a major influencing factor when it comes to her mental health. Her self-scrutiny could be reflected in her depersonalization episodes as her constant self-analysis is symbolized in the actual removal of herself from her physical body. The feminist therapist could use this knowledge to help empower Jean and provide her with the support to become comfortable with exploring her two identities. After gaining a better understanding of Jean's internalized struggles, the therapist can begin to help her redefine herself as an appreciated and productive member of both of her worlds.

By explaining to Jean that she has already overcome so many obstacles, the therapist can focus on providing Jean with coping skills. Acknowledging that Jean is a women living in a male-dominated society forces Jean to recognize that she has already triumphed over incredible adversity and she has done this on her own. Additionally, the therapist can encourage Jean to see how far she has come regardless by providing her fact such as how the poverty rate among Native Americans is more than double that of the United States as a whole (25.9% versus 11.3% according to the 2000 Census) with a 46% unemployment rate. Jean needs to be empowered and the therapist can help her perform a positive self-assessment though the use of a feminist lens.

When it comes to dealing directly with Depersonalization Disorder, the feminist therapist can provide Jean with connections to various support groups and Depersonalization Communities including those that focus on women. There is a great deal of advice out there written specifically by women for women who have suffered from Depersonalization Disorder. Some of it pertains to the effect hormones, due to PMS, pregnancy, Menopause, or the Pill, have on the emotions of someone suffering from this disorder. One piece of advice that has consistently proved beneficial is the keeping of a daily journal. This daily journal can track one's emotions as well as her Depersonalization symptoms. As a result, one's natural hormone cycle can be tracked and directly linked to intensified periods of depersonalization episodes, depression, and anxiety. This enables one to know what to expect and when, enabling someone living with or recovering from Depersonalization Disorder to live a more productive and less hindered life. Additional support can come from various counseling centers such as NAMI, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. NAMI is located in downtown Ann Arbor and provides confidential services to those suffering with a mental illness and friends and family members of persons with mental illness. NAMI support group sessions are facilitated by professional NAMI members who provide free of charge services to anyone interested.",53.05,69.09,46.27,25.29,10982
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Sexual Selection and Male Sacrifice: From Darwin until Now,"In order to elicit copulation from females, males will often offer mating gifts as an enticement. Mating gifts, such as a juicy fly, are ultimately given to lengthen the time for sperm transfer, increasing the chance for paternity (Thornhill 1976). Andrade has shown that in Australian Redback spiders (Latrodectus hasseiti), the male gives the ultimate mating gift - his own body. There has been some resistance to the idea that being consumed during copulation could be an adaptive strategy for the male. This is not simply the case of a more dominant female overcoming the weaker male during copulation. A somersault behavior that has been observed in the field, in which the abdomen of the male is placed directly under the female’s mouthparts, has shown the male’s complicity in the cannibalism (Andrade 1996). This apparently suicidal behavior actually gives an adaptive advantage to the male and is favored by sexual selection for the paternal advantages gained (Andrade 1996). This review will show how the idea of sexual selection has been shaped throughout the past century and half since Darwin. It will follow Darwin’s idea through time, and show how it has allowed Andrade to come to the conclusion that male copulatory suicide is in fact an adaptive strategy, and further, will show how Andrade has come to influence the evolutionary community today.

Sexual Selection was originally proposed by Darwin in The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859. He stated that [Sexual selection] depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females: the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is an immediate competition for females in the ultimate battle to perpetuate one’s genes. In 1871 Darwin expanded on this idea. He reasoned that in the struggle for mates, any characteristic that grants success will have a sexually-selective value. This sexually-selected trait will be perpetuated regardless of the natural-selective value of this same trait. Sexual selection could occur during female choice between rival males using male display-characters (otherwise known as inter-sexual selection) or could occur during combat between rival males (or intra-sexual selection) (Darwin 1871).

Darwin had indirectly shown the two different selective forces acting during reproduction: natural selection and sexual selection. Sexual selection, unlike natural selection, has the ability to select for characteristics that are no longer advantageous for survival, but that have a high sexually-selective value. Fisher, in 1930, expanded upon Darwin’s ideas and predicted that when there is a display-based intra-sexual advantage among males, the reinforcement by female selection for this trait will initiate a run-away evolutionary process which will sometimes lead to characters deleterious in the general struggle for existence (Fisher 1930). According to Fisher’s run-away model, then, deleterious genes are able to evolve when females preferentially select for specific display-based characteristics via sexual selection.

Huxley, in 1938, pointed out that the more intense the intra-sexual competition, the more likely it will be that characteristics that are deleterious to existence will evolve. This is because the intensity of selective advantage is more sharply graded by intra-sexual competition than by any other type of selection (Huxley 1938). This can be attributed to what he calls the fractional reproductive advantage, where the fitness of a trait is limited by the reproductive capacity of a singe female or to the all-or-nothing mating advantage where some individuals fail to secure mates at all. The all-or-nothing model has two components. The successful males may only obtain one mate, as in monogamous species, or they may be able to obtain more than one mate, exemplified by polygamous and promiscuous species. Only in the latter can characteristics that are deleterious to existence evolve (Huxley 1938).

Although it may seem that natural selection would be able to eliminate such deleterious characteristics, they do in fact occur in nature (exemplified by the Australian Redback spider). In these cases, the genetic benefit gained by this characteristic (an increase in one’s fertility) outweighs the phenotypic cost incurred (the loss of one’s life). According to Bateman (1948), because a male’s fertility depends on the number of matings he gets, there would be selection for polygamous tendencies in males, producing an indiscriminate eagerness in mating. Females, on the other hand, would show a discriminating passivity (Bateman 1948). This can be seen in sexual selection. In a polygamous species there will be competition for these discriminate females. This can lead to characteristics that are sexually advantageous, but deleterious to existence, as previously hypothesized by Huxley.

As a result of considerable competition for females, male parental investment will decrease while mating effort increases. Trivers, in 1972, hypothesized that because parental investment will lower the number of copulations a male can obtain, intra-sexual selection will offset the selection for increased parental investment, therefore decreasing male parental investment (Trivers 1972). Females, on the other hand, make a greater initial investment in their offspring and will have a greater selective pressure for parental investment. Discord between selection for low paternal parental investment and female preference for increased male parental investment has resulted in nuptial feeding (Thornhill 1976). The male can then occupy a female with the consumption of his mating gift, granting him an increased chance of a successful mating.

An extreme example of nuptial feeding would be the mating gift of one’s own body, as in sexual cannibalism. Although at the time there were not much empirical data, Buskirk in 1984 predicted that sexual cannibalism would only be observed in species where males normally expect few matings and in which cannibalism would increase the number of offspring produced from a mating. This is exemplified by the male copulatory suicides of the Australian Redback spiders (Latrodectus hasseiti). It was found by Andrade in 1996 that cannibalized males were able to copulate longer than those that were not eaten. When the female submits to copulation, the male performs a somersault behavior, in which the abdomen is placed directly under the female’s mouthparts (Andrade 1996). The female then proceeds to consume the male while copulation continues. This act of copulatory suicide is simply an extension of a mating gift; females will permit longer copulations when they are occupied by eating the male, therefore giving the male a longer time for sperm transfer to occur. Further, females were less likely to mate with another male after consumption of their first. This apparently suicidal behavior gives an adaptive advantage to the male. Because males are unlikely to be able to mate more than once even if they do survive copulation, the cost of being eaten is low and sexual cannibalism has been favored by sexual selection for the paternal advantages gained (Andrade 1996).

Even though there is a direct benefit to the male, with a cost as great as one’s life to mate, one would predict there to be selection for traits to allow them to escape cannibalism. Fromhage (2005) showed experimentally that opportunistic mating with females who are already feeding greatly reduces the risk of cannibalism. As a further benefit, when it is mechanically possible to copulate with a female that has already mated, the chance of fertilization of that female’s eggs is over 60 percent. This is an incredible success rate and one has to wonder why this strategy has not been selected for, and how there is such a high success rate given the shortened copulation duration.

Snow in 2004 tested the assumption made by Andrade that sperm transfer is limited by copulation duration. Snow surprisingly discovered that the majority of sperm was transferred in the first five minutes of copulation. Increased paternity due to copulation duration could therefore be due to the transfer of nongametic ejaculatory substances or cryptic female choice. According to Snow’s research, cannibalism itself may even play a role in sperm transfer (Snow 2004).

From the first idea of sexual selection proposed by Darwin only 150 years ago, Andrade was able to come to the conclusion that an action that seemed to be male copulatory suicide was actually an adaptive strategy to perpetuate one’s genes. This idea, as well as that of Darwin and his predecessors, has already had its hand in further research. Further studies will need to be done to determine why opportunistic mating does not occur more often in nature if it is coupled with such a high success rate and exactly why copulation duration coincides with increased paternity when sperm transfer is limited to the first five minutes. Through this paper one can see - much like many of the complex behaviors that we observe today - how dramatically a single idea can evolve throughout time.",0,0,0,2.24,9212
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,Assessing selection hypotheses for the CCR5-∆32 mutation in Europeans,"Introduction
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has become a pandemic that has devastated many regions of the world. Yet in some European populations, there is a mutation called CCR5-∆32 that confers almost complete protection against HIV in homozygotes and partial protection in heterozygotes. Many scientists suggest some force other than HIV has exerted positive selection for this mutation allele. Several hypotheses and models have been proposed as to how this mutation arose as well as how its frequency may have increased over time. This paper seeks to investigate the cause(s) of positive selection proposed by these hypotheses and models. The hypotheses and models of interest include: Duncan et al’s plague hypothesis, Galvani and Slatkin’s smallpox hypothesis, Balanovsky et al’s ecological factors model, and a Bronze Age hypothesis suggested by Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli.

Background
CCR5 is a transmembrane chemokine receptor that strains of HIV-1 use to enter immune cells such as macrophages and CD4 T-cells. A 32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 (called CCR5-∆32) prevents the expression of the CCR5 receptor on the cell surface (Duncan et al, 2005). The CCR5-∆32 mutation allele thus interferes with the ability of HIV-1 to infect immune cells. Other mutations in the CCR5 gene and genes of the chemokine receptor gene family also reduce infection rate, but their effects on HIV infection are significantly less compared to the effects of CCR5-∆32 (Balanovsky et al, 2005).

Individuals homozygous for CCR5-∆32 have almost complete resistance to HIV-1 infection (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). Heterozygous individuals for CCR5-∆32 have partial resistance conferring a 70% reduced risk of HIV infection compared to individuals without the mutation allele (Duncan et al, 2005). Heterozygous individuals who do become infected with HIV have a slow progression towards AIDS where onset is delayed for two to three additional years (Balanovsky et al, 2005).

The frequency of CCR5-∆32 is estimated to be about 10%, on average, in European populations (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). In addition, there is a north-south gradient in allele frequencies with the highest allele frequencies in northern European populations – about 16% in Finnish and Russian populations – and the lowest in southern European populations – about 4% in Sardinia (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005). The CCR5-∆32 allele is found in low frequencies in regions neighboring Europe such as North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia (Balanovsky et al, 2005), but is absent in East and South-east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and indigenous American populations (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005).

According to Balanovsky et al, this pattern is unusual for genes in human populations. In 1998, Libert et al determined the CCR5-∆32 mutation to be about 2000 years old using microsatellites linked with the CCR5 gene. Another study that same year by Stephens et al found strong linkage disequilibrium between two microsatellite markers and CCR5-∆32, showing the CCR5-∆32 mutation to be only about 700 years old (Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005; Sabeti et al, 2005). Despite this seemingly wide range in age estimates for CCR5-∆32, 95% confidence intervals in both cases span a few thousand years (Balanovsky et al, 2005). Some of the studies assessed in this paper appear to use the age estimate of 700 years old.

Most studies on CCR5-∆32 believe this mutation has a single and recent origin in Europe where the frequency of this mutation increased dramatically from 0% to 10% in a historically short period of time. Balanovsky et al also state that such a dramatic increase in allele frequency in a large population cannot be due to random genetic drift. As a result, most studies also believe positive selection should be considered (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005; Duncan et al, 2005).

Plague Hypothesis
In 1998, Stephens et al hypothesized that a plague epidemic caused the rapid increase in the mutation frequency (Balanovsky et al; 2005). The Black Death between 1346 and 1352 killed up to 40% of Europe’s population and has been suggested to be this single plague epidemic (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Duncan et al, 2005). The bubonic plague was assumed to be the cause of the Black Death pandemic and after the Black Death, plague epidemics occurred approximately every 10 years for about 400 years (Duncan et al, 2005). A second pandemic known as the Great Plague in 1665 and 1666 killed 15-20% of Europe’s population, but after this pandemic the plague declined in Europe and virtually disappeared from Europe in 1750 (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003). Furthermore, the area where CCR5-∆32 is found today corresponds with the range of the plagues (Duncan et al, 2005). Because the plagues resulted in high mortality, there would be significant selection for any inherited plague-resistance-inducing factor (Balanovsky et al, 2005).

While this hypothesis and model for the dramatic frequency increase of CCR5-∆32 is largely accepted, it has also recently fallen under heavy criticisms. Balanovsky et al point out that this hypothesis relies heavily on statistical analyses and that it has not been proven clinically or molecularly. According to Duncan et al, the Black Death would at most double the frequency of CCR5-∆32 from an initial frequency of 5x10-5 to 10-4. Galvani and Slatkin suggest that the indirect transmission from rodent reservoirs to humans via fleas explains the intermittent emergence of plague epidemics, and that this may further limit positive selection. Furthermore, the pathogen that causes the bubonic plague, the bacteria Yersinia pestis, does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect (Duncan et al, 2005).

Duncan et al have thus hypothesized a modified version of the plague model. They suggest that an unknown virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with a 100% case mortality was the true pathogen responsible for the Black Death. This virus enters immune cells via the CCR5 receptor and the regular plague epidemics of Europe’s Middle Ages serve to dramatically increase the frequency of CCR5-∆32.

The results of Duncan et al’s modeling show how the frequency of CCR5-∆32 could be dramatically increased from 10-5 to today’s 10% through continuous selection pressure over 320 years due to this hemorrhagic fever virus. While the age estimate of 700 years coincides with the Black Death, Duncan et al acknowledge that the original CCR5-∆32 mutation likely arose much earlier. They mention a study where the rates of crossing over between the IRI3.1 microsatellite and CCR5-∆32 occurred about 3500 years ago, though they suggest the CCR5-∆32 probably appeared over 2500 years ago. Duncan et al also indicate that sporadic outbreaks of plague before the Black Death could have partly accounted for the increase in the CCR5-∆32 mutation allele.

Finally, the plague largely disappeared in Europe after 1670; without any selective pressure, the frequency of CCR5-∆32 would decrease over the next 300 years as a result of genetic drift (Duncan et al, 2005). According to Duncan et al, smallpox and sustained plague in northeastern Europe could have accounted for its continued high frequency. Since the Myxoma poxvirus, a relative of smallpox, uses the CCR5 receptor to enter the white blood cells of rabbits, CCR5-∆32 would likely have provided at least partial resistance to smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, maintaining selective pressure almost until the emergence of HIV (Duncan et al, 2005). Furthermore, there is evidence that the hemorrhagic plague proposed by Duncan et al may have persisted in Scandinavia and Russia well after 1670, thus maintaining selective pressures in that region of Europe. This could also explain why the CCR5-∆32 allele is found in higher frequencies around Scandinavia and Russia.

Although Duncan et al’s hypothesis appears plausible, it is very difficult to prove. Due the rapid decline of plague in Europe around the 18th century, the unknown virus that caused the plagues of hemorrhagic fever presumably no longer afflicts humans. Furthermore, there is not sufficient proof to support that the plagues ravaging across Europe for centuries was indeed due to this virus and not the bubonic plague. The greatest weakness in Duncan et al’s hypothesis, however, is that it is based on speculations about a virus that no longer exists and thus cannot be studied.

Smallpox Hypothesis
Galvani and Slatkin proposed an alternative to the plague hypothesis. They believed that the plague epidemics and outbreaks occurred too intermittently to have applied consistent selective pressure to dramatically increase the frequency of CCR5-∆32. Galvani and Slatkin state that, while the plagues killed a significant percentage of Europe’s population at a given time, the total mortality from the plagues only impacted a small percent of Europe’s overall population across time. Thus, they suggested that smallpox is the selective pressure that caused the dramatic increase of CCR5-∆32.

Galvani and Slatkin first stated that the direct person-to-person transmission of smallpox provided a far more continuous selective pressure. Smallpox epidemics were frequent and mostly affected children under ten-years-old; it was thus considered a childhood disease (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005). Furthermore, smallpox had approximately a 30% fatality rate (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003) and since it affected children, the allele frequency changed over generations more effectively (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Balanovsky et al, 2005). Therefore, whereas the plague would result in strong but interspersed selection, smallpox results in weaker yet continuous selection.

Galvani and Slatkin’s model shows that the age range of an affected population can affect the selection of a resistance allele when the population is afflicted episodically by a disease with a high mortality. A crucial point was that the initial frequency of CCR5-∆32, p0, was the same for both the bubonic plague and smallpox. When they assumed the resistance allele was dominant, the 400 years of bubonic plague epidemics did not provide sufficient selective pressure to drive the frequency up to 1%. In contrast, the more continuous smallpox mortality on European children could provide the necessary selective pressure in that time. When incomplete dominance was assumed, Galvani and Slatkin calculated that 1135 years of smallpox epidemics would have been required; this is well within the 95% confidence interval of the age estimate of 700 years provided by Stephen et al. Galvani and Slatkin further state that heterozygous fitness was important to how quickly evolution occurs in the case of a resistance allele, as most of the selection is through the heterozygotes when the frequency of the resistance allele is initially very low.

Galvani and Slatkin thus believe the original CCR5-∆32 mutation originated 1000-2000 years ago in northern Europe and was then dispersed across Europe down a continuous gradient to the south via Viking conquests as proposed by Lucotte in 2001 (Balanovsky et al, 2005). Interestingly, smallpox also affected Scandinavia more than the rest of Europe, which could lead to its higher frequencies of CCR5-∆32 (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003). And again, smallpox is clinically more likely than the bubonic plague to cause the dramatic increase of CCR5-∆32 because of the differing modes of infection. Poxviruses enter immune cells via chemokine receptors like the CCR5 receptor, whereas the bubonic plague pathogen does not (Galvani and Slatkin, 2003; Duncan et al, 2005).

But the smallpox hypothesis is not without criticisms. Balanovsky et al argue that the smallpox hypothesis also relies heavily on statistical analyses from historical accounts, and is not based on real clinical or molecular genetic data. Duncan et al mentioned that a lethal variant of smallpox did not arrive until around 1628 and before that date, smallpox was not reputed to be a serious malady. Thus the continuous selection provided by smallpox could only have been effective between about 1700 and 1830, and according to Duncan et al’s modeling, over 600 years of smallpox epidemics would be required to increase the frequency of CCR5-∆32 to 10%.

Ecological Factors
A third hypothesis looked at ecological factors and what role they may have had in the distribution of the CCR5-∆32 allele. Balanovsky et al reasoned that some ecological factors, such as climate, could provide selective pressures in differing parts of the world. Balanovsky et al thus compiled a global database on CCR5-∆32 using data from 51 published sources, totaling 36,436 samples from 264 populations. They also included 3,784 samples from 35 populations in Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova for the first time. With such a large sample size, Balanovsky et al were able to construct an updated and more detailed map of CCR5-∆32 frequency distributions. In addition, Balanovsky et al also gathered data on the spatial distribution of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and precipitation for the first half of the 20th century before global warming.

Based on this more detailed map of CCR5-∆32 distributions, Balanovsky et al found the highest frequency of CCR5-∆32 to be in the areas surrounding the Baltic Sea and subsequently decreasing gradually in all directions away from that region. Additional modeling modified the map distribution of CCR5-∆32 according to the clinal hypothesis and the diffusion from one center hypothesis. Balanovsky et al found strong correlations between the initial map and the maps modified for these two hypotheses. Additional correlation analysis found the correlation between temperature and CCR5-∆32 to be higher than all other climatic parameters. Balanovsky et al also further tested the second hypothesis by obtaining correlations between frequencies and the studied populations and their geographic distances from the CCR5-∆32 origin.

Balanovsky et al admit that their study might be better used to reject, rather than prove, some hypotheses. As they acquired new data on CCR5-∆32 distribution, Balanovsky et al found that the correlation with climate actually decreased, though it still remained significant. They reason that, while the relationship between CCR5-∆32 and climate is not straightforward, it may play a part in selection, for example having an effect on plague in colder climates. Furthermore, Balanovsky et al asserted that gene flow, genetic drift, and migration cannot explain the continued high frequencies of CCR5-∆32 across Europe. While the Viking dispersal across Europe might have initially resulted in the gradient spread of CCR5-∆32, selection would have been required to maintain the frequencies in the European populations (Balanovsky et al, 2005).

It is difficult to determine how much of an effect, if any, ecological factors had in the selection of CCR5-∆32. Balanovsky et al provided no mechanism or convincing reason why certain environmental factors would cause the frequency of CCR5-∆32 to increase over time, or what effect climate had on plague or smallpox. They also did not explain how the frequency of CCR5-∆32 could have been maintained after the Viking dispersal across Europe. Certainly, the hypothesis proposed by Balanovsky et al is weaker compared to either the plague or smallpox models.

Bronze Age Hypothesis
In a radical break from previous hypotheses asserting a single and recent origin, a study by Sabeti et al found CCR5-∆32 to be less remarkable as a mutation, whereas a study by Hedrick and Verrelli found CCR5-∆32 to be far older than previous thought.

Sabeti et al carried out SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping around CCR5 in multiple populations. When the data was compared against the human genome and genetic maps, Sabeti et al found CCR5-∆32 was not unique in terms of genetic diversity relative to other variants at CCR5 or even throughout the human genome. They then assessed the high CCR5-∆32 frequencies by looking at the heterozygosity about CCR5 to further determine its genetic diversity; if a selection sweep has occurred, diversity would decrease, but if balancing selection occurred, then diversity would increase (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). If CCR5-∆32 was subjected to a selection sweep by positive selection, it would remove linked variants as its frequency increases in a population (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). Thus heterozygosity in SNPs near CCR5 should decrease, but when analyzed for recent directional positive selection and multiple selection sweeps at a locus, Sabeti et al did not find this to be the case. They assert that while these tests found no evidence of positive selection, it cannot be wholly ruled out.

Furthermore, if the dramatic increase in CCR5-∆32 frequency was a relatively recent event, there should be high linkage disequilibrium near CCR5-∆32 (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). The linkage disequilibrium in regions distal (further away) to CCR5 showed similar frequencies to other CCR5 haplotypes, but regions proximal (near) to CCR5 showed higher disequilibrium (Sabeti et al, 2005; Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). This may suggest that although the CCR5-∆32 allele might have increased recently, it might also be much older than previous studies.

By analyzing DNA samples, a study by Hummel et al found similar frequencies of CCR5-∆32 in Bronze Age skeletons 2900 years ago and in modern Germans (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). In addition, Hummel et al did not find reduced CCR5-∆32 frequencies in a sample of 14th century plague victims, and thus might not have provided any protection against the plague. Using a new genetic map with 32 SNP markers closer to CCR5 increased the estimate age of CCR5-∆32 to about 5075 years, consistent with the Bronze Age data (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). Hedrick and Verrelli assert that the CCR5-∆32 allele was present long before either plague or smallpox could have exerted positive selection.

The studies by Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli suggest that CCR5-∆32 is not as unique a variant as popularly believed and may in fact be older than previous estimates. While these two studies conclude that the original selection for CCR5-∆32 is older than previously thought, and with a lack of evidence for positive selection since, nothing can be ruled out. Furthermore, the findings by Hummel et al in 14th century plague victims who also possessed the CCR5-∆32 mutation allele does, however, support Duncan et al’s modified plague hypothesis or Galvani and Slatkin’s smallpox hypothesis in that CCR5-∆32 probably conferred no protection against the bubonic plague. More than anything, the data from these two studies present questions rather than answers.

Discussion and Conclusion
Each of the five studies addresses different hypotheses for the origin of CCR5-∆32 and its continued high frequencies in European populations. All the studies agree that the bubonic plague is probably not the source of selective pressure for CCR5-∆32. In refutation of this widely accepted hypothesis, each study attempts to create a new hypothesis and model that better explains the high frequency of CCR5-∆32 as well as its age estimate.

All of the five studies have some compelling evidence to support their hypothesis, but can a synthesis between all five unite them into a single hypothesis? It certainly may be possible that each of the hypotheses represents only a piece of the whole. Both Sabeti et al and Hedrick and Verrelli state that nothing can be conclusively ruled out given CCR5-∆32’s unique nature, despite its lack of uniqueness in terms of genetic diversity. Also, as CCR5-∆32 is a null allele that causes a loss in gene function, it would normally be subjected to purifying selection and removed from the population (Hedrick and Verrelli, 2006). CCR5-∆32 is, however, a unique null allele due to its selective advantage against HIV-1 although Sabeti et al found no evidence of positive selection before the emergence of HIV.

Assuming CCR5-∆32 is about 5075 years old as reported by Hedrick and Verrelli, the original selection for CCR5-∆32 predates both the plague and smallpox. Duncan et al mentioned examples of several episodes of plague epidemics prior to the Black Death. Assuming the pathogen of these plague epidemics up through the 1700s is a virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with 100% fatality, as suggested by Duncan et al, it is plausible that this plague may have provided the original selective pressure. Selection could have been further affected by ecological factors such as a cold climate that may have altered the selection from plague epidemics, as suggested by Balanovsky et al. In addition, if CCR5-∆32 originated in the Baltic Sea area, it could very well have been dispersed by Vikings, providing the initial north-sound gradient.

The intersection of the emergence of smallpox with the disappearance of the plague in Europe might have provided the required selective pressure to maintain CCR5-∆32 at high frequencies until the 20th century. The evidence cited by Duncan et al and Galvani and Slatkin, in which plague and smallpox persisted longer in northern European regions, could provide a means by which the north-sound gradient in CCR5-∆32 frequencies could have been sustained well after the Viking conquests.",74.34,56.58,57.3,23.81,21622
Biology,Report,Undergraduate,The Forgotten Tropical Ecosystem,"Aided by the mass media, environmental groups and their celebrity endorsers have rallied public support for campaigns to end the destruction of two beautiful tropical ecosystems, the rainforests and the coral reefs. Likely due to the aesthetic sensory overload that these biomes deliver, Save the Rainforest and Save the Reefs movements enjoy substantial social prominence, and their logos are seen everywhere from tee-shirts to Ben-and-Jerry’s ice-cream flavors. Meanwhile tropical mangrove forests, perhaps because their most abundant animal species are mud-dwelling crabs and the dominant plant-life consists of stubby trees, receive little attention, although the level of habitat degradation they experience is analogous to other tropical ecosystems. Virtually unnoticed by the public, approximately 35% of mangrove stands have been deforested since 1960. Already plant and animal communities have felt the direct consequences, and undoubtedly humans will soon.

Mangroves refer to the shrub-like trees of the Rhizophoraceae family that uniquely inhabit the tropical zone between the latitudes of 25° N and 30°S, where they grow on the narrow coastal fringes between estuaries and the sea. By virtue of their location, large portions of their trunk and buttress-like aboveground root systems are daily submerged in water for the hours of high tide. These areas also serve as mixing grounds for river and ocean water, and subsequently the nutrients and organisms derived from the two ecosystems that are picked up and carried by these currents. This unique and nutrient-rich habitat has evolved to form a highly productive and extensive ecosystem which is estimated to cover 18 million hectares of the globe (Bowen et al. 2001).

Scientists have classified 3 functional zones in every mangrove stand, which are each characterized by a different variety of mangrove. Fringe mangroves occupy tidal zones and therefore grow in full strength salt-water and daily receive the full brunt of the tides. Riverine mangroves grow along river banks and are flooded by freshwater and ocean currents. Basin mangroves grow behind the other zones and are less subject to tidal inundation. Because of this high water turnover mangrove forests teem with rich supplies of both land and sea-derived nutrients. Elevated levels of soil matrix aeration also arise due to constant mixing of river and sea currents. Several studies show that this aeration process results in the formation of a sponge-like soil complex which traps large quantities of sediment and nutrients. It follows that mangrove forests effectively intercept land-derived nutrients and pollutants and suspend them in the soil matrix, thereby preventing these compounds from reaching the ocean before being processed by nutrient-fixing bacteria. This cycle gives rise to a variety of different services, including high levels of nutrient processing and providing food for resident species. The services that mangroves provide are essential for preserving the integrity and biodiversity of this dynamic habitat. The diverse fauna that inhabit mangrove forests include: many fish and shellfish taxa, hundreds of species of birds, all sizes of reptiles, snakes, and even tigers (India) and manatees (Florida) (Bowen et al. 2001).

In addition to supporting resident animal species, mangrove forests also provide several invaluable services to neighboring ecosystems. The spongy soil matrix and thick mesh-like root systems of mangrove trees also prevent the tides from eroding the coastline. Furthermore, their mere presence impedes destructive floodwaters from approaching inland areas. Mangroves also serve as buffers against the powerful winds of tropical storms, thereby sheltering inland ecosystems and coastal developments. As previously mentioned, mangrove forests absorb large quantities of bio-hazardous compounds from land sources that seep into rivers through groundwater runoff, thereby preventing these compounds from damaging nearby marine ecosystems like seagrass beds and coral reefs. In addition, the viability of these delicate marine ecosystems may actually be dependent on mangrove forests’ high productivity (Bowen et al. 2001).

In their study of the link between mangrove forests and coral reef systems in the Caribbean, ecologist Peter Mumby and his colleagues discovered that large quantities of processed (i.e. digestible) organic material in the form of nutritive detritus are exported by mangrove forests via returning tides. Currents carry this detritus to local seagrass beds and coral reefs, where consumers have come to depend on their availability in order to feed. Mumby supports the hypothesis that coral reefs depend on the functionality of nearby mangrove forests by two key observations. First, per unit of biomass, mangrove forests have productivity levels similar to that of rainforests. Unlike rainforests, however, throughout the entire year mangrove forests maintain very low levels of leaf litter. Much of this detritus, Mumby determined, is washed out into the ocean, along with large amounts of nutrients. The second observation that supports the dependence hypothesis is that among the ten largest reefs in the Mesoamerican Coral Reef System (extending from Mexico to Belize) Mumby’s team observed that the reefs that were the largest and had the highest levels of biodiversity and productivity were those with the strongest links to coastal mangrove forests. The strength of the link between the two communities was determined by the reef’s proximity to the mangrove stand and the level of nutrient and organismal exchange between the two habitats (Arias-Gonzalez et al. 2004)

However, despite the numerous benefits that functional mangrove forests provide and the evident inter-connectedness between mangroves and neighboring biomes, the deforestation of mangrove forests for land development and aquaculture (i.e. fish and shrimp farms) reasons has steadily increased over the last forty years. Ecologists currently estimate that global mangrove forest cover has decreased by 35% since 1960. Their destruction poses real dangers to both human and non-humans alike. The interruption of food webs due to habitat destruction has already caused the local extinctions of several fish and crustacean species. Furthermore, research suggests mangrove deforestation is likely to affect the functionality of dependent reef ecosystems. Coasts become vulnerable to sediment washout and increased levels of shore erosion. Large scale eutrophication in coastal marine environments where substantial areas of mangrove coverage have been cleared has already occurred, as levels of nutrient and land contaminant inputs increase, and loads of unfiltered chemicals are exported into the ocean, provoking harmful algal blooms which leave large anoxic dead zones in their wakes. The potential negative impact to human societies is great, as land developments and coastal cities are left exposed to receding shore lines, flooding, and the violent winds of tropical storms (Kaly 1998).

Unfortunately, restoring devastated mangrove forests has proven difficult. Mangrove-based ecosystems are structurally complex, and have evolved over millennia around specific geographic components. For this reason, once a mangrove forest is cleared, restoring previous tidal patterns is difficult. This makes recreating and sustaining the salinity conditions to which previous mangroves and animal communities had acclimated also difficult. Finally, after a mangrove stand has been cleared for some time, the make-up of the soil (fundamental to ecosystem functionality) is irreparably altered. Presently, little work has been done to restore deforested mangrove stands. The majority of proposals to do so require the development of advanced biotechnologies. These efforts will undoubtedly go beyond the planting of several trees and may include: the reshaping of coastlines, chemical treatments to the soil, and purposeful reintroduction (in stages) of certain animal species (Farnsworth 1997).

Because of the obvious difficulties that mangrove forest restoration poses, conservation efforts are clearly the best option. If we want to save coral reefs (and coastal cities), we should invest in saving the mangroves.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,GENETIC ANALYSIS OF Drosophila melanogaster MUTANTS: TO DETERMINE INHERITANCE AND LINKAGE PATTERNS,"ABSTRACT:
Ore-R wild-type (+type) Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, phenotypically displays red-eyes, full wing venation (five longitudinal veins and two cross veins), and a tan body color. The true breeding culture U-5343, however, varies from this wild type with white eyes, terminating pre-margin longitudinal veins LII and LIV, and a black body color. Experimentation was undertaken to investigate these mutations. Through crossing with the Ore-R type, and three marker cultures of Drosophila (Marker I, Marker II and Marker III cultures) the genetic differences between the +type and U-5343 were determined to be the following: black-body color is controlled by one autosomal recessive gene (expressed symbolically as bb), located on autosome three, with the exact locus undeterminable; mutant wing venation is also a single autosomal recessive gene (tv) on autosome two, located at 3.8 mu; the white eye color is controlled by two autosomal recessive genes (a and b), both located on autosome two and interacting epistatically to generate three mutant eye colors: white (aabb), orange (a+_bb) and brown (aab+_). Gene a is located at 84.8 mu and gene b is located at 45.8 mu. This data was gathered via five initial crosses, followed by three F1 crosses and two male backcrosses. The specifics of these crosses are outlined below, but they will be distinguished as the follow: Cross A, Cross B, Cross I, Cross II, Cross III, F1xF1 of Cross A, F1xF1 of Cross B, F1xF1 of Cross I, Male Backcross II, and Male Backcross III. The genetic map of autosome two, including marker genes (Bl: bristle, L: Lobed, and Cy: Curly) was determined and is as follows:

INTRODUCTION:
Drosophila melanogaster, or the common fruit-fly, offers the geneticist a near perfect organism to explore the models of inheritance via simple, straight forward, cross breeding experiments. Short living - with a fast generation time - easy to handle and maintain in cultures and female only cross-over events, make D. melanogaster most desirable in the lab. As result much is known about the fruit flies genome; however, on occasion new mutations are discovered and experimentation is undertaken to determine the exact genes involved in these new mutants.

A true breeding culture of Drosophila, dubbed U-5343, is an example of such a scenario. The flies exhibit three genetically controlled novel phenotypic traits: black bodies, terminating pre-margin longitudinal veins LII and LIV, and white eyes. Ascertaining the nature of these mutations is an interesting problem and useful to the study of genetics in general. To answer questions, such as: what are modes of inheritance (dominant/recessive/sex-linked/autosomal); how many genes are involved; and, where are the genes located - cross breeding experimentation was undertaken. Specifically, five initial crosses and five secondary crosses were preformed in hopes of answering these questions.

Two of these initial crosses were reciprocal crosses. Cross A (unknown virgin female x +type male) and Cross B (+type virgin female x unknown male) were done to determine if the genes are recessive or dominate and sex-linked or autosomal. The secondary crosses, F1xF1 of Cross A and F1xF1 of Cross B, were done to determine: the number of genes controlling the trait; these genes interaction, if multiple present; the segregation ratios for each gene; independent assortment between genes, by a χ2 test; and, the map distances between linked genes. Answering these questions was accomplished by scoring flies of both F1 and F2 generations of the two crosses.

Cross I (unknown virgin females x M-I males) and F1xF1 of Cross I were done to determine the relationship between the genes and the X-chromosome. The specifics of the marker type can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section, however, these crosses were potentially helpful to determine if the genes are on the X-chromosome and, if yes, where they are located. Again, scoring F1 and F2 flies could be used to determine the loci of the genes on X-chromosome - it was important here to record gender in this scoring. However, if no genes are found on the X-chromosome (based on the results of Crosses A and B), then simply scoring F2 flies would be helpful to later determine the map distance between linked genes not on the X-chromosome. This is possible because if the genes are not sex-linked, then ignoring the secondary marker characteristics of the F2 would make them functionally the same as the F2's of cross A and B - since then they become equivalent to the wild-type flies.

Finally, the Crosses II and III were done to determine where the genes were located in regards to the second and third autosome, with autosomal specific traits. Specifics of these marker types and their phenotypic expression can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS. In brief, however, these initial crosses, when scored would help show only if the mutant genes were dominant or recessive. A secondary backcross of the male progeny of these crosses with unknown virgin females was necessary to determine which chromosome the genes were on. Notably absent for all the crosses described here is an emphasis on autosome IV; since this autosome is so small it is not likely that these mutations' loci are there.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
The crosses and scoring were done over a series of seven weeks and all flies for all crosses were grown at 24° C. All flies were anesthetized using CO2 and inspected under a dissecting or stereoscopic microscope while on CO2 pads. The average time sedated was minimized to prevent sterility. Flies were handled with small brushes and prodding needles; for specifics on fly handling please see Jeyabalan (2005).

In total five different cultures of flies were used: Oregon-R (Ore-R) type wilds, unknown culture U-5343, and marker stocks labeled M-I, M-II, M-III. Two Ore-R stocks and eight mutant stocks were initially provided. Two new cultures of U-5343 were made during the experiment to maintain the stock for later backcrosses. There was continuous access to all marker stocks. Wild-type flies were phenotypically described as: tan bodied, red eyed, full wing venation with straight wings, and normal straight bristles. U-5343 flies were observed to be black bodied with white eyes and lacked a complete LII and LIV longitudinal veins (failing to reach margin); they were wild-type for all marker genes. M-I flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: crossvienless (cv - X-chromosome @ 13.7) and forked, shortened bristles (f - X-chromosome @ 56.7). M-II flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: short-thin bristles (Bl - autosome II @ 54.8), small 'lobed' eyes (L - autosome II @ 72.0), and with curled wings (Cy - autosome II @ 6.1). M-II was a balanced-lethal culture so all flies showed a Bl L/Cy genotype. M-III flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: small 'smooth' eyes (Gl - autosome III @ 41.4) and short blunt bristles (Sb - autosome III @ 58.2) with the inversion known as LVM present (autosome III lethal balancing inversion), a non-phenotypically expressed trait. Again, M-III was a balanced-lethal culture so all flies showed a Gl Sb/LVM genotype. All cultures were true breeding. For more details about mark stocks and traits see Jeyabalan (2005)

Concerning the crosses in general, when virgin females were needed all flies were removed from source bottle and, then, 6-8 hours later virgin females were harvested. For all crosses parent flies were removed from bottles 8-10 days after the cross and all flies were scored 14-20 days after the cross. All crosses were done in duplicate unless otherwise indicated. When scoring, body color, eye color, wing venation, sex, and relevant marker traits were all recorded. See appendix (skeletal report) for scoring data table structure.

Cross A: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross A. F2 flies were scored.

Cross B: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross B. F2 flies were scored.

Marker Cross I: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-I males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross I. F2 flies were scored.

Marker Cross II: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-II type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Bl L/Cy+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - a male backcross. Cross was not done in duplicate. Additionally, Bl+ L+/Cy male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - not done in duplicate. The first cross yielded offspring which were scored. The second cross yielded no offspring, so no flies were scored.

Marker Cross III: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-III type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Gl Sb/LVM+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females - a male backcross. The male backcross progeny were scored.

After all the data was collected, the unneeded flies were euthanized and discarded in a humane fashion.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
In general, all but one of the crosses went as expected and there were no major problems with determining the nature of the genes involved in the U-5343 mutant culture. In the analysis below, to find any χ2 calculations please see appendix (calculations); also, please see appendix (skeletal report) for raw data tables.

Crosses A and B:

Table 1: Cross A, F1

Table here
Table 2: Cross B, F1

Table here
These two tables are very revealing: first, since these crosses were reciprocal and there is no significant differences between male and female expressed phenotype, it is most likely that all mutations are autosomal in nature. Secondly, since no mutant types are present in any flies, it should be that the mutations are all recessive. These conclusions can only be drawn, however, because it was given that the unknowns were true-breeding homozygous mutants. Further analysis of the F2 generation helps confirm these initial observations.

Qualitatively, in the F2 generation, mutant wing venation and normal wing venation were both observed. Additionally, mutant body color and wild-type body color were observed. However, four eye colors were observed: red, white, orange and brown - suggesting that more then one mutant gene is affecting eye color.

The organized data of the F2 crosses are presented in Tables 3-6. These tables combine both Cross A with B, and ignores gender; there should be no differences in the F2 sexes where the genes are autosomal recessive. These tables were compiled from the raw data tables present in the appendix. Table 3 establishes the segregation pattern of the body color gene. The χ2 here is .606 (0.455 < χ2 < 2.706 for 1 df), thus 0.1 < p < .5. This confirms proper segregation of the blackbody mutant color - supporting the null hypothesis. The gene, then, for the black body color is bb. Table 4 verifies the segregation pattern of the wing venation mutation gene. The χ2 here is 1.87 (again, 0.455 < χ2 < 2.706 for 1 df), thus 0.1 < p < .5. This suggest proper segregation of the wing venation mutation - again, supporting the null hypothesis. The gene, then, for the mutant wing venation is tv. Table 5 helps determine the relationship between these two genes, tv and bb. Assuming a null of independent assortment, a χ2 test reveals a value of 3.45 (2.366 < χ2 < 6.251 for 3 df), yielding 0.1 < p < 0.5. Thus, one cannot reject the null hypothesis of independent assortment, signifying that no linkage exists between these two genes and they are on different autosomes.

Table here
Table here
Table here
Finally, Table 6 explores the assortment of the two eye color genes. Qualitative observation suggests that two genes - a and b - interact epistatically to control eye color, thereby, producing four observed eye color possibilities: white (aabb), orange (a+_bb), brown (aab+_), and wild-type red (a+_b+_). To test for assortment, the χ2 for the eye color genes based on cross A and B combined was calculated at 87.59, giving a p < .005 for 3 df of freedom. This a significant deviation from the expected results, implying that the two genes are indeed linked. Furthermore, here the orange and brown types represent a recombination event, allowing for the calculation1 of a mapping distance between the two genes at 37.4 mu.

Table here
Male Parent Backcross:
Observations of the male parent backcross help to reveal the autosome associated with the mutant genes. As aforementioned, the two marker crosses represent a balanced lethal system, where heterozygosity is maintained, even in the face of crossing over. With such marker systems, one can easily determine the autosome upon which an unknown mutation lies. Backcrossing the males (hybrid M-II, or M-III, and unknown flies) with the unknown female culture produces male backcross progeny. If the recessive mutation(s) is linked to the markers, then it will not show-up with the marker phenotype in the male back cross progeny - since crossing over does not occur in the male Drosophila. Alternatively, if the recessive mutation(s) does show up with the marker type, then it must be independently assorting and, therefore, on a different autosome than the marker.

For the male backcross progeny observed here, compelling results allow for autosomal assignment of all mutant genes. M-II backcross progeny were observed phenotypically as bristle, lobed, and black bodied - showing that the body color is not on the second autosome, but on the third. Also, neither the wing mutation nor the eye color mutation were present with the markers in the M-II backcross progeny, implying their presence on the second autosome. However, the curly-type backcross did not produce any viable offspring; most likely because balanced lethal systems often create very fragile males, easily sterilized by overexposure to CO2. Nevertheless, the M-III backcross showed glued, stubbled, white-eyed, wing mutant flies, confirming the presence of these three mutant genes (a, b, and tv) on the second autosome and supporting the results of the successful M-II backcross. Additionally, the mutant body color did not show up with the marker phenotypes, also corroborating the assignment of this gene to the third autosome.

In summary then, the mutant genes a, b, and tv are on the second autosome and the mutant gene bb is on the third autosome. Thus, using a three point cross and the combined data of the F2 progeny from crosses A, B, and M-I, one can complete2 the map of autosome two, by determining the mutant positions. However, from these experiments, the map of autosome three cannot be completed; though, a female parent back cross of M-III would allow for the missing mapping data to be scored.

Cross I:
As all other crosses have indicated, no unknown mutations are present on the X-chromosome. This, however, does not mean that the M-I cross was done in vain - by ignoring the marker phenotypes, the M-I cross effectively becomes the same as the A/B crosses. Thus, by combining all of these crosses (table 7), a robust data set is created where a three point cross can determine the map distances between a, b, and tv. From the table then:

a-b = (46+65+50+27)*2/975 = .386 or 38.6 mu

(note: this is very close to the previous estimate of 37.4 from Cross A/B alone)

a-tv = (46+65+46+88+50+27+46+27)*2/975 = .810 or 81.1 mu

b-tv = (46+88+46+27)*2/975 = .420 or 42.0 mu

Table here
From these map points, we see that the proper gene order is tv-b-a and we can now map the autosome. The mutation tv is was given at 3.8 mu. Therefore, b is 3.8+42.0 = 45.8 mu and a is 3.8+81 = 84.8. The map, with all marker genes included, is represented by image 1:

SUMMARY:
Through well thought-out cross breeding experiments, the previously unknown genetic components of a true breeding Drosophila m. culture (U-5342) was determined. In all, four new genes were discovered and described, in brief, that control body color, wing venation, and eye color. The gene bb (black body) is autosomal recessive and located on the third autosome; further tests are needed to establish the exact location. The genes a and b epistatically controlling eye-color, they are linkage with a distance of about 38.6 mu. They express themselves in four ways phenotypically, red (a+_bb), orange (a+_bb), brown (aab+_) and white (aabb). And are mapped at the locations in the figure above. Finally, the gene tv (pre-terminating LII and LIV longitudinal veins) is autosomal recessive and on the second chromosome, also mapped above with a and b.",0,0,0,0.63,16891
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Lab 3: Plant Competition,"Introduction
The ability of a species to compete for limited resources is often central to its ability to survive in a given environment. Different species possess differential competitive abilities, which are often dependent upon environmental conditions. For all organisms, the effects of competition become more pronounced with an increase in density because more organisms are searching for resources in the same areas, depleting the resources to continually lower levels.

One way that plants gain a competitive edge is by forming mutualistic relationships with other organisms, thereby working together to promote mutual survival. Rhizobium bacteria have a symbiotic relationship with the roots of legumes in which they fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plant in exchange for resources such as carbon (Begon, et al., 2003).

In this experiment we examined how the presence of Rhizobium affected the competitive ability of red clover (Trifolium pretense) which is a legume, when grown with red fescue (Festuca rubra) which is not leguminous. We hypothesized that Rhizobium form a mutualistic relationship with legumes and provide it with nitrogen, and from this we predicted that red clover would compete better against red fescue (a grass) in environments with Rhizobium present.

Results
Our results did not indicate a difference in competitive ability of red fescue in the presence or absence of Rhizobium. This is illustrated by the fact that the confidence intervals in the linear regression graphs are broadly overlapping (Figure 1). The R squared values for the Rhizobium and no Rhizobium treatments of .810 and .778 respectively indicate that the best fit lines in the graph are accurate representations of our data. The p-values of .038 and .048 for the R square data indicate that it is statistically significant, which means there is a significant relationship between target weight and neighbor density and hence that competition is occurring.

Discussion
Our results did not support our prediction that red clover would compete better in the presence of Rhizobium. One explanation for this is the possibility that we made some incorrect assumptions as part of our experimental model. One important assumption we made was that nitrogen was a limiting resource which both plant species were competing for, which in reality may or may not have been the case. The nitrogen concentration may have been high enough in the soil that the additional nitrogen provided by the Rhizobium did not provide any appreciable advantage to the red clover. If this were the case, then the Rhizobium may have actually hurt the clover's competitive ability by taking its resources without providing necessary nutrients in exchange. If we were able to do the experiment again, it would be helpful to test the nitrogen content of the soil to ensure that it is in fact a limiting resource.

Another important assumption we made was that red clover and red fescue shared the same traits apart from clover being a legume and fescue a grass. However, there is one other difference in that red clover is a dicot while red fescue is a monocot. Physiological differences, particularly in the root system, suggest that dicots are better at absorbing nutrients from the soil than monocots. Although this would imply that clover is still a better competitor, it is possible that there are other confounding factors which gave the fescue a similar competitive effect in the presence and absence of Rhizobium.

A more practical aspect of our experimental design that could be problematic is that we looked at the biomass of the part of the plant above the ground only, by clipping it at ground level and then weighing it. If the effects of competition led one plant species or the other to divert more resources to the roots and away from stems and leaves, our data could be misleading.

One other potential problem exists with our model in that it does not account for the proximity of plants to each other. While it is a logical assumption that with increasing density, proximity of plants increases, it is possible that in low density plots, seeds of competitors by chance happened to fall very close to the target seeds. The closer the plants are physically, the more their resource utilization areas overlap, and the stronger the effects of competition between them.

Aside from the aforementioned problems with the assumptions of our model, the additive design of our experiment seems to be the best way to examine competition between species. An additional experiment we could have performed is a replacement series in which the proportion of the two species is varied while keeping the total plant density the same. The problem with this approach is that it is impossible to distinguish between intra- and interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003). Since for this experiment we are looking specifically at the interspecific competitive effects, the additive design is the better approach.

Examining the competitive effects and responses of various plant species to interactions with other species has particular relevance to ecologists or conservation biologists trying to manipulate species composition. Over the long term, it would seem that competitive response is more important to a plant's ability to persist at a site. Unless the plant is the top competitor in an ecosystem, it is likely that with time other species which are good competitors will begin to grow at the same site and deplete the resource base to low levels. In order to persist, the plant will have to be tolerant of low resource levels; otherwise it will be outcompeted by plant species which are better able to absorb resources from the environment.

Although some plants that have a strong competitive effect also have a strong competitive response, the two do not necessarily go together. It is possible that a plant which has a strong competitive effect is good at hoarding resources at a particular site and simply survives by preventing other species from establishing there.

This experimental model also has relevance to the Lotka-Volterra model for competition. In order to test whether stable coexistence can occur (the effects of intraspecific competition are greater than interspecific), we would have to do an additional experiment in which the target and neighbor species were switched, because the current set-up only determines the effect of fescue on clover and not vice-versa. With data from both density experiments there are equations which make it possible to sort out the effects of intra- vs. interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003).

Establishing the effects of plant species interactions has a lot of implications for farming (weed-crop competition), plant conservation and the management of invasive species. By understanding how different environmental conditions affect these interactions, ecologists will be better able to use this knowledge to their advantage in creating environments which allow for a particular target species to have the greatest competitive advantage.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,The Effects of Motor Oil on Aquatic Insect Predation,"Abstract: Modern technology and urbanization have brought about some important consequences for freshwater ecosystems. Urban run-off has carried a number of new pollutants, including motor oil and other petroleum products, into urban and suburban ponds, streams and rivers. To date, not much investigation has been carried out in regards to the effects of this oil pollution on freshwater organisms. In this experiment I investigated the effects of different concentrations of motor oil on dragonfly nymph activity and dragonfly consumption of damselfly nymphs in laboratory microcosms. The activity level and predation rate was monitored in four different concentrations of motor oil (.1%, .5%, 1%, 2%) as well as in a control. Results indicated a significant relationship between predation rate and oil concentration, but no correlation was found between dragonfly activity level and oil concentration. These results have implications for maintenance of aquatic species diversity as well as trophic interactions beyond the aquatic system, as both dragonfly and damselfly nymphs are important predator and prey items in aquatic food webs.

Introduction
Pollution of aquatic environments by petroleum products is an issue of concern to many ecologists and environmentalists. While it receives a lot of attention after major commercial oil spills, this is not in fact the primary source of oil pollution. According to a report by the National Academies' National Research council, 29 million gallons of petroleum products enter North American waters annually from anthropogenic sources, 85% of which is from land runoff, oil-contaminated rivers, airplanes and small watercraft. All this is in addition to the 47 million gallons that naturally seep into waters through the ocean floor (Coleman, et al., 2003).

Petroleum products can have several negative consequences for aquatic ecosystems. The major constituents of petroleum products are complex hydrocarbons, comprising 80-90% of unused motor oil (Irwin, et al., 1997). Of all these hydrocarbon groups, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought have the most toxic effects, as they attach easily to sediment surfaces and are relatively resistant to degradation (Vo, et al., 2004). Oil slicks formed at the surface can potentially limit oxygen exchange at the water-air boundary, decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. Oil at the surface also has the potential to coat the gills of aquatic organisms, adversely affecting respiration (Bhattacharyya, et al., 2003).

Not many studies have been done to investigate the effects of oil pollution on freshwater systems, as most large-scale oil spills occur in marine environments. However, studies on the effects of the more general category of freshwater pollutants, which include oils/grease, but also heavy metals and other toxic pollutants, have been done. In fact, aquatic insects are often used as an indicator of water quality, a concept known as biomonitoring. Benthic invertebrates are the most frequently used organisms in biomonitoring, as they are a diverse group of organisms which exhibit varying degrees of tolerance to environmental conditions (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Insects of the order Odonata, which includes damselflies and dragonflies, are known to be moderately sensitive to environmental pollutants, and their absence from a particular habitat is frequently indicative of poor water quality. In an experiment investigating the effects of urban runoff on stream water quality, benthic organisms were surveyed upstream and downstream of an urban development. The prevalence of dragonflies was found to be significantly higher at upstream sites (22%) than at downstream sites (4%). It was concluded that this was a result of pollution and eutrophication decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the stream sites downstream of the development (DeBarruel and West, 2003).

Odonates are particularly sensitive to dissolved oxygen levels. According to Merritt and Cummings (1996) a major challenge for any aquatic insect is to obtain sufficient quantities of oxygen for its metabolic needs (36). For dragonflies and damselflies this is particularly true due to their closed tracheal systems; rather than obtaining oxygen through direct contact with air, their tracheal gills uptake oxygen dissolved in the water (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Therefore any circumstance which decreases dissolved oxygen levels has negative repercussions for dragonfly and damselfly respiration.

For this experiment, I set up a laboratory system to investigate the effects of different concentrations of motor oil on dragonfly nymphs and their predatory interactions with damselfly nymphs. The dependence of dragonflies and damselflies on relatively high levels of dissolved oxygen, and oil's effects on dissolved oxygen concentration led me to hypothesize that adding motor oil to simulated pond environments would affect activity levels in dragonflies. I predicted that an increase in concentration of motor oil would lead to lower activity levels in dragonflies.

The activity levels of both dragonflies and damselflies have implications for predation. Both dragonflies and damselflies are predatory insects, but presumably due to size advantage, dragonflies prey on damselflies and not vice-versa. Dragonflies are generally ambush predators, waiting for prey to approach before attacking, but will occasionally switch to a more active foraging strategy if food availability is low (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). They rely primarily on tactile cues in searching for prey but also take advantage of visual cues (Resh and Rosenberg, 1984).

As a corollary to my first hypothesis, I hypothesized that the addition of oil to the environments would have an effect on predation rates. A decrease in activity of damselflies (prey) would result in fewer visual cues for dragonflies and a decrease in activity level of dragonflies would lead to less active foraging behavior. Therefore, I predicted a negative correlation between oil concentration and number of prey eaten.

Materials and Methods
I set up five clear plastic containers and filled each with 2 liters of pond water in an attempt to most effectively simulate a natural freshwater habitat. The first container was a control with no oil added, and the four successive containers were contaminated with increasing concentrations of unused motor oil (.1%, .5%, 1% and 2%). I collected dragonfly and damselfly nymphs from Willow Pond at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, and added one dragonfly predator to each container along with multiple damselfly prey. I performed two replicates of the experiment; two damselflies were placed with each dragonfly in the first replicate and six damselflies in the second. [Note: I misidentified several of the prey items I added to the containers in the 2nd replicate, meaning that some containers contained a mixture of mayflies and damselflies. However, I don't believe this should have an effect on the experiment as both are preyed upon by dragonfly nymphs].

After placing the insects in the containers, I collected data on their activity level by tracking their movement at ten minute intervals. Every ten minutes I marked the approximate location of the dragonfly and then noted whether it moved from that spot in the following time interval. I collected activity data a second time after the insects had been exposed to the oil for five days. During each collection I recorded data for five time intervals.

In order to determine the predation rate, I counted the number of surviving damselflies after five days and then determined the number of prey eaten. I divided this by the initial number of prey items in order to determine the percentage of prey eaten. I used percentage of prey eaten rather than number of prey eaten to standardize the measurements for the two replicates, since they had different initial numbers of prey. Because I wanted to determine how a range of concentrations affected percentage of prey eaten, I performed a linear regression on the data.

Results
The graph of the linear regression examining the relationship between oil concentration and dragonfly activity showed a very weak negative correlation between the two variables (Figure 2). The very low R squared value (.034) reveals that the best fit line is not an accurate reflection of the data at all. Furthermore, the p-value is well over .05 (.612) meaning that the slope is not significantly different from zero.

The graph of the linear regression relating percentage of prey eaten to oil concentration showed an overall negative correlation (slope = -.378) (Figure 1). The standard error measurement for the slope is relatively high as there are many data points which are quite far from the line. The R squared value of .527 indicates that the best fit line is a satisfactory representation of the data but is not exceptionally accurate. The low p-value (.017) denotes a significant relationship between the two variables.

Discussion
The results do not support my first prediction of a negative correlation between oil concentration and dragonfly activity. The high p-value suggests that the activity data are a result of random chance and hence no significant relationship exists between the two variables. There are several possible explanations for this. First of all, more data would be necessary to make any solid conclusions about the activity level of dragonfly nymphs. With such a small sample size (four data points in two replicates) results are unlikely to show concrete trends, as any outliers have a significant effect. Secondly, dragonfly nymphs may not be particularly active organisms in general, as they are sit and wait predators and do not resort to active foraging unless it becomes necessary for survival (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). Lastly, activity measurements were taken during the day, while dragonflies tend to be more active at night as an avoidance mechanism from predation by fish and other aquatic organisms (Merritt and Cummins, 1996). Taking more activity data over a longer period of time, with some collections being done at night would likely provide a clearer picture of the relationship between oil pollution and activity levels.

It would have been helpful to measure the dissolved oxygen levels in the different environments, as the whole notion of the decreased activity levels was predicated on the notion that surface oil inhibits diffusion of oxygen through the water. Some studies suggest that it takes several months of exposure to oil before a measurable difference in oxygen concentration is detectable. Harrel (1985) studied the effects of an oil spill in a Texas stream, comparing the water quality of the contaminated stream with that of a nearby control stream. Four days after the initial oil spill, oil was visible on the water surface and there was a strong smell of hydrocarbons, but measurements of water quality did not differ much between the two streams. Not until six months later were decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration apparent (Harrel, 1985). If this were the case in our system, then no difference in activity levels would be expected after only five days.

Though prediction 1 was not supported, prediction 2, regarding the relationship between oil concentration and predation rate, was supported. The regression line showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the two variables. The reasons for these results are not entirely clear, however, nor are the results free of statistical flaws. One of the biggest statistical problems I encountered was due to the fact that I had different numbers of initial prey items in the two replications. While I tried to standardize the predation measurements by examining the percentage of prey eaten as opposed to the number of prey eaten, this did not completely solve the problem, because there was not a continuous range of possible values for the percentage. For the first replicate, because there were only two prey, there were only three incremental possibilities for predation percentage, 0%, 50% and 100% while in the 2nd replicate there was a broader yet still incremental range (0, 1/6, 1/3, ½, etc). Statistically it would have been far better to have six initial prey items in both replicates.

While my initial hypothesis that decreased oxygen levels would lead to less active foraging behavior from the dragonflies and fewer movements (i.e. visual cues) by the damselfly may still hold, it is called into question by the failure of prediction 1. An alternative possibility is that the thick, opaque film formed on the top of the water blocked a large portion of the incoming light and made it more difficult for the dragonflies to clearly see prey. It is also possible that ingestion of toxic water-soluble components of oil led to changes in the predator's ability to search for or attack prey.

There is a compelling possibility that the number of prey eaten was more strongly correlated to predator size than to concentration of oil. I did not take quantitative data on predator size, but based on my observations, those predators that ate the largest percentage of prey also tended to be the largest of the predator group. This makes logical sense as large predators have higher energy needs and need to consume more prey in order to satisfy those needs. The size of predators and prey was not a factor that was controlled for and may have had a significant impact on the results.

A second factor which was not controlled for but could have affected the results was the presence of secondary food sources. It was assumed that in this environment dragonfly nymphs would prey exclusively upon damselfly nymphs; however, dragonflies are generalists and will consume anything small enough for them to handle. Since pond water was used in the experiment, small prey items such as Daphnia and midges were present in unknown quantities, because their small size made them impossible to filter out. Smaller dragonflies may have preferred to go after these smaller prey items in lieu of damselflies, violating the underlying assumption of the experiment.

Future versions of this experiment could be improved by using larger sample sizes and taking more measurements over a longer time period. It would be interesting to include the size of the predator as one experimental factor by measuring either the weight or length of the dragonflies, and examine the interactions between size and oil concentration, and how that effects predation rate, determining which factor seems to have the greatest effect. Also, future experimenters would ideally find a way to ensure that damselflies were the only food resource available to dragonflies.

The results of this experiment have implications for those trying to maintain a species balance within aquatic ecosystems. If oil concentration does directly affect predation (in addition to other factors like size) it is important to put forth greater efforts to reduce oil pollution coming into ponds and rivers from everyday sources such as road run-off. Dragonfly and damselfly nymphs both play key roles in aquatic food webs both as predators and as prey. By changing predatory behavior and species composition at one trophic level, oil pollution has the potential to radiate throughout the food web, causing indirect effects up to the human level.",0,24.89,31.47,25.05,15449
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Comparison of Hypothesis Testing in a High vs. Low-impact Journal,"Introduction
The development of a testable hypothesis is an important part of the scientific method and is a key characteristic of good science. Hypotheses help to define the focus of research and create experiments that can provide answers to meaningful questions. Without well-defined hypotheses researchers run the risk of making erroneous conclusions from data that was not collected in an experiment appropriately designed to test for those conclusions.

In this study I examined the difference in frequency of hypothesis testing between two journals. I hypothesized that the best quality journals would be most selective in accepting submissions and therefore would be most likely to publish articles which strongly adhere to the scientific method. I predicted that the highest quality journals would have more articles with a clearly defined hypothesis than lower quality journals.

As a quantitative measure of journal quality I used the journal impact factor which is defined by ISI as, a measure of the frequency with which the 'average article' in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period (Thomson Scientific website). The rating is calculated by dividing the number of times articles from the previous two years in the journal were cited in the current year by the total number of articles published in the previous two years. The use of the journal impact factor as an indicator of journal quality is controversial in the scientific community, as a number of concerns have been raised about it; however, for the purposes of this study it provides the best objective and quantifiable measure of quality.

Methods
In order to test my prediction that articles from higher-impact journals would have clearer a priori hypotheses, I examined five articles from each of two different journals. For the high-impact journal I selected Ecology, which is in the top ten of ecology journals with an impact factor of 3.7. As a comparatively lower-impact journal I selected Plant Ecology, with an impact factor of 1.28. Articles were selected based on time of publication (2000-2005 only) and subject matter (invasive plant species).

In evaluating each article based on the clarity of the hypothesis, I assigned each article a rating from 1 to 3. A rating of three is indicative of an indisputably clear hypothesis stated in the article abstract or introduction. A two signifies that some background theory and research questions were addressed, but no specific hypotheses were provided. A rating of one designates those articles that did not have any indication of a hypothesis being tested.

Results
Table here
Table 1 shows the ratings I assigned to each article as a quantification of the clarity of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment. Articles are numbered according to the order that they are presented in the literature cited section at the end. All five articles in the journal Ecology received the highest rating, indicative of clear hypotheses unambiguously stated in the article's introduction. Hypothesis testing in Plant Ecology varied from 1-3.

Discussion
The data appear to support the hypothesis and prediction, as all articles from the high-impact journal had clearly stated hypotheses compared with only two from the lower-impact journal. Admittedly, this is not a conclusive finding as the sample size used was quite small and the ranking system was not completely objective or scientific.

For the articles given a rating of 3, hypotheses were explicitly stated, generally in the form we hypothesized that… or the typical if…then format. All of these articles addressed their hypothesis in the discussion, stating whether it was supported or contradicted. In all cases where the results were inconsistent with the hypothesis, alternatives hypotheses were proposed along with ideas for future investigation into the a posteriori hypothesis.

The article that received a two (article 7) listed a series of questions the study was designed to address but did not suggest an answer to any of these questions a priori. In the discussion at the end, the authors addressed each question individually and proposed several a posteriori hypotheses based on the data they collected. Interestingly, this illustrated some of the problems associated with this style of experimentation. The authors acknowledged that they were unable to provide an answer to their first question because their experimental design was unsuitable for doing so. Similarly, few concrete answers were found for the subsequent questions as the authors were primarily only able to provide speculation based on data and observations. Had they designed experiments to test specific a priori hypotheses, perhaps they would have been able to make more definitive conclusions.

The two articles that received a rating of one broadly defined the aims of their experiment but did not narrow the scope enough by providing a specific hypothesis. The introductions of article 10 and article 8 explained what they hoped to determine as a result of the experiment but did not provide any predictions or indicate any expected results. Both papers were more exploratory in nature but both achieved results which seemed to satisfy the objective of their study.

All papers seemed to be logical and well-organized, partly due to the fact that all scientific papers follow a similar format: abstract followed by introduction, materials and methods, and so on. This essentially forces the author(s) to structure the paper in a way that is logical for the reader. The only way in which the presentation of papers might be improved is by making a more explicit connection between a hypothesis and the experiment designed to test that hypothesis. When papers have multiple hypotheses in the introduction and multiple tests described in the methods section, it would be helpful to know which test was done specifically to address a particular hypothesis.

Hypothesis testing has always been presented as a cornerstone of science so it is surprising that a significant number of science articles are being published without clear hypotheses. The results of this study suggests that there is a possible positive correlation between a journal's impact factor and hypothesis testing within its articles, though more study needs to be done. In order to test this hypothesis more thoroughly it would be important to use larger sample sizes and select articles from additional publications with both high and low impact factors.",30.32,61.02,31.3,33.86,6507
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Drosophila Lab Report,"Introduction
Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal genetic model organism in several respects. Because of its small size it is easily manipulated, its short life cycle allows for genetic analysis over several generations in a short period of time, its few chromosomes simplify genetic analysis, and previous researchers have already identified and mapped many mutations. The overall purpose for this experiment was to map unknown heritable mutations in Drosophila to their chromosomal locations. The main hypothesis was that the three mutant traits, dark body color, white eye, and short longitudinal veins, were being inherited in a normal autosomal recessive pattern. Specifically, our aims were to cross unknown Drosophila stock to Oregon-R and to Marker flies, with previously mapped chromosomal mutations, to determine for each mutant trait the method of inheritance and the chromosomal location. Specific hypotheses are: that genes for body color are segregating normally, genes for wing venation are segregating normally, body color and wing venation genes are independently assorting, two genes determine eye color, the two eye color genes are independently assorting, and the eye color genes are linked to the body color gene.

Discussion
Crosses A&B
Crosses A and B were set up as reciprocal crosses in order to determine whether the unknown mutations were autosomal or sex-linked and dominant or recessive. From the Cross A - F1 results (Table 1), we conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive, because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, and autosomal, because the F1 males appear wild type. If any of the mutations had been sex-linked, F1 males would have received a mutant gene from the P female and a Y chromosome from the P male and would have presented a mutant phenotype. From the Cross B - F1 results (Table 3), we also conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, but we cannot determine whether the mutations are autosomal. If all the mutations were autosomal, F1 progeny would have one mutant and one wild type copy of each gene and a wild type phenotype. If any of the mutations were sex-linked, they still would not show up in the F1 progeny because the females would have one X chromosome with a wild type copy of the genes, giving it a wild type phenotype, and the males would only have a wild type copy of the mutant genes on their X chromosome from the P female. However, since the reciprocal crosses produced the same results, we can conclude that the mutations are autosomal.

If genes for body color are segregating normally as hypothesized, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type body color to mutant body color of 3:1. Based on the combined F2 results of A and B, we observed a ratio of 3.4:1 (Table 10). The X2 value for these results is 1.39, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce that the mutant body color gene is segregating normally. A 3:1 phenotypic ratio corresponds to an autosomal recessive trait so we conclude that the body color gene is autosomal recessive. With the null hypothesis that genes for wing venation are segregating normally, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type wing venation to mutant wing venation of 3:1. From the combined F2 results of A and B (Table 11), we observed a ratio of 3.5:1. The X2 value for these results is 2.25, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and by the same reasoning as above, we deduce that the wing venation gene is autosomal recessive. We next hypothesized that body color gene and wing venation gene were assorting independently. With this hypothesis we expect a ratio for wild type body color and wild type wing venation: mutant body color and wild type wing venation: wild type body color and mutant wing venation: mutant body color and mutant wing venation of 11.9:3.5:3.4:1 (Table 12). We observed a ratio of 13.2:4.0:3.9:1.0; the X2 value for this set of data is 0.24, corresponding to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce with that body color and wing venation are assorting independently.

We observed red, brown, orange, and white eyes in a ratio close to 6:1:1:1 in the F2 progeny (Table 6). Based on this we propose that two genes (orange eyes, a, and brown eyes, b) are involved in the expression of eye color, because with the simplifying assumption that each mutant gene has two alleles, at least two genes are needed to produce four phenotypes. Our hypothesis of interaction is a parallel pathway where at least one wild type copy of each gene is needed to produce the wild type red eye (Fig. 1). Our null hypothesis for their association is that they are independently assorting. This gives a X2 value of 61, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05 and a strong rejection of the hypothesis. Therefore the two genes for eye color are linked. F1 progeny were all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 45.4 map units apart.

Overall the data from F1 and F2 of Crosses A and B did not present any problems and from it we concluded that the three mutant traits have a high probability of being autosomal, body color and wing venation have a high probability of assorting independently, and it is highly probable that two linked genes control eye color.

Male Parent Backcross: Crosses II and III
Crosses II and III were set up with unknown flies crossed with Marker II and Marker III stocks respectively. Marker II and Marker III stocks serve as chromosomal markers because they carry dominant homozygous lethal mutations. Marker II has mutant alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a wild type allele of the Curly gene on one copy of chromosome II and wild type alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a mutant allele of the Curly gene on the other copy. Because these three mutations are dominant, these flies should present short bristles, curly wings, and small lobed eyes but the bristle phenotype does not show up in the Marker II flies we have. Marker III has mutant alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a wild type allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on one copy of chromosome III and wild type alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a mutant allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on the other copy. As these three mutations are dominant, Marker III flies have small, smooth eyes and short blunt stubbles (LVM has no mutant phenotype). Both marker stocks are true-breeding because any progeny that do not have the same genotype as the parents lethally receive two copies of at least one mutation (Fig. 2).

In order to map body color and wing venation genes to chromosomes, we set up F1 male backcrosses for Crosses II and III. In a F1 male backcross, F1 males showing a marker phenotype are crossed to unknown females. In the backcross progeny, if an unknown mutant trait shows up with a marker, then the mutant trait and marker are on different chromosomes; if they do not show up together, they are on the same chromosome. For Cross II - F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color shows up with both Bristle Lobed and Curly markers, indicating that the body color gene is not on chromosome II with them (Table 7). Mutant wing venation never shows up with Bristle Lobed or Curly, indicating the wing venation gene is on the chromosome II with those markers. For Cross III F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color does not show up with Glued Stubble markers, indicating the body color gene is also on chromosome III (Table 8). Mutant wing venation does show up with the Glued Stubble markers, indicating that the wing venation gene is not on chromosome III. There is one exception of a dark bodied, Glued Stubble fly, but as it is only one fly, this is probably due to human scoring error or the presence of a random fly from the lab during scoring.

Overall the Cross II and III F1 and male F1 backcross data strongly support the conclusion that body color gene is on the chromosome III and wing venation gene is on chromosome II.

Cross I
We set up Cross I between unknown virgin females and crossveinless forked Marker I males and carried the cross through the F2 generation. In the F1 generation we expected to see all phenotypically wild type females and all crossveinless forked males (Fig. 3). However, we saw wild type males instead of crossveinless forked males and Glued Stubble males and females. Possibly some Marker III males were among the parents, which would account for the presence of Glued Stubble. Since every F1 progeny should have received a mutant gene from the unknown parental female for crossveinless and for forked, all males should show both traits. We do not believe the absence of crossveinless forked males is from scoring error, as we checked many flies repeatedly. An alternate explanation is that the unknown females were not virgin when introduced and produced phenotypically wild type progeny, or that the parental females were not from unknown stock.

As we determined from Crosses A and B, the eye color genes are autosomal. By the combined F2 data from Crosses A, B, and I (Table 9), if we hypothesize that the two eye color genes are independently assorting with each other, we get a X2 value of 98, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05. So, we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the two eye color genes are linked. The F1 progeny for all three crosses are all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the combined F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 44.2 map units apart.

In Table 9, mutant eye color and mutant body color appear together less frequently than mutant eye color and mutant wing venation (54 versus 126). In our skeletal report we interpreted this to mean that the wing venation gene and eye color genes were more independent than the body color gene and the eye color genes, and we assigned eye color genes to the chromosome body color is on, chromosome III. We used the body color and eye color data in Table 13 to calculate map distances of 65.9 map units between d (dark body color gene) and a, 67.3 map units between d and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. This produced the final results seen in Table 15 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report) and Fig. 4 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report). The map in Fig. 4 for chromosome III does not make sense (we have the distance between d and b calculated directly as 67.3 map units, and indirectly by using the distances between d and a and a and b as 110.1 map units) because the eye color genes should really be on chromosome II (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky). For this report we realized that we misinterpreted our data for the skeletal report. Since in the P generation, mutant eye color, body color, and wing venation all appear together, then linked genes will continue to appear together and unlinked genes will tend to appear separately. Since mutant eye color and mutant wing venation appear together more frequently than mutant eye color and mutant body color, eye color genes are linked to the wing venation gene on chromosome II. With this assignation in Table 14 we calculated map distances of 42.2 map units between sv (short longitudinal vein) and a, 86.4 map units between sv and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. Table 16 and Fig. 5 show the final determined genetic map for our unknown Drosophila. Although the calculated map distances for sv, b, and a with respect to each other on chromosome II differ from the given values of sv (II:3.8), a (II:57.0), and b (II:104.5) (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky), they are more logical than the distances found when body color and eye color genes are linked. The difference between our experimentally determined map distances and the actual numbers could be due to scoring error, crossing error, or an insufficiently sized pool.

Conclusion and Future Directions
Looking at Table 16, we can see that in U-4033 Drosophila the unknown genes orange (a), brown (b), dark body (d), and short veins (sv) are all autosomal recessive, with genes a, b, and sv on chromosome II and gene d on chromosome III. The linked genes a, b, and sv are mapped on chromosome II with respect to each other as shown in Fig 5. To help further clarify our data,

Materials and Methods
Oregon-R, unknown mutant, and marker stock Drosophila melanogaster were studied. Oregon-R have a wild type phenotype, unknown mutant have dark bodies, white eyes, and short longitudinal veins, and marker stocks have crossveinless wings with forked bristles, curly wings with small eyes and short bristles (although short bristle was undetectable), or small oblong eyes with short blunt stubbles. Flies were anethesized with CO2 or Fly Nap and manipulated with paintbrush or pick under the microscope. They were sexed, collected, crossed, and scored as described in the Biology 306 Introductory Genetics Laboratory Manual.

Crosses A, B, I, II, and III were set up initially. Cross A had unknown virgin females crossed to Ore-R males and as a reciprocal cross, Cross B had unknown males crossed to Ore-R virgin females. The F1 progeny were used to deduce whether the unknown mutations were autosomal or sex-linked and recessive or dominant. F1 progeny in both crosses then produced F2 progeny to examine the relationship between the mutant genes. Cross I had Marker I males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent F1 x F1 cross, Cross II had Marker II males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent male backcross, and Cross III had Marker III males crossed to unknown virgin females and a subsequent male backcross. All of these crosses were used to assign the mutant genes to chromosomes, and the Cross I F2 progeny were used along with the Cross A and B F2 progeny to map the two eye color genes.",0,0,17.81,16.17,16634
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Conjugation Lab Report,"Introduction
Bacteria are unicellular, haploid organisms that are suited for experiments because they reproduce rapidly by binary fission, produce genetically identical progeny, and are genetically simple. Normal bacteria can grow on minimal media, media containing only water, a carbon source, and inorganic salts, but some mutant auxotrophic bacteria have specific nutritional requirements. These requirements can be used to select for or against specific strains. Some bacteria can transfer a copy of accessory DNA to another by conjugation. During conjugation, cells containing a sex factor, F+, unidirectionally transfer a copy of this sex factor to cells lacking the sex factor, F-, through a conjugation canal. Because the conjugation canal is easily broken, the entire F factor rarely transfers, and so genes closer to the origin of the F factor (the first point to enter the F- cells) will appear with greater frequency among the resulting progeny. Once the F factor has been transferred the new genes will be expressed if they are dominant, and recombination can occur between the new genes and the DNA of the recipient cell. This phenomenon can be used to map bacterial genes. The frequency with which a particular gene appears in exconjugant progeny depends on its distance from the origin, and the number of recombinant progeny can be used to determine relative map distance between genes. In this experiment we conjugated F+ and F- cells with different genotypes and plated the resulting exconjugants onto different selective media plates. Our purpose was to determine the order of the genes involved with the selected traits relative to the point of origin, and to determine relative map distances between genes if possible.

Results
From the media 1 replica plates, we counted a total of 144 colonies, with the most on media 1, followed by media 5, media 2, media 3, and media 4 (with zero colonies). From the media 2 replica plates, we counted a total of 137 colonies, with the most on media 2, followed by media 5, media 3, media 1, and media 4 (with zero colonies). The tabulated results are in Tables 1 and 2.

Discussion
Plate 1 lacked threonine-leucine and selected for TL+, plate 2 lacked proline and selected for pro+, plate 3 lacked glucose and contained lactose and selected for lac+, plate 4 lacked glucose and contained galactose and selected for gal+, and plate lacked methionine and selected for met+. Plate 3 selected for lac+ and plate 4 selected for gal+ because each of those plates selected for bacteria that could utilize lactose and galactose as the sole carbon source, respectively. Among the media 1 replica plates, colonies 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 23, and 36 did not grow on the media 1 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for any of the other plates since we could not tell if these colonies on other plates did not grow because of the specific media they were on or because they were plated improperly (Table 3). Among the media 2 replica plates, colonies 1, 6, 34, and 35 did not grow on the media 2 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for the other plates (Table 4). With these adjustments, the total number of colonies on media 2 replicate plates was 134 and the total number of colonies on media 1 replicate plates was 130. More colonies grew overall on media 2 replica plates than media 1 replica plates, indicating that more colonies received the pro+ gene to survive on the pro- media than received the TL+ gene to survive on the TL- media, and that the pro gene must then come before the TL gene on the F factor. To determine the order of the other genes with respect to each of these markers, for each set we ranked the plates in order of most colonies grown due to received DNA. For plates 1, 2, 3, and 4, this was the number of colonies grown, but for plate 5 this was actually the number of colonies that did not grow since the original F- bacteria were met+ (Tables 3 and 4). So, F- bacteria grew on plate 5, but exconjugant bacteria that received the met- gene did not. For the media 1 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 1, followed by media 2, media 3, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: TL, pro, lac, met, and gal (Fig. 1). For the media 2 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 2, followed by media 3, media 1, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: pro, lac, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 2). The map based on media 2 plates is better because we know from above that the pro gene is closer to the origin than the TL gene. Since the two maps are inconsistent, we have to modify map 2 to take into account map 1. Based on the example in lecture notes, the modified map is lac, pro, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 3). On this map, the pro and lac genes are closer to the origin than the TL gene, so we can use the TL+ data to determine the distances between pro-TL and TL-lac (but not with gal or met since you can only determine map distances between markers and genes that enter the F- cell before them). Based on the TL+ data, pro and TL are 37.2 map units apart and lac and TL are 60.5 map units apart. From this we infer that lac and pro are 23.3 map units apart. However, looking at colonies selected for lac+ out of the pro+ colonies, the calculated map distance is 23.9 map units. Since calculating small distances is more accurate, we conclude that the map distance between lac and TL is 61.1 map units (Fig. 3). Once again, we cannot calculate any distances involving met or gal since they are farther from the origin than both of the markers we selected for. The slight discrepancy in the results could be due to scoring error, plating error, or other random error we have no control over (such as bacteria that does not grow as well as it should or bacteria that spontaneously mutate to grow when it should not). To compensate for the scoring error, we could dilute our bacteria by another factor of 10, but this would probably make the resulting data pool too small. A better alternative would be to repeat the experiment several times and then calculate the genetic distances using a large pool of data.

Conclusion
We studied conjugation in bacteria and the gradient of transmission method to map five genes on an F factor. We determined that with respect to the point of origin, the genes are in the order: lac, pro, TL, met, and gal, and that the relative map distance between lac and pro is 23.9 map units, between lac and TL is 61.1 map units, and between pro and TL is 37.2 map units.",0,0,4.73,3.25,6547
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,"Investigation 6: Plasmid Transfer, Genetic Stability and Nisin Resistance in Lactococci","Abstract
Lactococci are important because they have several applications to the biotech industry. They are used in the dairy industry as cheese starters because they are able to metabolize lactose and produce lactic acid. Bacteriocin genes such as nisin encoded on lactococcal plasmids prevent food from spoiling. The main aim of this investigation was to examine the phenotypic transfer of lactose utilization, proteinase production, and nisin resistance by conjugating two lactococcal strains. Results showed that there were more nisin resistant transconjugants than any other phenotype and this is to be expected since nisin is encoded on a self-transmissible plasmid. It was not uncommon for plasmids of different sizes to be observed in transconjugants due to recombination events facilitated by insertion sequences present on the plasmids. Not all phenotypes matched up with the particular plasmid makeup that would be expected, again because of recombination events between plasmids and also with the chromosomal DNA of the transconjugant.

Introduction
Lactococcal strains have several important industrial applications. In particular the species Lactococcus lactis has very simple and well characterized biochemical pathways and is added to milk to start the cheese making process. Starter cultures ferment sugars to produce lactic acid which serves to acidify milk and give cheese its flavor and texture (McAuliffe 2001). Lactococcal enzymes that utilize lactose as an energy source (confer Lac+ phenotype) are plasmid encoded as are several other essential enzymes. Bacteriophage resistance, protease and peptidase production, bacteriocin production and resistance are also encoded by genes that are present on native lactococcal plasmids (Cotter 2003). Serine proteases (confer Prt+ phenotype) degrade casein and thus provide the cells with the amino acids they need to grow. Food spoilage caused by pathogenic bacteria is prevented by the bacteriocin nisin that is encoded on several plasmids native to Lactococcus lactis (Takala 2002). The cells must also be resistant to nisin if they produce it (NisR phenotype). Nisin production and resistance, preptidase production, and lactose utilization all give lactococcus advantages in certain environments and are transferred through conjugation from donor to recipient cells by way of plasmids. Conjugation is dependent on transfer (tra) genes and certain self-transmisible plasmids can mobilize other non-transmissible plasmids. Insertion sequences (IS) are present on several lactococcal plasmids and cause recombination events to occur. During conjugation or mobilization, plasmids can recombine so as to produce new plasmids of different sizes and with different genetic makeups. The aim of this investigation was to analyze phenotypic transfer in transconjugants of Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis by selection of individual markers conferred from donor plasmids.

Materials and Methods
Donor and recipient strains

Donor strain: M189 (Lac+, Prt+, NisR) StrS; plasmids 60, 56, 40, 24, 3.7kb

Recipient strain: LM0203 (Lac-, Prt-, NisS) StrR; no plasmids
were combined and placed onto a nutrient agar plate to allow for conjugation to occur. The donor strain contained several different sized plasmids. The phenotypes associates with these various sized plasmids are as follows:

• NisR on the 60kb and 56kb plasmids; • Prt+ on the 56kb plasmid; • Lac+ on the 40kb plasmid
The 60kb plasmid encodes tra genes and also has insertion sequences so it is therefore self-transmisible and the IS's allow for recombination events to take place. After conjugation, cells were spread onto three different selective media plates in three replicates. The selection plates used were M17L + Sm, FSDA + Sm, and M17G + Sm + Nis; see Table 1 for an explanation of the phenotypes these selection plates are used to identify. Donor and recipient cells were also separately spread on these selective plates as controls. The number of colonies on each plate was recorded. Ten transconjugants from each of the three selective media plates were selected and streaked for single colonies on their respective medias. These single colonies were then pick and patched onto each of the three selective media plates in order to identify the growth response for the particular transconjugant. The phenotype of the transconjugants was recorded in terms of lactose utilization, nisin resistance, and proteinase production. Within the class each of the different possible phenotypic combinations were chosen and inoculated into M17G broth. The plasmids of these transconjugants were extracted and run on an agarose gel in order to visualize the plasmids present in the transconjugant. See the detailed procedure in the Micro3021 Microbial Genetics Course Kit (Cavicchioli 2005, p. 52-55).

Table 1: Selective media plates used in investigation six and the phenotypes they convey

Table here
Results
After the conjugation mix was plated onto the selective media plates the number of transconjugants was recorded, see Table 2. These transconjugant counts show the relative transfer frequency of various phenotypes. The most transconjugants, ~900 colonies, were found on the M17G + Sm + Nis plates followed next by the FSDA + Sm plates with ~500 colonies and the M17L + Sm plates had 15 transconjugants.

Table here
Table 2: Initial transconjugant counts on selective media after conjugation

Table 3: Transfer frequencies of various phenotypes

Table here
After single colonies were pick and patched onto the selective media plates many different phenotypic combinations were observed. The results in Table 3 show the class frequency of each phenotype as a percentage. There was a higher frequency of the NisR phenotype than any other phenotype.

The agarose gel phenotypic profile of our class showed that our results were not adequate to complete the report and so plasmid extraction data (Figure 1) and a table of the frequency of transconjugant plasmid profiles for given phenotypes collected throughout the years of this investigation (Figure 2) from Jeff Welch were used. In Figure 1, lanes two and three are the control donor and recipient strains. All of the plasmids (60, 56, 40, 24, and 3.7kb in size) can be visualized in the donor and there are no plasmids in the recipient. The lanes four through twenty-four show the size of plasmids that are present in cells that exhibit certain phenotypes.

Discussion
Part of the initial transconjugant counts, Table 2, and transfer frequency data, Table 3, was expected. First, the most growth, ~9000 transconjugants/ml, was observed in the M17G + Nisin + Sm plates and the least growth, ~150 transconjugants/ml, was observed on the M17L + Sm plates. We would expect more nisin resistant colonies (growth on M17G + Nisin + Sm plates) than Lac+ colonies (growth on M17L + Sm plates) because nisin resistance is encoded on the 60kb plasmid that is self-transmissible and does not depend on any other plasmid to mobilize its transfer and therefore transfers at a greater frequency. Another reason there are more nisin resistant transconjugants than Lac+ is also because several of the plasmids in the donor strain encoded nisin resistence, both the 56kb and the 60kb plasmids, while only the 40kb plasmid conferred the Lac+ phenotype. There is an over-representation of Prt+ transconjugants. The number of colonies per milliliter would be expected to be similar to the Lac+ since both phenotypes are encoded on a single plasmid that is not self-transmissible. Table 3 depicting the transfer frequencies of various phenotypes further shows that the NisR phenotype is more common than the Lac+ phenotype and this is because of the same reasons mentioned previously.

Jeff Welch also kept records of phenotype frequencies over several years as shown in Table 4. This collection of data has an over-representation of the NisS phenotype, in particular the Lac+ Prt- NisS phenotype is the most frequent of all of the phenotypes. These skewed results can be explained when one considers that this investigation is set up so that each of the possible phenotypes is chosen for plasmid extraction and so the rarer phenotypes appear to be more common than they actually are.

Some of the various phenotypes in Figure 1 relate to the genotype or plasmid composition that would be expected. For example, lane thirteen has the phenotype Lac- Prt+ NisR and has two plasmids of sizes 56kb and 60kb. Proteinase is encoded on the 56kb plasmid and nisin resistance is encoded on both the 60kb and 56kb plasmids. The transconjugant did not have the 40kb plasmid that confers lactose utilization and the Lac- phenotype is fittingly observed. Another transconjugant where the phenotype and plasmid makeup match up is number twenty-three. The phenotype is Lac+ Prt- NisR and the 56kb plasmid encoding proteinase is missing.

The plasmid extraction gel in Figure 1 reveals the presence of plasmids that are of different sizes than the ones found in the donor strain. Different sized plasmids with varying genetic composition can be obtained through recombination events among the plasmids. The transconjugant in lane number nine is Lac+ Prt+ NisS but only has one plasmid that is greater than 60kb. It is likely that the 40kb (Lac+) plasmid and the part of the 56kb plasmid that confers the Prt+ phenotype recombined to form this novel sized plasmid that gives this particular phenotype. It is also possible that the Lac and/or Prt genes recombined with the chromosome of the transconjugant and confer the Lac+ Prt+ NisS phenotype in that way. Recombination events happen when insertion sequences are present flanking certain genes. These sequences are marked for excision from the plasmid and insertion into either another plasmid or chromosomal DNA. An example of a transconjugant where it is likely that a chromosomal recombination event occurred are lane numbers four and five of Figure 1. These transconjugants have 56kb and 60kb plasmids most likely giving them their Prt+ and NisR phenotypes, but there is no 40kb plasmid present that would confer the Lac+ phenotype that is observed. This data suggests that the Lac gene recombined into the chromosomal DNA.

In summary, the nisin resistant transconjugants were more frequent observed because NisR is carried on a self-transmissible plasmid and is also present on more than one plasmid while the other phenotypes, Prt+ and Lac+, were only carried on one plasmid each. Some phenotypes matched up with their expected genotypes, but there were many that did not. Transconjugants with plasmids of sizes different than those present in the donor strain were observed because recombination events occurred.",0,0,0,0,10710
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Genetic analysis of a mutant strain of Drosophila melanogaster,"Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster was the organism used in this genetic investigation. The genetic mutations in unknown strain number 4254 were characterized and their genetic loci were mapped. Wild type flies have red eyes, gray bodies, and a normal wing venation pattern. The unknown strain had white eyes, a black body, and a mutant wing venation characterized by a gap in the second horizontal wing vein. Reciprocal crosses and marker crosses were conducted in order to determine the modes of inheritance for each gene and resolve map distances. The gene for body color, b, and wing venation, v, were both found to be recessive single gene traits that are linked on chromosome 3, refer to Figure 1 for the location of these genes relative to marker III mutations small Glued (Gl) eyes and short Stubbled (Sb) bristles. Eye color was found to be a two gene, w and n, trait characterized by a recessive epistatic relationship between the two genes. ww is is epistatic over n+_ or nn. A fly with a genotype of w+_n+_ has a wild type red eye phenotype, a w+_nn fly has orange eyes, and a wwn+_ fly and also wwnn fly has white eyes. The eye color genes were linked to the X chromosome and their loci were mapped along with marker I mutations for wings lacking crossveins (cv) and bent/forked bristles (f), according to Figure 1.

Introduction
This experiment used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, more commonly known as the fruit fly, which is one of the most valuable organisms in genetic and developmental research today. Drosophila has been used for many years in research and its entire genome has been sequenced. The life cycle for the fruit fly is short, ten to fourteen days, with a developmental time of nine days and because of this, experimental results can be generated relatively quickly. Drosophila flies are inexpensive to maintain in the laboratory setting and are easy to manipulate. All of these characteristics contribute to the wide use of this organism in genetic research today.

This experiment aimed to characterize an unknown mutant strain of flies through genetic analysis by answering several questions that this experiment was designed to answer. First, how many of the phenotypic differences in the unknown strain are inherited? And of the inherited traits, how many genes are involved in defining the trait? Moreover, how are the genes inherited, are they dominant, recessive, autosomal, sex-linked or do they have some other inheritance pattern? Finally, where are the genes for the identified traits located on the chromosomes? In order to answer these questions, scoring information from reciprocal crosses between the unknown flies and known wild type flies were coupled with scoring data from crosses with three marker strains that have mutations in genes of known chromosomal locations. Three marker strains were used corresponding to the three main pairs of chromosomes in D. melanogaster (Drosophila has a forth pair of chromosomes but they are very small and do not code for many genes). In order to completely characterize and map any unknown mutations F2 progeny were generated from the reciprocal crosses and the sex chromosome marker cross and male backcross progeny were generated from the two other marker cross progeny.

Another supplemental objective of this experiment was for the experimenters to learn how to work with Drosophila melanogaster. Skills in the handling and maintenance of this frequently used organism are valuable tools to add to a future molecular biologists repertoire.

Materials and Methods
Eight bottles of unknown mutant flies were obtained and their phenotypes were recorded. Two bottles of wild type flies were also obtained and all unknown and known bottles were cleared of adults. The wild type strain used was Oregon-R (Ore-R) characterized by a gray body, red eyes, and normal wing venation. Virgin females (virgin ♀) and males (♂) were collected from the unknown, wild type, and marker strains. The marker number represents the chromosome number that the known mutations in that strain are on. Refer to the MCDB 306 Genetics Laboratory Manual for further details about these strains.

Reciprocal crosses A and B, and marker crosses I, II, and III were set up in duplicate according to Table 2 Phase I Crosses. Approximately ten females and twenty males were added to each of the crosses described. One hundred flies were scored from each of the F1 crosses before the bottles were cleared and more virgin females and males were collected in order to set up the second round of crosses. In Phase II cross A, B, and marker cross I were used to create F2 progeny by crossing the F1 progeny. Phase II marker crosses II and III were male backcrosses between unknown females and mutant marker males. See Phase II Crosses in Table 2. The scoring results from phase I and II crosses were analyzed and the genetic inheritance pattern, linkage data, and map distances were determined.

Table 2: Phase I and phase II crosses

Table here
Results and Discussion
A and B Cross
The F1 progeny of cross A and B were tabulated, see Table 3. In both A and B crosses, all of the F1 progeny (♂ and ♀) had wild type body color and wild type wing venation which suggests that these mutant phenotypes are recessive. Furthermore, males and females were distributed approximately equally for the body color and wing venation trait in both crosses which suggests that the genes for body color and wing venation traits are autosomal.

Table 3 shows that all cross A females have wild type eye color and all males have mutant eye color. This pattern of inheritance is indicative of a sex-linked gene since males receive only the mutant allele they have the mutant phenotype but females have one wild type allele and one mutant allele so they have a wild type phenotype given that mutant eye color is a recessive trait. Cross A F1 females all inherit one copy of the wild type eye color gene which is enough to confer the wild type phenotype so eye color is a recessive trait. Phase II of the A and B crosses involved a cross between the F1 progeny, see Table 4 for body color and wing venation results.

Table 3: F1 progeny of A and B Crosses

Table 4: Phase II cross - F2 progeny of A and B crosses

Table here
Table here
If body color and wing venation are two allele, recessive, single gene traits with complete dominance then they would be expected to segregate 3:1 wild type:mutant. The body color trait segregated 3.56:1 wild type gray body:mutant black body. A χ2 test was conducted which did not reject the hypothesis that body color is a recessive single gene trait. The wing venation trait segregated at a ratio of 4.4:1 wild type:mutant wing venation and a χ2 test rejected the hypothesis that wing venation is a recessive single gene trait (Skeletal Report 5). This data conclusion is not consistent with the F1 progeny data that showed that wing venation was a recessive trait. However, since only a small number of F2 flies were scored there is a chance of random error which may explain the unexpected result of the χ2 test. Scoring errors or expressivity/penetrance problems of the wing venation mutation could also have been factors in this unexpected result.

Since the genes for body color and wing venation have been characterized as autosomal, another χ2 test was conducted to see whether the two genes were independently assorting. If two genes independently assort then the expected dihybrid ratio of F2 progeny is 9:3:3:1, wild type:single mutant:other single mutant:double mutant. A modified dihybrid ratio had to be created based on the observed F2 ratios in order to more accurately judge independent assortment based on the data generated from this experiment. See Table 5 for the modified expected ratios and expected number of flies for the dihybrid cross compared to the actual observed numbers for each of the four phenotypes. If the genes were segregating independently then a ratio of 15.7 : 4.4 : 3.56 : 1 would be expected; however, there are approximately three times more double mutants than would be expected if the genes were segregating independently which logically suggests that the genes are linked. And indeed, a χ2 test rejected the hypothesis that the genes for body color and wing venation are independently assorting so the alternative is that they are linked. The map distance between body color and wing venation was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. (Skeletal Report 6)

Table 5: Determining independent assortment or linkage between body color and wing venation (modified dihybrid ratio)

Table here
As Table 6 shows, a new orange eye color was observed in the F2 generation and there are only wild type females in cross B F2 progeny. Based on this data, the best hypothesis for the interaction that creates eye color is a two gene epistatic interaction where homozygous white eye mutations are epistatic over homozygous or heterozygous orange mutations. The proposed interaction is:

Formula here
Table here
The expected results based on this hypothesis are that the two genes for eye color are linked on the X chromosome because the F1 data showed that eye color is sex-linked and the only explanation for having only wild type F2 females for cross B is if this is the case. See Page A of the attached Skeletal Report for the details of the crosses and how alleles segregate to give this pattern of inheritance. The map distance between the two eye color genes, w and n, was calculated from cross A F2 data to be 28.57 mu.

Male Parent Backcross: Crosses II and III
Marker crosses II and III were conducted in order to map autosomal genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for body color and wing venation. Each of the mutations in the M2 and M3 strains was dominant and homozygous lethal. The marker stocks were part of a balanced lethal system which consisted of a true breeding heterozygote combination of known marker mutations. Crossovers are suppressed in this type of genetic setup and the original Bl L / Cy and Gl Sb / LVM genotypes for marker II and marker III, respectively, were conserved. The initial M2 and M3 marker crosses produced F1 progeny that were expected from the conclusions based on A and B reciprocal cross progeny. All progeny were either Bristle Lobed or Curly in M2 or Glued Stubbled or wild type in M3 because those mutations were dominant in the marker stocks. All F1 progeny had wild type body color and wing venation because these two genes were determined to be autosomal and recessive.

In phase II crosses, F1 males were backcrossed to unknown mutant females and if the recessive mutation showed up with the male backcross progeny (Br L or Cy for marker II and Gl Sb for marker III) and four phenotypes were present in the F1 male backcross progeny, then the gene for the mutation is not linked to that marker's chromosome. If a recessive mutation is linked to the markers chromosome, then the mutant phenotype would not show up with male backcross progeny and only two phenotypes would be present in F1 male backcross progeny. The results of phase II male backcrosses are summarized in Table 7.

Table 7: Cross II and III F1 male backcross progeny

Cross II (M2)

Table here
Cross III (M3)

Table here
Green colored numbers were scored from F1 curly (M2) or wild type (M3) ♂s x unknown ♀s

Black colored numbers were scored from F1 Bristle Lobed (M2) or Glued Stubbled (M3) ♂s x unknown ♀s

Table 7 data from cross II shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation segregated with the male backcross curly progeny. This means that the body color and wing venation genes are not on the second chromosome. The mutations did not segregate with the Bristle Lobed marker mutations in this experiment, but it would be expected that a larger population of flies would show mutant body color and mutant wing venation showing up together in the F1 male backcross progeny. Cross III shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation do not segregate with F1 male backcross progeny suggesting that these genes are located on the third chromosome. Two flies were scored to be Glued Stubbled, dark body, white eye, wild type wing venation, marked by an asterisk in Cross III. This unexpected result is likely due to a scoring error.

The mutant wing venation gene was given to be at locus 47 m.u. and was said to have a smaller map distance than the gene for body color. The map distance between the genes for wing venation and body color was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. This information is enough to assign a location on chromosome three to each of these three genes, see Figure 2.

Figure 2: Gene loci on chromosome 3

Figure here
Cross I
Marker cross I was conducted in order to map sex-linked genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for eye color. The mutant marker genes present on the X chromosome are recessive and produce a crossveinless (cv) forked (f) phenotype. The initial M1, M2, and M3 marker crosses produced the expected mutant white eye color male and wild type red eyed female F1 progeny. All M1 F1 progeny were wild type for marker 1 mutations (cv f) since all males received a normal copy of these genes from the unknown female parent.

Based on the analysis of F2 data of crosses A and B the two eye color genes were determined to be linked on the X chromosome. The possible genotypes and phenotypes for Cross I F2 progeny are depicted in Tables 8 and 9 as well as the number of male flies scored in each of the phenotypic categories. Only males were included in this table and in determining map distances because it is only males that carry information about crossover events that are needed to map genes. The female progeny had approximately equal numbers (~64 flies) of red eye and white eye progeny and half that number (34 flies) of orange progeny. Table 8 and 9 are set up as three point crosses with only one of the marker I mutations included in relationship to each eye color gene. Table 10 is a two point cross for the marker mutations (cv and f) that shows the phenotype and number of male progeny in each category.

Table here
Table here
Table here
Table here
These two and three point crosses were used to calculate the map distances between cv, f, w, and n on the X chromosome, see Table 11. For calculation details refer to page 11 of the Skeletal Report attached. After finding that the map distance between cv and f was slightly off from the actual known distance, the map distances between all other genes were corrected using the correction factor (43/41.7). The numerator in this factor is the actual distance between cv and f and 41.7 was the experimental map distance. Table 11 shows corrected map distances.

The map distances in Table 11 along with the relative number of flies in each category give enough information to determine gene order. The cv-w and cv-n distances add together to give the distance between w and n which tells that cv is between w and n on the chromosome. In the f-w-n three point cross the least number of flies were found in the orange forked phenotype which was assumed to be the double cross over event. In a double cross over the only gene that will be different from the parental genotype will be the gene in the middle of the two crossovers. The genotype of the F1 female parent was f w+ n+ and the genotype of the double cross over was f w+ n. The gene that is different from the parent is n which means that n is in between f and w.

The locus of each gene was finally determined using the gene order and map distance data explained above coupled with the given locus of gene w at 1.5 m.u.. See Figure 3 for a diagram of the X chromosome and the locus of the eye color and marker I genes.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Analysis of a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster,"Abstract:
Drosophila Melanogaster, known as the common fruit fly, is often used in genetic research. An unknown fruit fly, U-5309, was found to have several characteristics that deviate from the Oregon-R wild type strain. These characteristics are white eyes, shortened longitudinal veins, and dark body. It was determined that the mode of inheritance for the white eye color mutation is sex-linked, recessive, and controlled through epistatic gene interaction between two genes white (a) and orange (b); the gene for white is epistatic over the gene for orange. The mode of inheritance for both the dark body color (d) and shortened longitudinal veins (sv) is autosomal recessive and each controlled by a single gene. Both mutant alleles were discovered to be located on chromosome 3. The determined location of each of the examined genes aside the known marker mutations used in this experiment is found below. (Figure 1)

Introduction:
The fly Drosophila Melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms used in biological research in genetics and is considered a model system for several reasons: they contain only 3 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; the entire genome has been sequenced; they are small and easy to grow in the laboratory; they have a short generation and high productivity; and the males do not show recombination.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the number of genes involved in each mutant phenotype (white eye color, dark body color, short veined wings veins), the mode of inheritance for these mutations, and the genetic loci of each of these genes. The experiment was carried out in three main steps. Unknown flies with wild type flies underwent two reciprocal crosses to determine the mode of inheritance for each mutation; the analysis of the F1 and F2 generations revealed whether the mutant phenotypes were dominant or recessive and autosomal or sex linked. In the next step, U-5309 virgin females were separately crossed with males from M2 and M3 marker stocks that contained known mutations on autosomal chromosomes 2 and 3 respectively. The F1 males of these crosses were back crossed to U-5309 virgin female flies in order to ascertain the genetic loci of the autosomal mutations. Finally, a cross between U-5309 female flies with male flies of known marker mutations on the X chromosome (M1) was carried out to the F2 generation in hopes of establishing the genetic loci of possible sex linked mutations.

Materials and Methods:
The flies were prepared for observation and handling by anesthetization using CO2. The flies were then transferred to CO2 pad and examined and counted under a microscope. (See pg. 1-6 of lab manual for more details).

Several different strains of flies were used for this experiment: unknown mutant strain U-5309, wild type Oregon R strain, and three marker mutation strains with known mutations. The genotypes and phenotypes for each strain are listed in Table 1.

Table 1. Genotypes and phenotypes of fly strains

Table here
In this experiment, 5 different crosses were used. In Cross A, Oregon-R males and U-5309 virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 generation. The males and females of the F1 generation were then crossed with each other to produce an F2 generation. Likewise, U-5309 males and Oregon R virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 and F2 generation in Cross B. In a separate cross, Cross I, U-5309 virgin females were crossed with M1 males also to produce an F1 and F2 generation. In Cross II and Cross III respectively, U-5309 virgin females and M2 and M3 males were carried out to the F1 generation, and then the F1 males were backcrossed with U-5309 virgin females. (See pp 19-25 of lab manual for more details)

Results and Discussion:
Table here
The F1 data of crosses A and B show the wild type phenotype for body color in both males and females (Tables 2 and 3). This signifies that the wild type phenotype is dominant over the mutant dark body phenotype. The F2 results of crosses A and B show two phenotypes, light and dark body, in both males and females. The presence of both wild type and mutant body color in the F1 and F2 generations indicate that the gene for body color is autosomal. In the F2 generation, there is a sizable majority of light body color over dark body color, which further supports that dark body color is a recessive mutation and independently assorts (Table 4). Chi square analysis was used to determine whether body color is a single gene trait that independently assorts properly to produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in progeny. The p value was calculated to be 1.86 x 10-3, which indicates that our data body color is not segregating properly. This either implies that there may be another factor that influences the segregation of body color alleles so that they do not independently assort, or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results.

Table 2. F1 of cross A (U-5309 virgin ♀x Oregon R ♂)

Table here
Table 3. F1 of cross B (U-5309 ♂ x Oregon R virgin ♀)

Table here
The F1 data of Crosses A and B also show wild type phenotype for wing venation in both males and females. This suggests that the mutant wing venation is recessive and autosomal. Furthermore, the F2 generation shows males and females both containing both wild type and mutant longitudinal wing venation, and also resulted in significantly more wild type longitudinal wing venation (503) than the mutant phenotype (115). This suggests that the gene for wing venation undergoes independent assortment. However, chi square analysis to test if wing venation is a single gene trait that undergoes independent assortment produced a p value of 2.43x10-4, which indicates that wing venation is not undergoing independent segregation properly. This result, similar to body color, indicates that there also may be another factor influencing body color segregation or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results.

Chi square analysis was also used to see if longitudinal wing venation and body color genes assorted independently from each other. Using the observed ratios obtained from body color data and wing venation data separately, chi square analysis produce a p value of 0, which led to the conclusion that body color and longitudinal wing venation did not assort independently from each other. Recombination analysis produced a genetic map distance of 42.1 map units between the two genes. (See Appendix for all chi square calculations)

The Cross A F1 results for eye color produced all females with red eyes and all males with white eye color. (Table 2) The females of the F1 generation must all be heterozygous, which shows that the mutant eye color is a recessive mutation. However, since the F1 generation only contained males with white eyes, the gene for eye color was determined to be sex linked; all the males in the F1 generation receive one X chromosome from the mutant female parent, and a Y chromosome from the wild type male parent which does not contain any corresponding wild type alleles. The Cross B F1 results for eye color show both male and female flies with

red eyes (Table 3) This is because the males inherit their single x chromosome from their wild type female parent.

Table 4. F2 body color and wing venation data of crosses A and B

Table here
Table 5. F2 eye color data from crosses A and B

Table here
Figure 2: Proposed Pathway for eye color inheritance

Figure here
The F2 generation of Cross B produced several different eye color phenotype: red, white, and orange (Table 5). This suggests that there are two genes involved in determining eye color. The appearance of specifically three different eye colors suggests that eye color is controlled by two genes showing epistatic interaction (Figure 2). The high number of mutant phenotype observed indicates that the gene coding for white eyes (a) is epistatic over the gene coding for orange eyes (b). Also in the B Cross F2 generation, only the red eye phenotype was found in females. If the two genes had undergone independently assortment, the females in F2 would contain more than one phenotype. However, females only showed wild type phenotype for eyes, indicating that these two genes are linked. Moreover, the unequal appearance of different eye colors between the male and female flies of the F2 generation in cross B further supports the previous conclusion that the genes for eye color located on the x chromosome. Using recombination analysis, the genetic map distance between the two genes controlling eye color was determined to be 30.0 map units for cross A and cross B combined.

In order to determine the genetic loci of the two linked autosomal recessive mutations of U-5309, body color and wing venation, males from the M2 and M3 balanced marker stocks were crossed with U-5309 virgin females in Crosses 2 and 3 respectively. The crosses produced an F1 generation that showed wild type phenotypes for both wing venation and body color, as expected. Balanced marker stocks are true breeding heterozygous strains that maintain the same genotype through a homozygous lethal system. 50 flies of each cross were scored to confirm that the marker mutations, body color, and wing venation were all assorting properly.

Continuing Cross 2, male F1 flies with lobed eyes were back crossed with virgin U-5309 females. There were not enough progeny from this cross for allow for statistical significance. However, from the few flies that were scored, the back cross progeny showed three distinct phenotypes: light body, normal wing venation, and bristle lobed; light body normal wing venation, and curly wing; dark body, mutant wing, and curly wing. Since dark body color and mutant longitudinal wing appeared with the marker mutations, it indicates that the body color gene and wing venation gene are not located on the same chromosome as the marker mutations, the 2nd chromosome (Figure 1B). The white eye phenotype also appeared with the marker 2 mutations in male backcross progeny, confirming that the genes for eye color are not located on the 2nd chromosome, as expected. The less stable homozygous lethal system of the marker genes along with the exposure of CO2 to the F1 males may account for the extremely low backcross progeny count.

Cross 3 was continued by back crossing male F1 flies with virgin U-5309 females to see if the body color gene and wing venation gene are located on the 3rd chromosome. There were only two different phenotypes observed in the progeny: light body, normal wing venation, glued eyes, and stubble bristles; dark body, mutant wing venation. Only wild type phenotypes for body color and wing venation appeared with the marker mutations glued eye and stubble bristles in the male backcross progeny, indicating that both wing venation and body color genes are both on the 3rd chromosome. It was known that the wing venation mutation is located at 0 on the chromosome

3. Therefore, according to the distance between the two genes previously determined through recombination analysis, the location of the body color gene is at 42.1 map units on the third chromosome, between the genes for glued eye and stubble bristles (Figure 1C).

To discover the genetic loci on the x chromosome of the two genes controlling eye color, virgin U-5301 females were crossed with marker 1 males (Cross I). The F1 generation contained red eyed females and white eyed males, as expected. Among the 50 female progeny of the F2 generation, the phenotype found in the least number was orange eyes. This further supports our conclusion of an epistatic relationship between the two genes. A total of 104 male progeny were scored and 6 phenotypes were observed with the possibility of 8 different genotypes between the three genes: cv, a, b. (Table 6). The phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. Since the location of gene a already was already known to be at position 1.5, the distance between gene a and gene cv was used to determine the correction factor. The corrected distances showed that the distance between cv-b was the largest, thus placing gene a between cv and b (Table 7). However, this would place gene b in a location entirely off of the chromosome. Therefore it was predicted that the data collected was not representative of the actual genetic loci of gene b.

Table 6. 3-point cross between cv-a-b

Table here
Table 7. cv-a-b 3-point distance calculations

Table here
Table 8. 3-point cross between f-a-b

Table here
Another 3 point cross was calculated to determine the location of the two eye color genes in relation to the known forked bristle gene of the marker mutation. (Table 8). Similar to the cv-a-b cross, the phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. The distance between f-b was calculated to be the largest, therefore supporting the placement of gene a between genes b and f. Since the locations of gene a and gene f were both given, the distance between them was used in the correction factor. (Table 9).

Table 9. f-a-b 3-point distance calculations

Table here
One possible explanation for the inconsistent results in the 3 point crosses could be attributed to the difficulty in distinguishing between orange and red eyes of the back cross progeny in Cross I. Also, if more Cross 1 F2 progeny had been scored, perhaps more accurate results could be obtained.

A 2-point cross was also determined between cv-f. (Table 10) Based on knowing the actual gene loci of genes cv and f, it was expected that would be more crossveinless and forked bristled progeny than actually observed. The calculated map distance between the two genes based on our observed results was 3.8, which is significantly smaller than the known 43 m.u. It is not reasonable to use the correction factor of 43/3.8 to correct the values derived from the 3-point crosses because the values calculated would be much larger than the actual chromosome. Scoring more than progeny may have resulted in relatively more recombinant progeny, therefore producing a more accurate distance between the two genes.

Table 10. cv-f 2-point cross

Table here
Based on previously knowing the locations of genes a, cv, and f, and only looking at the relative positions of the genes to each other, the gene order should be b-a-cv-f. However, the map distances between the four genes given in the point crosses are significantly inconsistent with each other. All three point crosses placed gene b in a location off of the actual x chromosome. Because of these unfeasible results, the genetic distance determined through recombination analysis of Crosses A and B was ultimately used to determine the location of gene b. Since the location of gene a at 1.5 is known, gene b must be located at position 31.5. This would place gene b between gene cv and gene f at positions 13.7 and 56.7 respectively (see Figure 1).

Summary:
In our experiment, it was determined through crosses A and B that the genes for wing venation and body color are autosomal, recessive, and linked. From the F2 generation of both crosses, the genetic distance between the two genes was calculated to be 42.1. Crosses II and III located gene d and gene sv on chromosome 3. Although Cross II did not produce enough back cross progeny for significance, the data obtained still suggested that genes sv and d were both located on the 3rd chromosome. Therefore, given that the location of gene sv is at 0 on chromosome 3, it was determined that the location of gene d is at position 42.1 of the same chromosome.

Through Cross A and Cross B, it was revealed that our mutant eye color is controlled by two genes that exhibit epistatic interaction. The gene for white eyes is epistatic over the gene for orange eyes. Based on the phenotypes of the F1 and F2 generations, it was found that the genes for eye color are also recessive and sex linked. The two 3-point crosses and one 2-point cross analysis of Cross I resulted in a location for the orange eye gene that was unfeasible. Since the genetic location of gene a on the x chromosome was previously known, the location of gene b was determined to be at position 30.0 based on the recombinant frequencies calculated from crosses A and B. This would place gene b between the marker genes cv and f at 13.7 and 56.7 m.u. respectively.",0,0,26.3,9.12,16614
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Conjugation Lab Report: Bacterial Conjugation and Genetic Mapping in E. Coli,"Abstract
In this experiment we studied the phenomenon of conjugation between two members of the E.Coli species, Hfr and F-. We used selective media to grow conjugated recombinants to determine genetic loci of these genes in relation to an origin of transfer. We used the method of uninterrupted mating. We then plated the original suspension on these specific media plates. The final viable colonies were counted and organized by recombined phenotype, allowing us to calculate genetic map distances of the genes in the bacterial chromosome and determine the order of entry of the genes into the F- bacteria from the Hfr strain. We determined that the order of entry was lac+ first, pro+ next, followed by TL+, gal+, and if met- had made it all the way through the conjugation tube it would be last. Below is a chromosomal map of our map distance findings for the genes transferred by the Hfr.

Origin of Transfer

Introduction
We used bacterial conjugation to measure genetic distances and observe recombined phenotypes through the use of E. Coli, specifically, an Hfr strain that is F+. This categorization indicates that the bacteria contain a non-attached, transferable sex factor that can be donated to an F- strain, which we introduced through uninterrupted mating. This creates a donor pair, the male is known as a genetic donor, F+ and the female as a genetic recipient, F-. Bacterial conjugation is the formation of a very fragile conjugation tube that creates a canal for the F factor to be transferred. The canal is created through contact of pili from one bacterium to the cell wall of another, known as collision. Next, the bacteria must identify each other as a donor-acceptor pair. Once the conjugation tube has been formed, the transfer occurs. This is an energy dependent, sequential transfer that is unidirectional and proceeds at a slow but constant rate. The selecting gene must then be expressed phenotypically, if they are dominant. Finally there must be integration of the gene into the replicated genome of the accepting bacteria. This specific order of operation sets limitations to conjugation. The gene that is closest to the origin of transfer has the greatest chance of getting into the F-cell's chromosome. The origin of transfer is the point at which a break occurs in the integrated F factor. This is the leading point of the chromosome to be transferred. By selecting for a certain gene that we expect to be transferred and analyzing the amount of bacteria that grew in the specified media, we can determine genetic distances between these genes and are able to tell where recombination about these genes took place.

To begin the process of conjugation, we mixed 0.2 ml of Hfr culture with 1.8ml of F- culture. We then incubated the mixture at 37oC for 60-70 minutes, this is known as uninterrupted mating. We then took the mixture out of incubation and added 1ml of it to 9ml of nutrient broth for dilution. This created a concentration of 10-1. With a pipette, we transferred 0.1ml from the original solution to three plates, media 1, 2 and 4. We then transferred 0.1ml from the diluted solution to three new plates, media1, 2, and 4. These six plates were then incubated at 37oC for 48 hours. The following day, the plates were scored and 2 master plates were created from the viable colonies, one on media 1 the other on media 2. We chose to create our master plates from the original solution, and allow our dilution plates to be used by other students. These plates were then incubated at 37oC for 24 hours. Once the incubation period had passed, we replicated the master plates onto the above mentioned media plates. The media 1 master plate was replicated to media 2,then 3,then 4,then 5, and finally to media 1. The media 2 master plate was replicated to media 1, then 3, then 4, then 5, and finally to media 2. Once results were observed, the following day, the plates were placed into cold storage until they could be viewed by the GSI.

Results
In this experiment we found that through uninterrupted mating of the Hfr and F-, we get the highest number of viable colonies from the media 2 plate, which selects for Pro+. We then see that the media 1 plate, which selects for TL+, exhibits the next highest number of colonies and finally that the least number of colonies grows on media 4, which selects for Gal+, as supported by the Table III of the appendix. We see from the media 1 master selection plate series that the most number of colonies grew on media 1, selecting as previously mentioned, and media 5, which selects for Met+, followed by media 2, also selects as previously mentioned, then media 3, which selects for Lac+. The least amount of colonies grew on media 4, the Gal+ selecting plate. The numerical data for the media 1 master plate selections can be found in Table IV of the appendix. The data from the media 2 master selection plate series shows the highest amount of growth on the media 2, as well as media 5. Media 3 plate had the next highest amount of colonies followed by media 1, to leave only media 4 as the plate having the fewest colonies. This information can be found with numerical values for colonies in Table V of the appendix.

Discussion
Through the methods of selection we conclude that the first gene to enter the F- cell is Lac+ gene, which indicates its location as being the closest to origin of transfer. Following the Lac+ gene, in order, we see that Pro+, TL+, and Gal+ enter successively. We determine that the Met- gene from the Hfr was not expressed phenotypically in our recombinants. This is because any bacteria containing this gene, assuming it is dominant, would not have survived our selective media 5. The order of entry of these genes was determined through three criteria found through the analyses of the plates. The first criteria came from our initial uninterrupted data that told us through order of decreasing quantity that Pro+ must be closer to the origin of transfer Than TL+ and Gal+ because the media 2 plate had the most colonies. TL+ comes next followed by Gal+. The second criteria comes from our analyses of the TL+ selection plates which tells us that in this selection, Pro+ must be closer to TL+ than Lac+. The third criteria comes from the Pro+ selection plate series that tells us when selecting for Pro+, Lac+ must be closer to Pro+ than TL+. Through creation of organized tables (please see appendix) of the recombinant phenotypes, we are able to calculate map distances between the genes selected for and those that come between it and the origin of transfer. Table VI in the appendix has the data and calculations for the map distances carefully outlined. Below is a map of our found genetic order of entry as well as the calculated map distances of the selected genes. The discrepancy in the two calculated distances between the TL+ and Lac+ in Table VI is 10 mu. This could be due to the fact that we had more recombinants between crosses 1 and 4 of the media 1 selection than expected and less recombination between crosses 1 and 3 of the media 1 selection. In order to find a perfect correlation between the calculations, we would have needed more colonies that had recombined to give us a TL+ Pro+ Lac- phenotype. We could repeat the experiment to determine whether this was the case or whether there was a discrepancy in the media 2 master selection series. We chose to use the values for the map distances that were shorter because it is known that when we determine map units that the direct distance between genes is more accurate that when calculating a distance that passes over genes.

Origin of Transfer

Conclusion
We can conclude from this experiment that the order of entry is Lac+ first, Pro+ second, TL+ third, Gal+ fourth and Met+ fifth. We can also conclude that the genetic map distance between Lac+ and Pro+ is 24 mu, the distance between TL+ and Pro+ is 36 mu, and consequently the distance between TL+ and Lac+ is 60 mu. We cannot conclude any distances from the origin for Gal+ or Met+ since they entered the F- bacteria after the genes that we selected for.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Drosophila Melanogaster Genetic Analysis Experiment,"Abstract
In this experiment the Ore-R phenotype (wild type) of Drosophila was crossed with unknown U-2544 phenotype. The Ore-R exhibits a light tan body color with red eyes. It also has all five longitudinal wing venations as well as the two cross veins. The first cross vein is located between the L3 and L4 longitudinal veins and the second between L4 and L5 longitudinal veins. The unknown U-2544 exhibits a mutant dark tan body with mutant white eyes and has mutant longitudinal wing venations that do not fully extend the length of the wing but rather only about 2/3 of the wing length. The U-2544 however does exhibit the two cross veins as the Ore-R phenotype exhibits. We also used three stocks of marker Drosophila known as Markers II, III, and I named for the chromosomal locus of their mutations. We concluded that there are two genes involved in eye color mutations, which are located on chromosome II. Here we have called these genes the ""o"" and the ""b"" genes for orange and brown-eyed mutants respectively. For the body color mutation we found only one gene to bear responsibility and so was named ""d"" for dark body. This gene was found to be located on chromosome III. Also to be found on this third chromosome was our mutant gene for shortened longitudinal wing venation. This gene was named ""w"". The single allele mutations, w and d, were found to both be of autosomal recessive inheritance. The mutations in eye color controlled by two genes were also found to be autosomal and recessive to wild type but epistatic to each other. Below are chromosomal maps of U-2544's first three chromosomes including the genetic locus of the known marker mutations as well as the found locus of the unknown mutations (shown in bold).

Introduction
Drosophila melanogaster is a well-studied species that is easily anesthetized and handled. Because of this, as well as its relatively small genome of four chromosomes and short developmental duration of four days to imago, Drosophila is an ideal species for genetic analysis. The fact that virgin female flies, which are necessary in order to ensure proper genetic crossing, are easily extracted from a newly hatched population due to the innate inability of either sex to mate within the first ten or so hours of life, furthers this attraction to Drosophila as a controlled laboratory experiment. In this experiment we take advantage of these characteristics and use them to identify the genetic locus of specific mutations that cause deviations in the wild type phenotypic eye color, body color and wing venation. This can be achieved by performing five crosses. The parental reciprocal crosses, A and B, are performed to determine whether the mutant genes are sex-linked, autosomal, recessive, or dominate. The parental cross of the unknown virgin females with the males of marker stocks' II, III and I provide verification to the findings of the reciprocal crosses as well as confirmation of known information of the dominate marker II and marker III mutations, and the recessive mutations of the marker I stock. The F2 generations of these marker crosses become useful when determining gene interactions and chromosomal locus. By observing the expressed phenotypes in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses, we can determine the number of genes involved in a specific mutation, such as eye color, body color, or wing venation and calculate the map distance between them. We can also use chi-squared testing in order to prove or disprove hypotheses of our findings. If it is concluded that two mutations are linked through a chi-squared test, the map distances between them can be calculated through the well-known techniques as discussed in the MCDB 306 lecture.

The marker I cross can offer information about sex-linked genes and their locus on the first chromosome. With a population from these three crosses combined, we were able to perform more accurate statistical analysis through the chi-squared test and determine genetic linkage or independent assortment of multiple allele genes than with the reciprocal cross F2 generation data alone. The F2 generation of the marker II and III crosses tell us if the mutations are located on the respective chromosome by a lack of simultaneous expressivities of the phenotype. The map distances between the mutations found to be on those genes can be determined through analyzing the recombinant data from the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses.

Materials and Methods
Once the flies were carefully removed from their feeding vials, and anesthetized with CO2, they were sexed. Virgin females could be obtained by clearing all flies from the vials and returning to collect and sex them within 10 hours of the clearing. Ten Crosses were then performed, each made in duplicate. Ore-R Drosophila was used as the wild type, U-2544 was used as the unknown mutant stock, and marker stocks I, II and III were used. As a parental cross, U-2544 virgin female were crossed with Ore-R males, this was called Cross A. A reciprocal parental cross was created between the Ore-R virgin females and the U-2544 males, Cross B. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker I males, Cross I. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker II males, Cross II. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker III males, Cross III. Once the F1 generation was scored and analyzed, Crosses A, B, and I were allowed to continue through an F2 generation, with the removal of parents within 7days of set up. Cross II had F1 Bl+ L+ males removed and Cross III had F1 Gl+Sb+ males removed, each to be backcrossed with U-2544 virgin females in new vials. The complete and detailed procedure is described in the MCDB 306 lab manual.

Results and Discussion
Crosses A and B
Table here
The F1 data above indicates that the gene for body color is recessive. This is due to the lack of the mutant appearance in the F1 generation of both Crosses A and B. It also indicates that the mutation is autosomal due to the appearance of the wild type trait in the males. Had the trait been sex linked, the males of Cross A would have received their only X chromosome from the U-2544 mother and exhibited the dark body phenotype.

The F2 data for body color produced a 3:1 wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. Since we can conclude from the F1 generation that the gene for body color is autosomal, it is not necessary to account a female to male ratio. For these results we hypothesize a normal segregation for the body color gene. The chi-squared value for this hypothesis was 0.2411. This result, under one degree of freedom, yields a p-value that is greater than 0.5 but less than 0.9. Therefore we accept our hypothesis of normal segregation for body color.

Table here
The F1 data for the wing venation is similar to that of the F1 data for mutant body color. The lack of appearance of the mutant trait in the F1 generation allows us to conclude that the mutation is recessive. The fact that the males of the F1 generation of Cross A forces us to conclude that the gene for wing venation is autosomal.

The data for the F2 generation yields a 4:1wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. For this data we hypothesize a normal segregation of the gene for wing venation. The chi-squared value of 9.67 with one degree of freedom indicates a p-value that is much less than 0.005 and therefore we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the wing venation gene does not segregate normally, and that it is linked.

Combined Results of Body Color and Wing Venation
The results of body color and wing venation combined produce a ratio that cannot be used to easily conclude whether the two traits are linked or whether they independently assort. Therefore we calculate a chi-squared test with a hypothesis that they do assort independently. With this assumption we calculate a value of 104.305. This result, under three degrees of freedom, yields a p-value that is much less that 0.005 and therefore the hypothesis must be rejected and we conclude that the mutant genes d and w are linked. Knowing this, we can calculate the map distance using the amount of recombinants in the F2 generation. Here we calculated that map distance between d and w to be 44.2 mu.

Table here
The F1 generation here provides us with the same information as found for the body color as well as wing venation mutations. We can conclude through the lack of mutant findings in the F1, we can conclude that the mutation is recessive. We can also conclude that it is autosomal due to the fact that the F1 males of Cross A do not exhibit this trait.

The F2 generation provides us with two new phenotypes, according to eye color. The red eye color is wild type and as such a parental phenotype. The same is true for the mutant parental white-eyed F2 flies. From this data we hypothesized that there were two genes interacting with each other in order to produce orange and brown eyes. The two genes o and b are epistatic to each other. This meaning that a wild type Ore-r would have o+_b+_ genes, homozygous or heterozygous, as long as one of each dominate gene were present to create the red eye. This would also indicate that our U-2544 would have oobb genes, homozygous recessive alleles for both genes involved in eye color. From this we state that the orange-eyed phenotype will be oob+_, homozygous recessive for the o gene expressing that it is epistatic to the b+ wild type gene. Similarly, we state that the brown-eyed phenotype will be o+_bb, homozygous recessive for the b gene expressing that the presence of two mutant alleles results in epistasis. Through Mendel's experiments with his peas, it is known that two genes that are independently assorting form a 9:3:3:1 ratio, given that each trait yields a 3:1 ratio. From the high amount of double recombinant phenotype in the F2 generation we can conclude that the genes for eye color are in fact not independently assorting but linked. This can be seen even without doing a chi-squared test by comparing the 9:3:3:1 expected ratio to the 10:1:2:3 found ratio. We calculated the map units between the two genes to be 43.6 mu.

Male Parent Backcross II and III
The marker stocks are used in order to verify chromosomal locus. The known mutations are dominant Cy, Bl, and L in marker II stock, and Gl and Sb in the marker III stock. These mutations are known to be homozygous lethal, which form what we call a balanced lethal system. The F1 generation of these marker crosses alone does not tell us anything more than that which we have learned from the reciprocal crosses. When males of the F1 are separated and crossed with U-2544 virgin females, called a male backcross, we can use the resultant phenotypes to determine whether or not the selected trait is on chromosome II or III. Because of the lack of recombination in male Drosophila, we determine that the mutant genes appearing with the marker mutations reveal that they are not on the same chromosome. For example, we found the gene d, dark body, to be located on chromosome III. This was discovered through a male backcross of the marker III F1 progeny. The genotype of the F1 male is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl Sb d, and it is crossed with a U-2544 female whose genotype is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl+ Sb+ d+. Since there is no recombination in male Drosophila, and any recombination in the female would not change the genotype, we can conclude that any progeny would have the wild type allele d+ in its genotype and be dominant over our mutant gene. If the genes were not linked, the fact that there is no recombination between chromosomes in males would be irrelevant. This backcross theory is relevant to any backcross. The results from our marker III male backcross indicates that neither the body color gene, d, nor the wing venation gene, w, appear with the marker III mutations. From understanding of what the male backcross can tell us, we know that these genes must be located on the chromosome III. It is seen that the eye color mutation does appear with the chromosome III mutations and therefore cannot be located on the same chromosome. We then conclude that the genes must be located on chromosome II. This information would be indicated by a backcross of the marker II stock, had it thrived. The cross failure was probably due to over exposure of the sensitive marker II stock to the CO2 anesthetizing agent. Because of this mating failure between any male progeny and the U-2544 virgin females, we must deduce the chromosomal locus through a process of elimination using other experimental and known information. Since we know that o and b are not sex linked, they cannot be located on chromosome I. It is known that o and b are not located on chromosome four. Now that is experimentally determined through male backcross that o and b are not on chromosome III, we can only conclude that they must be located on chromosome II.

Cross A, B and I Combined
Combining the found information of crosses A, B and I provide us with a larger population and more accurate data for eye color analysis. By performing a chi-squared test we can test a hypothesis of independent assortment between the two genes. The result had a value of 277.46 yielding a p-value that was much less than 0.005 and so disproving our hypothesis. From this we can conclude that the o and b genes are linked. We use the recombinant data to calculate a map distance of 45.3 mu between o and b.

Summary
From this experiment it is concluded that the eye color mutations are linked and located on chromosome II. The gene o has a genetic locus of 59.2 mu while b has a genetic locus of 104.5 mu. It was also found that wing venation and body color mutations are linked and located on chromosome III. The w gene has a genetic locus of 0mu and d can be found at 44.2 mu. Crosses A and B's F1 generations provided us with the knowledge that the U-2544 mutations were autosomal recessive. The resulting F2 generations from these reciprocal crosses allowed us to perform chi-squared statistical analysis proving that the body color and wing venation genes are linked. The F2 generation data also allowed us to determine that two genes are involved in eye color, that they are epistatic to each other. We also used this data to determine an estimate of map distance between them. The male backcross of the marker crosses was necessary to determine chromosomal locus. In the case of the U-2544, it turns out, only the marker III cross was necessary in determining chromosomal locus. Through this cross, we determined that w and d were located on the third chromosome and that o and b were not. The marker cross I gave us additional information in calculation of the map distance between the two eye color genes. Had our mutant genes been sex linked, it would have been necessary to find the chromosomal locus. The loss of the marker II cross was regrettable but not detrimental to our conclusion that the eye color genes had a chromosomal locus here, due to the fact that Drosophila has a limited genome, one of the main reasons for using Drosophila in genetic analysis. The following maps indicate the chromosomal and genetic locus of the unknown mutations as well as the loci of the marker mutations.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Mapping of Genes in a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster,"Abstract
Drosophila Melanogaster (the common fruit fly) is convenient as a model organism for use in genetic experiments. By analyzing crosses in mutant and wild-type strains of Drosophila, the mapping of genes can be accomplished. In this experiment, U-4182 was the mutant strain used. This parental mutant strain possessed a dark body color, white eyes, and incomplete longitudinal veination. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the inheritance patterns of these genes as well as to locate the position of the genes on the chromosomes. To accomplish this task, numerous crosses were performed. Reciprocal crosses between mutant and wild-type strains established the patterns of inheritance of the mutant genes. The crosses also showed that the eye color was actually controlled by two genes: orange eye (a) and brown eye (b). Both genes were needed to create red eyes. Crosses with marker strains M1 and M3 were used to determine linkage relationships and the locations of the mutant genes. Body color (d), orange eye (a), and brown eye (b) were all established to be on chromosome 2. Specifically, body color was at locus 48.5 map units (mu), orange eye was at locus 38.7 mu, and brown eye was at locus 58.9 mu. The location of the wing venation mutation (w) was inferred to be on chromosome 3. All of the mutations are autosomal recessive.

Introduction
Drosophila Melanogaster is useful as a model organism because it has a short life cycle of 10-14 days. Their short lifespan and small size make it easy to culture and relatively inexpensive to store large numbers of flies. Additionally, numerous mutant phenotypes are easily seen with or without the aid of microscopes so observing and separating the flies is not a painstaking task. Because Drosophilahas a very long history in biological research, there is a tremendous amount known about its genome. The knowledge about wild-type and marker strains will help in identifying where the mutant genes are and how they are inherited.

Ultimately, the purpose of this experiment was to characterize unknown mutations in a mutant strain of Drosophila Melanogaster. The goal was to determine the inheritance patterns of these mutations as well as to locate the specific position of the genes on the chromosomes. By comparing a pure line wild-type strain, known as the Ore-R strain, with the mutant strain, known as U-7812, distinct differences were found in the expression of body color, eye color, and wing venation. To find out how these three different phenotypes were created, various crosses were performed. In order to find out how the mutations were inherited (sex-linked verses autosomal; dominant verses recessive), reciprocal crosses between the Ore-R strain and mutant strain were performed. The progeny of the F1 generation underwent further reciprocal crossing to produce an F2 generation which was used to determine how the mutations are inherited. In addition to these reciprocal crosses, a series of marker crosses were performed using M1 and M3 marker strains (Note: Marker 2 was not available). The marker strains contain mutations with known positions on their respective chromosomes (M1 is the X-chromosome, M3 is chromosome 3), so they could be used to decide whether the marker mutations were linked with the unknown mutations. Female unknowns were crossed with males from the marker strains. An F1 cross was completed for the M1 group, while a male back-cross was performed for the M3 group. These marker crosses provided information to establish linkage relationships of the unknown genes and to assign each gene to a specific locus.

Materials and Methods
Four different strains of Drosophila melanogaster were used. All of the flies in the stocks are true breeding. The Oregon-R (Ore-R) stock contains wild-type flies have red eyes, complete wing veination, and tan-colored bodies. U-7812, the unknown stock with white eyes, dark body, and incomplete longitudinal veination, was utilized in every cross. The Marker 1 stock had crossveinless (cv) and forked (f) mutations, which are located on the X-chromosome. These mutations were eventually found to be sex-linked recessive. The Marker 3 stock had glued eyes (Gl), stubble (Sb), and LVM mutations, which are located on chromosome 3. These mutations were eventually found to be autosomal dominant. LVM flies express the same phenotype as a wild-type fly would; the actual difference is that an LVM fly has an inversion on chromosome 3. LVM is homozygous lethal and therefore serves as a balancer lethal system in the M3 crosses.

Cross A
10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 Ore-R males.

Cross B
10 Ore-R virgin females were crossed with 20 U-4182 males.

Cross I
10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 M1 males.

Cross III
10 U-4182 virgin females were crossed with 20 M3 males

Cross A: F1 crosses
15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of A were transferred into a separate container and crossed.

Cross B: F1 crosses
15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of B were transferred into a separate container and crossed.

Cross I: F1 crosses
15 male and 10 female F1 progeny from the parental cross of I were transferred into a separate container and crossed.

Cross III: Male backcross
15 Glued-Stubble males from the F1 progeny of cross III were crossed with 10 U-4182 virgin females.

All crosses were performed twice and all protocol in performing the crosses as well as the handling of all drosophila strains can be found in the MCDB 306 lab manual.

Scoring of flies
All flies were put to sleep using carbon dioxide gas. After all F1 progeny were hatched, 100 flies were scored from crosses A, B, I, and III. After F2 and backcross progeny had hatched, 200 flies from each F2 generation were then scored with phenotype data recorded for all crosses.

Results and Discussion
Cross A F1 Results
Table here
The F1 results as shown above support that there is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color, and eye color. If the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. This is because all of the F1 progeny are heterozygous for the mutant gene. Also, if the mutations had been sex-linked, then all of the male F1 progeny would be mutated. This is because males have one X-chromosome from their U-7812 female parent, meaning any mutations would be expressed. Neither of these patterns was supported by the data gathered, but autosomal recessive inheritance of the alleles was supported. Therefore, it can be concluded that all three mutant alleles show an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Cross B F1 Results
Table here
The F1 results as shown above support that there is a recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color and eye color. Like in Cross A, if the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. Distinguishing between sex-linked and autosomal cannot be done, because it is impossible for either sex to express the mutant phenotype. All F1 male progeny will receive their X-chromosome from their wild-type mother, so males will always express the wild-type phenotype. Females will be heterozygous for the mutant gene. Therefore, from this data, it is only possible to conclude that the genes are recessive. However, with the data from Cross A and Cross B together, it is possible to conclude that the genes are definitely autosomal recessive.

Marker 1 Results
Table here
It is already known that crossveinless and forked mutations are sex-linked recessive. For the Marker 1 Cross, all of the progeny were wild-type phenotypically. The females were heterozygous for the mutant genes, and the males were all wild-type because they received the wild-type genes from the wild-type mothers. Therefore, the observed data makes sense.

Marker 3 Results
Table here
It is already known that Glued-eye, Stubble, and LVM are dominant mutations on chromosome 3. However, since Gl, Sb, and LVM are homozygous lethal, mutant flies in the stock must be heterozygous at those loci (Refer to skeletal report to see the actual arrangement of the marker mutant genes as their arrangement is crucial for successful backcrosses). This means that the father has the potential to give one of two different genotypes during mating. Since the unknown female is wild-type for the three genes, the resulting F1 progeny should have two different phenotypes in equal ratios. The data gathered reflects all of these facts, because the F1 progeny are about half Glued-Stubble and half LVM expressing. The observed data makes sense.

F2 Results of Crosses A & B
Table here
The data above helped show three major things. First, it showed that the body color gene segregated properly and is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 3.1:1 (wild-type:mutant), which was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that body color is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .081 correlated to a probability of 77.6% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, body color is autosomal recessive. Secondly, the data showed that the wing veination gene segregated properly as is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 2.96:1 ratio (wild-type:mutant) which again was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that wing veination is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .013 correlated to a probability of 90.9% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, wing veination is autosomal recessive.

Finally, the F2 data shown above helped determine whether the two genes, body color and wing venation, were linked or segregating independently (combined table found in skeletal report). The data presented showed an observed ratio of 10.9:3.8:3.95:1 which was close to the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for two independently assorting genes with recessive mutations. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two genes are assorting independently. The X2 value of .898 correlated to a probability of 82.6% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, it was concluded that these two genes are localized to different chromosomes in the genome, so this accounts for the independent assortment observed.

Cross A and B F2 Eye Color Data Combined
Table here
The F2 data showed the expression of four phenotypes for eye color. The expression of the orange and brown phenotypes in the F2 progeny warranted the proposal that there were two genes controlling eye color. With four phenotypes, there must be at least two genes, but, because there are only four phenotypes, there should only be two genes involved. The genes expressing the orange and brown phenotypes were assigned the names gene a and gene b , respectively. The following table shows how the genes interact to produce the different colors.

Table here
If the genes were independently assorting, there would be a typical 9:3:3:1 ratio expressed in the F2 generation. The data does not support this, as there are far more white-eyes flies than orange-eyed or brown-eyed. Since having white eyes requires that both genes are homozygous recessive, the genes are unlikely to be assorting independently. The data supports that the two eye color genes are linked, so crossing over may be occurring in the female flies. It makes sense that the brown and orange eyes are least expressed because they are recombinant phenotypes. The map distance between the two genes can be calculated using the combined data of crosses A and B. Orange-eyed and Brown-eyed flies are recombinant phenotypes, so crossing over had occurred in the mother flies. The two genes were shown to be 21.3 map units apart (refer to skeletal report).

Cross III -- F1 Male backcross results
Table here
A male backcross is used to ensure that crossing over does not take place when it crossed to a pure-line unknown female. Glued-Stubble males were recovered from the F1 progeny, and they were crossed with U-7812 virgin females. Because of the way the genes are set up on the marker chromosome (refer to skeletal report), unknown mutations that are on chromosome 3 will never show up with Glued/Stubble (i.e. genes that are linked on chromosome 3 will not show up with Glued/Stubble). If the unknown mutation is on a different chromosome, then it is possible for the mutation to show up with Glued/Stubble. According to the data above, body color and eye color genes must be assorting independly from Glued/Stubble because the mutant forms of both genes show up with Glued/Stubble. On the other hand, mutant veination is never seen with Glued/Stubble, so wing veination must be on chromosome 3. The body color and eye color genes are therefore on chromosome 2 because they are neither sex-linked (which was found from Cross A) nor linked to chromosome 3.

Cross I, A, and B combined analysis
The data gathered (refer to skeletal report) shows that there is a linkage relationship between eye color and body color. If there had been no linkage, then the double-mutant, white eyes and dark body, would be expressed in the lowest quantity in the F2 progeny of crosses A, B, and I. This was not seen, as there were far more double-mutant flies than the recombinant orange or brown phenotypes. If the genes were not linked, then the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two eye color genes are linked on autosome 2. The X2 value of 341.6 correlated to a probability of much less than 5% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. This means the hypothesis of independent assortment must be rejected. This confirms that the eye color genes are linked on chromosome 2. With the combined data, it was found that the map distance between the eye colors was 18.9 map units.

Performing a three-point cross established the map distances between the linked genes of eye color and body color. Refer to the skeletal report to see a table with data for the three-point cross. By dividing recombinant phenotypes by the total number of flies, the map distances between genes could be calculated. The calculations showed a 9.8 mu distance between body color and gene a, a 10.4 mu distance between the body color and the gene b, and 20.2 mu distance between gene a and gene b. Mapping of these genes to their assigned chromosomes was accomplished by acquiring the location of one of the genes. The other genes were then mapped in relation to that gene.

Summary

The data presented above provides the organized conclusions of this experiment. It was shown that body color and eye color are linked on chromosome two, and that the wing venation trait was present on chromosome three.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,The Effect of Initial Carbon Dioxide Concentration on the Rate of Photosynthesis in the Aquatic Plant Elodea,"Introduction:
In the field of plant biology, one of the fundamental processes of life is photosynthesis. This process occurs through the fixation of carbon dioxide in the presence of water and may or may not require light (photosynthetic dark reactions can occur in the absence of light). The end result of photosynthesis is the production of organic materials, such as sugars and oxygen, which are necessary for the life processes of many organisms. Although the majority of plants carry out photosynthesis, they do so at different rates. The rate of photosynthesis is dependent upon several environmental factors, including temperature, amount of light present, amount of carbon dioxide present, and the color of the light. In this lab, the purpose was to manipulate one environmental factor to determine the effect on the process of photosynthesis. It was decided that the environmental factor to be tested would be the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present. Then a hypothesis was generated: An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present will lead to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and as a result, an increase in the amount of oxygen generated. Throughout the experiments, the aquatic plant Elodea was used to carry out photosynthesis. This particular plant is especially conducive to scientific experiments involving photosynthesis because of its ability to produce oxygen bubbles as it carries out photosynthesis, making it simple to monitor the rate of photosynthesis in an experiment.

Materials & Methods:
In this experiment, all other possible environmental factors, such as temperature, were kept constant, while the environmental factor to be tested was varied. To test the original hypothesis, different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a source of carbon dioxide, were used. Approximately three one inch sections of Elodea were cut with a razor blade. As the method of examining the rate of photosynthesis was counting the number of oxygen bubbles produced by the plants, special attention was paid to cutting the stem of the Elodea at an angle so that carbon dioxide bubbles could escape properly. Three graduated cylinders were each filled with 10 mL of solutions of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.0% sodium bicarbonate (pure water). These concentrations were accomplished by diluting a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate with distilled water. All solutions used room temperature distilled water; therefore temperature was not a factor that was tested in this experiment. The three pieces were placed in the individual graduated cylinders. The number of bubbles that broke the surface of the water for each cylinder was counted during a five minute time period, and the results were recorded in a data chart. This was repeated for a total of five trials, with new pieces of Elodea being cut for each trial. During each of the trials, a bright lamp stationed approximately one foot away was aimed at the three cylinders to help stimulate the process of photosynthesis.

Results:
For each of the five trials, the rate of photosynthesis was measured by counting the number of oxygen bubbles that was produced by the Elodea plant. Bubbles were counted as they traveled up the cylinder and broke the surface. Table 1 shows the data chart for the number of bubbles observed at each particular concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the five trials.

Table here
Table 1. Number of Bubbles Observed for Increasing Concentrations of NaHCO3, a Source of Carbon Dioxide

Afterwards, the average number of oxygen bubbles observed for each concentration of sodium bicarbonate was calculated. This data can be seen below in Table 2. It was observed that the rate of photosynthesis steadily increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased.

Table here
Table 2. Average Number of O2 Bubbles Observed for Each Concentration of NaHCO3

Discussion:
As shown by the data in Tables 1 and 2 in the Results section, the number of oxygen bubbles generally increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased. Thus, one can conclude that the rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the concentration of sodium bicarbonate. The results seen in this experiment are therefore supportive of the original hypothesis presented in the introduction of the paper. Since sodium bicarbonate acts as a source of carbon dioxide, one of the required starting materials for the process of photosynthesis, it was expected that solution with more sodium bicarbonate, and this more starting carbon dioxide, would lead to the production of more oxygen compared to a solution that had no sodium bicarbonate in it. Comparing the results seen with 0.0% and 0.2% sodium bicarbonate solutions (Table 1 and 2), it is apparent that there is a much greater amount of oxygen produced with the addition of more carbon dioxide at the start of the experiment. The average number of bubbles for pure water is less than 1, while the average for 0.2% sodium bicarbonate is 10.8 bubbles.

Based on the data shown in Table 1, it is evident that not every trial yielded ideal results. For instance, the results of Trial 2 show that the 0.2% sodium bicarbonate yielded 3 oxygen bubbles, an atypically low number for that particular concentration. Neither the 0.1% of the pure water solutions yielded any oxygen bubbles. There are several possible explanations for these results. As the rate of photosynthesis is measured by the amount of oxygen escaping in the form of bubbles from the stem of the Elodea plant, it is possible that there were problems with the stems of the plants. They may not have been cut at a sharp enough angle to allow the bubbles to escape, of they may have been blocked by some particles that were present in the plant. As the number of bubbles depends on the eyesight of individuals, it is also possible that human error is involved. Tiny bubbles of oxygen may have escaped the notice of the individuals performing the bubble counts.

In relation to the question of how photosynthesis is affected by the initial amount of carbon dioxide present, it would be interesting to further explore how different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate can increase the rate of oxygen produced. In the experiments described in this paper, a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate was used, so higher percentages of sodium bicarbonate could not be tested. Therefore, it would be useful to try percentages of sodium bicarbonate such as 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%. Based on the results seen in this experiment, one would expect that increasing the percentage of sodium bicarbonate present would lead to an even greater increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and correspondingly, more oxygen bubbles produced. However, one would also expect that once the maximal rate of photosynthesis is reached, adding a higher concentration of sodium bicarbonate would not affect that rate of photosynthesis.",95.76,81.12,65.49,76.7,6997
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Mapping of Unknown Mutations In DrosophilaMelanogaster,"Introduction
Drosophila Melanogaster, commonly known as fruit fly, was the organism studied in this experiment. Drosophila were ideal because they were small and had a life cycle of about 10 to 14 days. This allowed for many generations to be produced from crosses. Drosophila are diploid organisms that only have four pairs of chromosomes which includes three pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Drosophila were also ideal to study because they possess traits, which can be observed with a microscope, that were characteristic of the sex and genotype of the flies. In this experiment the pattern of heritance and the genetic loci of the mutations in body color, eye color, and wing venation in an unknown strain u4184 of flies. The unknown strain was crossed with a wild-type strain in a set of reciprocal crosses to determine if each trait was recessive or dominant and autosomal or sex-linked. The unknown strain was then crossed with three strains that each had different known marker mutations. The results from the F1 generation of these crosses and the results from their subsequent male backcrosses or F1 x F1 cross determined on which chromosomes the genes for body color, eye color, and wing venation were. The genetic distance between these genes was determined by the results in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses combined some of the results from the marker crosses by calculating the percentages of recombinants and parental types.

Methods and Material
During the first lab period, the traits of eye color, body color, and wing venation were observed in the unknown strain and wild-type strain using the microscope and CO2 according to the procedure described in the lab manual. The unknown flies had whit eyes, dark brown body color, and wing venation with short longitudinal veins. The wild-type flies of Ore-R had red eyes, tan body color, and wing venation with longitudinal veins that went to the end of the wing. During this time the differences between the female and male flies was determined. The male flies have rounder abdomens with the last two dorsal segments darkly pigmented, genital claspers ventrally on the abdomen, and sex combs on the first pair of legs. The female flies have pointier abdomens with dorsal triangular dark pigmentations and lack genital claspers and sex combs. After observing, two new cultures of unknown flies were made with about 15 females and 20 males each. The cultures bottle was placed on its side until the flies wake up so that they do not get caught in the food and die. These new cultures supplied a fresh source of unknown flies for later weeks during the experiment. Shortly after this, the adult flies in the eight unknown bottles and three wild-type bottles were cleared. Eight hours later 80 unknown virgin females and 20 wild type virgin females were collected as described in the lab manual on page 20. Clearing the adults and then waiting no more than eight hours to collect the females ensured that the females were virgins because they were not mature yet for mating with the males.

The next step in the experiment was setting up the set of reciprocal crosses and the marker cross using the collected virgin females. The first cross was Reciprocal Cross A which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 virgin females and 10 wild type Ore-R males. To perform the crosses the same procedure was used as described in the lab manual for the culture, but in this case the flies were from two different strains instead of one strain. The vials for each cross were labeled for identification. The second cross was Reciprocal Cross B which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 males and 9 wild type, Ore-R females. The third cross performed was Marker Cross I, which consisted of 25 males from marker stock I and 10 unknown U4184 females. The marker I male flies had the genotype cv f on their only X chromosome, which produced a phenotype of cross veinless wings (with allele cv) and forked bristles (with allele f). These mutations are sex-linked, recessive. The fourth cross was Marker Cross II which consisted of 30 marker stock II males and 10 unknown U4184 virgin females. The marker stock II males had the phenotype of short thin bristles (with allele Bl), lobed eyes (with allele L), and curly wings (with allele Cy) and a genotype of Bl Bl+ L L+ Cy Cy+. The fifth cross was Marker Cross III and consisted of 30 marker stock III males and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females. The marker stock III males had a phenotype of smooth (glued) eyes (with allele Gl) and short, blunt bristles (with allele Sb) and a genotype of Gl Gl+ Sb Sb+ LVM LVM+. The LVM gene did not produce an effect on phenotype.

One week later and once the vials all had a sufficient amount of pupae, the parents from all the crosses could be removed, killed with CO2, and disposed in the fly morgue. Because the fly life cycle is about 9 days, this step removes the parental generation and prevents breeding between the parental and F1 generation. During this time, the phenotypes of the marker crosses (which were noted above) were observed under the microscope so that offspring could be scored correctly. Also 40 unknown virgin females were collected according to the same procedure done before.

The next step in the experiment was to score the F1 generation of all five crosses and make a record. The scoring took looked at the phenotypes for sex, body color, eye color, wing venation, and the marker mutations. At least 100 flies from Reciprocal Cross A, at least 100 from B, and at least 50 each from Marker Cross I, II, and III were scored.

After scoring, the second round of crosses was set up. For Reciprocal Cross A 30- 40 male and female flies from the F1 generation were taken and put into a new bottle to make a F1 x F1 cross. This was done again to make a duplicate. The same was done for Reciprocal Cross B and Marker Cross I and their duplicates. For Marker Cross II, first a cross was made between 30 bristle, lobed males of its F1 and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females, and then a second cross was made between 30 curly males of the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females. For Marker Cross III, a cross of 30 glued, stubble makes from the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females was made and duplicated. These crosses for Marker Cross II and III are known as male back crosses. And one week later the adults were removed just as in the first round of crosses. Finally, the last step in the experiment was to score the F2 generation and the male back cross progeny according to their eye color, sex, body color, wing venation, and marker mutations.

Results & Discussion
Reciprocal Crosses A and B
The results from the Reciprocal Crosses A and B in the F1 and F2 generations shed light o the genes controlling eye color, body color, and wing venation. The reciprocal crosses allowed for the determination of the traits as sex-linked or autosomal, and dominant or recessive. For example, if a trait were autosomal, then the progeny of both Cross A and B should be the same because it would not matter which parent had which genotype since each is passed on equally to both sexes of children. This is not true for a sex-linked trait, in which the son inherits the x chromosome and its genes only from the mother. These crosses F1 offspring also indicated whether the traits were dominant or recessive, because the offspring of these pure-breeding lines would show the dominant allele in their phenotype. The results for the F1 and F2 generations for the Reciprocal Crosses A and B are discussed individually below for body color, wing venation, and eye color.

Body Color
Table here
From Cross A F1, the dark body color gene can be determined as autosomal, recessive. It is recessive because all the F1 is wild-type. This indicates that the wild-type allele masks the mutant dark color allele. The trait is autosomal because both the males and females are wild-type. If the trait were sex-linked then the males would be mutant because they would only have one X chromosome which they inherited from their mutant mother from a pure-breeding line. The F1 from Cross B only indicated that dark body color trait was recessive because the males would be wild-type even if the trait were sex-linked since they would inherit a normal allele on the X chromosome from the mother. The results form the F2 generations of Crosses A and B determined if the dark body trait alleles were segregating properly. If this data were tabulated again to look at the ratios, the following would be observed:

Upon Chi- Square analysis, the chi- square value was 4.38 with a p-value less than 0.05. This indicated to reject the hypothesis of light body color being completely dominant to dark with no more segregation the two alleles for body color. The rejection may have been because the dark body mutation does not have 100 % penetrance, or perhaps during scoring the newly hatched dark bodies were scored as light instead of dark.

Table here
Wing Venation
Table here
Based on the F1 results of cross A, the mutant wing venation can be determined as a recessive, autosomal trait based on the same reasoning used for the body color trait. The F1 results from Cross B only determined the trait as recessive, as it did for the dark body color gene. The F2 results determined if the alleles for the wing venation were segregating properly. Once the F2 results were combined and looked at in ratios, the hypothesis of normal segregation for a complete dominance of wild-type wing venation over the mutant could be tested. The following is the combined ratios:

Table here
The chi-squared value for this test was .0176 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of complete penetrance and dominance of wild type wing venation over the mutant venation with no more segregation between the alleles cannot be rejected.

Analysis of body color and wing venation genes together
To test if the alleles for wing venation and body color were independently assorting or if the genes were linked, the two traits have to be looked at together in the F2 results from the Crosses A and B combined. These numbers must then be made into ratios that can be compared to the expected ration for independent assortment. The ratio for independent assortment of the alleles for wing venation and body color must be derived from the obtained ratios, obtained earlier, of the segregation of the individual traits. The observed and expected ratios are tabulated below. Wt indicates wild-type, and m indicates mutant.

Table here
The chi-squared value for testing the hypothesis of independent assortment was .628 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of independent assortment cannot be rejected. The genes for body color and wing venation were not linked.

Eye Color
Table here
From the same reasoning used for the determination of body color and wing venation, the results from the F1 of cross A determined eye color as a autosomal, recessive trait, while Cross B F1 determined eye color as just a recessive trait. Looking at the F2 results for the eye color trait, however, made this trait a bite more complicated than the others. When observing the F2 of Crosses A and B, four eye colors were identified. There was red, white, and also brown and orange. Because there were four different eye colors, there could be two genes involved in the expression of eye color. Because there are two genes involved, the F2 results will determine the interaction between these two genes; the F2 results will conclude if the genes were linked or not. A hypothesis for the possible interaction is described by the following diagram:

Figure here
The presence of the a+ allele with the b+ allele complements to make the wild-type red eye color. However, brown was possible with the genotype of aab+_, orange was possible with the phenotype of a+_bb, and white was aabb. The data eye color from F2 of Crosses A and B is tabulated below.

Table here
From just looking at this data it is reasonable to say that the two genes for eye color are linked because the number of number of white eye progeny (aabb) the double mutant offspring for the cross between two a+ab+b parents, is higher than the number of single mutant offspring (orange of brown eyes.) If the two genes were independently assorting, the double mutant of white eyes would be the least of the F2 progeny. A chi-square test with this data and the data from the F2 of Marker Cross I for the hypothesis of independent assortment gave a chi-squared value of 115.51 with a p-value <<< 0.05. Thus, the hypothesis was rejected. And the data above was used to find the map distance between the two eye color genes, a and b. The calculated map distance was 39.6 map units.

Male Parent Backcross: Cross II and III
The marker II and III stocks were balanced marker stocks to keep the heterozygous stocks pure line. The pure-line was established with a balanced lethal system, in which being homozygous for the mutant alleles was lethal. For example, flies in marker stock II had a one chromosome 2 carrying Bl L Cy+ and another chromosome 2 with Bl+ L+ Cy. These alleles are for the dominant, autosomal traits of short thin bristles, lobed eyes, and curly wings, respectively. When a male and female from marker stock II mate, the offspring with both chromosomes carrying Bl L Cy+ are killed and so are those both carrying the Bl+ L+ Cy chromosomes. Recombination among the genes in the chromosomes were controlled by inversion, an introduced cross-over suppressor for females, and males do not undergo recombination. This balanced marker system was also used in marker stock III with their chromosomes: one carrying Gl Sb LVM+ and the other carrying Gl+ Sb+ LVM.

Marker Cross II and III used male backcrosses instead of F1xF1 crosses. In a male back cross, the male progeny from the F1 are selected and mated to certain homozygote genotype female (in this case an unknown virgin.) In Drosophilia, male flies do not under go recombination. By selecting the males form the F1 generation and using the homozygous unknown females, recombination should not occur. These crosses also used male back crosses so that all the offspring would be viable. This was true for the kind of backcrosses employed in this experiment because an unknown female was always used. The unknown female carried the wild-type alleles for the marker mutations and would pass them on to the offspring. So the male back cross offspring would never be homozygous for the lethal marker mutations. The back crosses conducted would indicate which genes were on the marker chromosomes 1, 2, and 3. If a certain mutation does not show up with a marker mutation in the male backcross progeny, then that mutation is linked with the marker mutation, and thus on the same chromosome. This is a result because no recombination should occur in a male backcross in Dosophilia. However, if the mutation does show up with the marker mutation in the back cross progeny then this would be a sign that the two mutations are not on the same chromosome. In this experiment Cross II did not produce any male back cross progeny, but the results for Cross III male progeny are below.

Table here
The mutant body color of dark brown and mutant eye color of white showed up with the glued eye and stubble bristle marker mutations, and this means that neither the body color gene or eye color genes were on the third chromosome. However, the mutant wing venation of four short longitudinal veins did not show up with the glued eye and stubble bristle mutations, so the wing venation gene was on the third chromosome.

Cross A, B, and I Combined
The results from the F1 of Cross A determined that the eye color genes were autosomal. From Marker crosses II and III, the placement of gene for wing venation was found to be on chromosome 3, while body color was not. Since body color was not sex-linked, the gene for body color must be on chromosome 2 (since chromosome 4 does not carry many genes.) The same was true for the two eye color genes. Another clue that the eye color genes and body color gene are on the same allele was the fact that only 13 white eyed light body and 69 white eye dark body F2 progeny were observed for the crosses A, B, and I combined. This was very different from the expected results associated with independent assortment of about ¾ of the white eye progeny to be light body and only ¼ to be dark bodied. In a tree-point cross between d-a-b (d is allele for dark body, a and b are alleles for eye color), the distance between genes was found by doubling the number of recombinants because the F1 x F1 crosses hides half of the recombinants. The distance between d-b was found to be 10m.u, a-b was 39.5 m.u, and d-a was 49.5 after taking the twice the number of double crossovers into account. Thus, d and a were on the ends and b was in the middle.

Summary
With the information from the five performed crosses and the information of the location of one mutation of the chromosomes given by the instructor, the genes for mutations for dark body color, mutant wing venation, and eye color may be mapped on the chromosomes of the Drosopholia .",57.44,28.23,8.29,2.76,17184
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Effects of protein deficiency on organ size in Mus musculus,"Abstract:
The amount of protein (standard animal chow and protein-deficient chow) accessible to mice was manipulated to determine if size of the pancreas, heart, and testes is affected by protein deficiency. Organs were harvested and measures of the organ mass/body mass, total protein, and DNA were determined and statistically tested for significance. In the no protein condition the pancreas mass/body mass ratio and pancreatic protein content were significantly lower than in control mice. In contrast, there were no statistically significant changes in organ mass/body mass ratio or protein content of the testes and heart during protein deficiency. Additionally, no significant differences were found in the amount of DNA in any of the three organs. The observation that total protein, but not total DNA, of the pancreas decreased during protein deficiency suggests that changes in cell size, and not cell number, are responsible for the decrease in pancreas weight during protein deficiency. Interestingly, the observation that testes size, DNA, and protein content are maintained indicates that in the face of the significant environmental stress of lack of dietary protein, reproductive capability is likely maintained with other vital life functions.

Introduction:
Organisms are constantly altering their diets in response to food ability, competition, predation, and a multitude of other factors. How do organisms physiologically change in response to variations in diet? Which physiological processes are affected when an Alaskan brown bear switches from a low protein diet of wild berries and roots to a protein rich diet of salmon returning to spawn? Countless other examples exist in nature where organism experience annual, seasonal, and daily differences in food availability. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of dietary protein deficiency on the size, and thus the function, of various organs in mice. The organ chosen for this study were the heart, pancreas, and testes, which play a crucial role in circulation, digestion, and reproduction. Adequate circulation is absolutely necessary for the transfer and removal of nutrients and wastes under any condition. Therefore, the prediction was made that regardless of dietary protein intake the mass (an indirect measure of organ function) of the heart would be maintained. In contrast, maintenance of the pancreas was expected to decrease during protein deficiency, since its major role in digesting dietary protein is non-essential under these conditions. The main focus of interest is the question of whether the mass of the testes of mice will be maintained when faced with protein deficiency. One could argue that reproduction is a non-essential life function and thus would be turned off when resources are in low supply. On the other hand, in terms of evolution the success of an organism is measured by its genetic contribution to the future. If environmental conditions appear unfavorable an organism may sacrifice its own health and biological needs in order to reproduce. A classic example of this occurs every year as salmon migrate upstream to their original riverbeds to spawn and soon after die. It is hypothesized that in mice facing protein deficiency mass of the testes will be maintained, since in nature mice have a rapid turnover rate and the success of the future generations may take priority over individual success. This issue can be more broadly applied to the field of ecology by observing how changes in diet effect organ growth. Prolonged periods of protein deficient diets may be a problem for organisms that inhabit temperate or artic regions where certain nutrient rich foods are not available throughout various time of the year. It is also interesting to infer the impact of diet on reproductive life histories.

Methods and Materials:
Experimental Design:
The 8 mice used in this experiment were on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle and kept at room temperature during the duration of the study. 4 days prior to the tissue harvesting, ½ of the mice were randomly selected and were switched from the standard University of Michigan rodent chow (LabDiet; Richmond, VA) to a isocaloric, but protein deficient chow (Dyets; Bethlehem, PA) and were given free access to the chow until the completion of the study. At the completion of the study, the mice were killed using carbon dioxide and the target organs were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Organ weight/body weight:
Measures of the body mass of the mice were taken before the harvesting of tissue and measures of the organ weight were taken prior to tissue homogenization to give the organ wt/ body wt ratios.

Measures of DNA and Protein:
Measures for total protein content in the organs was determined by homogenizing 100mg of tissue in 2ml of solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5mM MgCl2 and immediately sonicated for 15secs to further disrupt the tissue. Following the sonication the total protein content was determined spectrophotometrically using BioRad protein dye. Measures of the total DNA content were measured using a luminescence spectrometer and a DNA quantification kit from Sigma-Aldritch.

Immunoblot Analysis (Western blotting):
Equal amounts of protein were run on a SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and afterwards transferred to a nitrocellose membrane. The membrane was blotted with milk for 1 hr and rinsed to remove any non-specific binding. Subsequently, placed overnight into a solution containing antibodies for GAPDH or s6p (a ribosomal protein). The following day the membranes were rinsed and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr, washed, and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence. Electronic images of the membranes were taken and used for comparison of control and protein deficient tissue.

Statistical Analysis:
Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation and were analyzed using a 2-tailed t test in the program SPSS. P values <0.05 were considered significant.

Results:
In the pancreas the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio in the control condition was 7.51 ± 0.62 (mg/g), whereas in the protein deficient mice the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio was 5.53 ± 0.77 (mg/g) (Figure 1). Differences between the control and protein deficient mice were statistically significant and had a p-value of 0.007 (Table 1). In the heart the organ wt/ body wt ratios were 5.17 ± 0.24 (mg/g) in the control condition and 5.33 ± 0.31 (mg/g) (Figure 1). The heart wt/ body wt ratios in the control and protein deficient mice are very close and have a statistically insignificant p-value of 0.459 (Table 1). The ratios of organ wt/ body wt in the testes in the control and protein deficient mice were also statistically insignificant having a p-value of 0.572 (Table 1). In the control condition the organ wt/ body wt ratio was 6.57 ± 1.23 (mg/g), whereas the protein deficient mice had a slight larger ratio of 7.13 ± 1.41 (mg/g) (Figure 1).

To gain insight into the types of changes protein deficient organs undergo measurements of the total DNA (a rough estimate of cell numbers) were taken to determine if protein deficient organs contained less total cells and/or equal number, but smaller cells. In the pancreas, the mean values for the control condition was 0.82 ± 0.10 (mg/tissue) and the mean value in the protein deficient condition was .80 ± 0.09 (mg/tissue) (Figure 2). The numbers are not statistically significant and have a p-value of 0.769 (Table 1). In the control condition of the heart a mean value of 0.26 ± 0.08 (mg/tissue) was measured and a mean value of 0.22 ± 0.05 (mg/tissue) was measured in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). A statistically insignificant p-value of 0.404 was determined for the heart tissue (Table 1). The p-value of 0.637 determined in the testes was also statistically insignificant (Table 1). The measure of the DNA content in the control condition of the testes was found to be 0.51 ± 0.12 (mg/tissue) and a similar average value of 0.55 ± 0.09 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). In all three organs no significant change in DNA content was observed.

Measurements of the total protein in the different organs yielded results similar to those found in the organ wt/ body wt ratios. In the control condition of the pancreas a mean value of 38.43 ± 5.68 (mg/tissue) was observed and a mean value of 18.13 ± 1.96 (mg/tissue) was observed in the protein deficient subjects (Figure 3). A significant p-value of 0.001 was found between the control and protein deficient conditions of the pancreas (Table 1). In the heart a mean value of 76.00 ± 13.4 (mg/tissue) was measured in the control and a mean value of 68.63 ± 4.30 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient condition (Figure 3). The similar mean values in the heart lead to an insignificant p-value of 0.336 (Table 1). In the testes a difference between the control mean value of 65.60 ± 20.94 (mg/tissue) and the protein deficient mean value of 45.85 ± 9.19 (mg/tissue) was noticed, but a p-value of 0.135 failed to reject the null hypothesis (Figure 3, Table 1).

In the immunoblot for the protein gapdh there are no clear differences in protein expression between the protein deficient and control mice (Figure 4). This is likely attributed to the fact that gapdh performs various housekeeping activities, and is thus conserved. In the immunoblot for the protein s6p, a ribosomal protein, it is clear that protein expression in the pancreas is less in protein deficient mice in comparison to the control mice (Figure 5).

Discussion:
Much research has been done looking at the effects of nutritional stress on the body. For example, in a study on California voles it was observed that their choice of diet varied in breeding and non-breeding seasons. After giving the voles feed with differing nutrient content, it was inferred that nutrition plays an important role in reproduction (Batzli, 1986). Researchers hypothesized that various nutrients play a key role in an organism's reproductive success. The voles used in this experiment were fed either a diet consisting of grass seeds or a laboratory chow. The chow and seeds fed to the voles differed in concentrations of calcium and sodium, but not protein (Batzli, 1986). Voles fed the low calcium and sodium grass seeds reproduced less than voles fed a standard laboratory chow (Batzli, 1986). This experiment led to the belief that reproduction may be affected by an organism's diet.

Another study looked at effects of nutritional stress on sperm production in moths. In the study, the sperm count of moths fed a low-protein diet was compared to the sperm count of moths fed a normal protein diet (Gage and Cook, 1994). The results indicated that diet played a significant role in spermatogenesis as lower sperm counts were found in moths fed a low protein diet. However, the size of the individual sperm cells was unaffected (Gage and Cook, 1994). My results that testes size was maintained during protein deficiency do not fit the findings of this study, but the difference in results may be due to the use of different organisms with different reproductive strategies.

In the following study the relationship between survival and reproduction was looked at in zooplankton undergoing starvation. In the experiment it was found that in starvation conditions some species ceased reproduction and had higher survival rates, whereas some species maintained or increased energy allocation towards reproduction and had lower survival rates (Kirk, 1997). Furthermore, the results indicated that allocating energy production decreases resistance to starvation (Kirk, 1997). These findings suggest that if energy is devoted towards reproduction in times of low energy availability, individual fitness is decreased. However, if an organism fails to reproduce, genetically speaking, it makes no contribution to future generations. In species with a short life span like mice, individuals may die before environmental conditions become more favorable. This is why it was predicted that protein expression in testes would be maintained in mice fed a protein deficient diet. This study highlighted the fact that organisms possess different strategies for reproduction and determining whether reproduction will be maintained or decreased is dependent on the organism's life history.

Yet another study examined the effects of dietary protein on rats. In the study, pregnant rats were either fed a standard laboratory chow or an equal calorie low protein chow. The offspring of the rats fed the low protein chow had a lower mean body weight than rats born from mothers who were fed a normal protein chow (Snoeck, 1990). These results led to the assumption that in protein deficient rats, proteins from various parts of the body were being broke down for use and thus, contributed to the lower body weight in the offspring of pregnant rats fed a low protein chow. These results were additionally supported as a lower mean mass of 29.8 (g) was observed in protein deficient mice, in comparison to the mean mass of 29.8 (g) in the control mice.

Moreover, the effects of protein efficiency were observed in the protein synthesis in the livers of rats. The subjects used for research were either fed a standard laboratory chow or a low protein chow and the effects of protein deficiency were quantified by measuring the concentrations of mRNA in the rat livers (Pain, 1978). A significant decrease of mRNA concentrations was observed in the protein deficient mice (Pain, 1978). The fact that liver functioning decreased in this study led to the assumption that other organs would shrink in response to protein deficiency.

In taking all the studies into consideration, protein deficiency causes lower mean body weights as proteins from organs are broken down in order to maintain vital life functioning. The prediction that regardless of dietary condition the functioning of the heart would be maintained was supported. In all the measurements used to infer organ function ability (organ wt/ body wt, total DNA and protein content) no significant differences were observed between the control and protein deficient subjects. This is more than likely attributed to the fact that functioning of an organism's heart is crucial for its survival. If the heart fails to work properly a myriad of problems exist as a result of poor circulation. Metabolic waste and byproducts of respiration must be maintained at low levels in the body, otherwise the ability of an organism to adequately function is severely jeopardized. Furthermore, cells through the body need a stead supply of nutrients (glucose, O2, hormones, etcetera) need to be circulated throughout the body, and thus, due to its importance in circulation it was predicted that heart function would be maintained.

The results also clearly supported the prediction that functioning in the pancreas would decrease in protein deficient mice. A statistical difference was observed between the experimental and control mice in the organ wt/ body wt values and in the total protein content. This is more than likely due to the fact that one of the key roles of the pancreas is the digestion of protein and in the mice fed a no-protein diet digestion of protein was not necessary. If an organism is protein deficient, proteins within the body will be broken down in order to synthesize other proteins critical for survival. Interestingly, in the measures of total DNA content no statistical difference between the control and protein deficient mice was observed. Since DNA is localized in the nucleus of cells, measurements of the total DNA content of an organ gives a rough estimate into the number of cells. The similar means of total DNA in the pancreas and the rather large difference in total protein suggests that while the numbers of cells appear to be the same, the overall size of the cells seems to be decreasing in protein deficient mice.

The hypothesis that reproduction would be maintained during protein deficiency was supported by the results. The argument that when faced with an environmental stress reproduction would be shut down until conditions improved, was not statistically supported. However, although not significant, a decrease in the total number of protein was observed in protein deficient mice. The standard deviation for the testes was extremely large due to the small sample size and having a larger sample size may have yielded significant differences. Despite the problems associated with sample size, the results indicated that reproduction is high on the hierarchy of biological functions.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Prevalence of Haemosporidians in birds of Northern Michigan,"Abstract
In this study, the prevalence of Haemosporidians in birds of Northern Michigan was investigated with an emphasis on the parasite Plasmodium in passerine birds. Birds caught and banded by mist-netters were sampled for blood and recorded by species, net number, sex, age, and swab number. The total prevalence of blood parasites in the samples was 23.8%. Birds caught at the CEMA banding site had the highest prevalence of malarial infection, and the birds of the NOMA banding site had the lowest. Mann-Whitney Tests resulted in two-tailed p-values of 0.001, 0.762, and 0.003 for comparisons of prevalence between NOMA and CEMA, CEMA and SOMA, and NOMA and SOMA, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis Tests regarding bird age, location, and families resulted in p-values of 0.259, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively. Tests for sex showed no significant differences between prevalence of infection in male and female hosts.

Parasites in nonhuman animals offer insight in understanding and treating human parasites, and are thus frequent subjects of scientific study. Avian species of malaria were the first models for studying the biology of the human Plasmodium (Slater 2005). In fact, they are so similar that for a long time, there was doubt as to whether the parasites of bird and human malaria were really different (Manwell 1935). Studies by Waters and colleagues (1993) showed that Plasmodium falciparum , the most deadly infective agent of human malaria, was more closely related to avian parasites than any other species. Not only are the causative agents similar, but the symptoms of human malaria are also similar to those of bird malarias (Kudo 1971).

Previous studies have also attempted to compare the parasite-host relationship of avian and human malarias, plus evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of a system of many hosts and several multihost parasites (Gandon 2004). Co-evolution between the malaria parasite and its bird hosts have also been of interest. For example, studies of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper suggest that avian parasites do not hinder their hosts' reproductive success possibly because of evolution (Kilpatrick 2006). In addition, another Haemosporidian Leucocytozoon in ducks has been studied for its effects on brood size (O'Roke 1934).

However, avian Plasmodium in Northern Michigan has not been studied in much depth. Its prevalence in the birds should be between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995). The current study attempted to examine the possibilities of a trend in the incidence of various species of Plasmodium in groupings of birds according to species, age, sex, or size. Furthermore, prevalence of blood parasites in passerine birds were compared to those found in Mergus merganser based on previous findings of Haematozoa in Michigan (DeJong et al., 2001).

Methods
Data collection was carried out from July 10 to August 3, 2006 in Emmett County, Michigan. Birds were caught using mist nets, which were arranged in a loop formation with ten nets per loop. There were a total of three sites where birds were captured: NOMA (North Maple River), CEMA (Central Maple River), and SOMA (South Maple River). Data of every bird captured were recorded into organized data sheets, including information such as species name, age, sex, and net number. If blood was taken from a bird, the blood smear number was also recorded. A total of 189 blood samples were taken from a variety of birds; 159 of these were obtained through mist-netting, and the rest were obtained with help of Harvey Blankespoor.

Blood samples were taken from birds' feet using sterile lancets, and then slides pre-cleaned with acid ethanol were held against the small droplet of blood. The blood collected on these slides was smeared with the edge of another slide, then fixed in methanol to be stained later in the lab. Each fixed slide was immersed in Coplin jars containing Giemsa stain for 15 seconds, placed in distilled water for 15 seconds, and finally, rinsed quickly in two more jars of fresh distilled water.

Dried slides were viewed using the 100x power oil immersion lens. Observation of malaria within the blood cells was carried out by manually scanning the surface of the slide for five minutes (roughly 1000 red blood cells).

Prevalence of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected passerine birds by the total number of passerine birds examined. Overall prevalence was determined by dividing the number of infected birds by the number of total birds examined. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to calculate differences of the distribution of avian blood parasites and the intensity of infection between age, gender, and location of the species sampled. These helped to determine any relationship between age or gender and a particular infection and these analyses were done in SPSS 14.0 for Windows.

Results
The total prevalence of blood parasites in the samples was 23.8%. Table 1 summarizes the data of the 14 families of birds that were examined. The family Parulidae was most represented in the sample, but the Anatidae had the highest overall prevalence of infection and prevalence within the family. The family Parulidae also had the highest prevalence of infection within the mist-netted birds (Table 2, Figure 1). At species level, the Baltimore Oriole and Common Grackle had the highest prevalence of parasitic infection, then the Song Sparrow was next highest (Table 3, Figure 2).

Most of the birds caught were in their hatch year age, which also had the highest prevalence excluding the group of five birds which were of unknown or indeterminate ages; no birds of the second year category were found to be infected (Figure 3).

Birds caught at the CEMA banding site had the highest prevalence of malarial infection, and the birds of the NOMA banding site had the lowest (Figure 4). Mann-Whitney Tests resulted in two-tailed p-values of 0.001, 0.762, and 0.003 for comparisons of prevalence between NOMA and CEMA, CEMA and SOMA, and NOMA and SOMA, respectively (Tables 4, 5, and 6).

Kruskal-Wallis Tests regarding bird age, location, and families resulted in p-values of 0.259, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively (Tables 7, 8 and 9). Tests for sex showed no significant differences between male and female.

Discussion
The data from this study show that prevalence of avian malaria in Northern Michigan was statistically significant. The prevalence of infection in all of the samples collected was 23.8% and the prevalence in only passerine birds was 10.7%, which supports previous research that blood smears demonstrate infection rates between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995).

aemoproteus and Leucocytozoon are host-specific and are found within related species of a particular family (Fallis et al. 1974), but species of the genus Plasmodium are not as family-specific (Bennett et al. 1982). Results from the current study showed that Plasmodium was represented in five families. Birds of the family Anatidae had the highest prevalence of haemosporidian infection, but this is because of the ubiquitous nature of Leucocytozoon in that family of birds. The family Corvidae also had a high prevalence of 100%.

Prevalence among species also varied dramatically. One factor that may explain the variance is habitat preference of infected bird species. Mosquitoes are found much more often near standing water, which suggests that birds nesting and breeding near standing water should be more susceptible to avian malaria. The Ovenbirds of the family Parulidae are common in all woods with dry floor; the Northern Waterthrushes are mainly in conifer bogs, wooden swamps, and along streams in heavily shaded ravines; the Black-and-White Warblers are common in conifer bogs; the Nashville Warblers are common in moist conifer woods and bogs or open, dry woods; the American Redstarts are common in deciduous woods. The Hermit Thrush of the family Turdidae are common in semi-open woods, and the Veeries are common in densely shaded, often moist woods. The White-throated Sparrows of the family Emberizidae are common in the shrubby edges of conifer bogs and heavily shaded coniferous-deciduous woods, and the Song Sparrows are common in brushy areas. Black-Capped Chickadees of the Paridae family are commonly found in wooded areas. The Baltimore Oriole of the family Icteridae is common at the edges of open deciduous woods, and the Common Grackle is common near lakes and streams, particularly where there are pines and other conifers. (Pettingill 1974). Overall, some of the infected bird species prefer habitats that are potentially mosquito-dense while others do not.

There was a propensity for prevalence of infection to decrease with bird age except for birds in their second year (Figure 3). These data were inconsistent with previous findings which showed juveniles to be more susceptible to infection than adult birds (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Birds should be highly vulnerable to insect bites during the two weeks until they leave the nest because of their bare, feather-less skin, allowing an opportunity for them to be infected by Plasmodium. The small sample size of this study most likely limited the accuracy of the data; with a larger, more thorough sample, one would be able to better interpret the relationship of host age and haematozoan infection. Prevalence of infection was also high in the group of birds with unknown age, since only two out of only five birds were infected.

The prevalence of infection at the three banding locations differed from one another, and was statistically significant. This could be a result of birds having varying degrees of exposure to the mosquito vector. Birds caught in mist nets near water should show a higher prevalence of infection than those caught elsewhere. Possibly, the CEMA and SOMA locations had more mosquito-rich areas in it, and as a result reflected a higher prevalence of bird malaria in the data.

Tests for different prevalence in sex showed no significance, which is a result of inadequate data. Many of the birds caught in the mist nets could not be characterized for sex, because they were too young and juveniles are difficult to assess gender even with the expertise of collaborators of this project.

Prevalence of Haemosporidian infection throughout the birds of Northern Michigan varied significantly by host family, species, age, and location. There are many possible factors that could contribute to this: bird behavior, habitat, concentration of mosquito vectors, climate, or co-evolution (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Further studies that look into this would be useful in comparison to distribution patterns of Plasmodium species that infect humans. No conclusions could be made about the effect of Haemosporidians on the bird populations of Northern Michigan, but continued pursuit of this question could supplement data and make more accurate analyses possible.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Trunk forking in Acer saccharum: a phototropic response to forest canopy gaps,"Abstract
We examined trunk forking in Acer saccharumas an adaptation for filling canopy gaps. We measured diameter and distance to nearest neighbor around forked and unforked sugar maples and computed and compared the mean local basal area per sample area for these two groups. While these results were not statistically significant for each site, when taken together for all sites the data showed that sugar maples forked their trunks more often when the basal area around them was relatively low, indicating that forking allowed them to fill canopy gaps more effectively.

Introduction
Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a shade-tolerant, gap-phase species (Walters 1993). The growth of A. saccharum seedlings is typically restrained entirely by the limitation of light penetrating the forest floor by the canopies of overstory adult trees (Ricard et al., 2004). The seedlings persist on the forest floor as small juveniles for many years and grow quickly to fill gaps in the canopy created by disturbance (Marks and Gardescu 1998). The species has evolved phototropic responses to canopy gaps that allow it to avoid shade and quickly fill new gaps before its competitors (Brisson 2001). While in temperate North American forests A. saccharum is often found in conjunction with Fagus grandifolia (which is an even more shade-tolerant species), A. saccharum tends to out-compete F. grandifolia in the presence of very small canopy gaps by producing many short lateral branches that more effectively exploit these openings (Canham 1989).

The relationships of several phenotypic responses to light gaps have been examined, including stem orientation (King 2001), leaf structure and biomass allocation (Osada et al., 2004), root architecture (Cheng et al., 2005), and lateral branching (Canham 1988). Though a recent study showed that trees, particularly shade-tolerant species, displace their canopies away from their neighbors to reduce competition and maximize resource exploitation (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), the tendency of sugar maples to branch early and form two trunks to fill the forest canopy more effectively has not been examined specifically. This experiment sought to demonstrate the effects of canopy density and light competition on the tendency of sugar maples to exhibit forked trunks. We hypothesized that trunk forking would allow sugar maples to fill canopy gaps more quickly and efficiently than a single trunk by creating a wider canopy area to absorb the light energy in these gaps and shade out nearby competitors. We expected that a forked trunk would be more effective than a single trunk at filling larger canopy gaps, while a single unforked trunk would be sufficient to fill smaller gaps.

We tested our hypothesis by comparing local basal area per sample area around forked and unforked sugar maples from three sites that differed in species dominance and overall basal area. We predicted that each site would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees and that mean local basal area per m2 would be significantly lower for forked trees than unforked trees. In addition we predicted that each site would have a significantly different mean local density for forked trees.

Methods
We sampled three sites: Grapevine Point, Sedge Point and Colonial Point. We selected these sites because they had significant populations of sugar maples but varied in species composition and overall basal area. In each site we established a 50m by 50m test area. We sampled each test area with five parallel 2m by 50m transects. We established these transects within the test area at a distance of 10m from one another measured from their centers. We used the following parameters in the sampling:

a) A height of 130cm was used for every diameter measurement (Brokaw and Thompson 2000). b) In the case of trees of any species that exhibited trunk forking below 130cm, the dbh at 130cm of each trunk was recorded. These trunks were considered individual trees for the purpose of determining basal area and dominance within a site. c) Trees (or trunks) with a dbh of less than 5cm were not included in any aspect of the study. d) Only trees whose centers were within one meter of the center of a transect were counted as belonging to a transect. e) Trees with forked trunks were defined as branching into two or more trunks (each with a diameter of atleast 5cm) below a height of 2m. f) Distance between two trees was defined as the shortest distance from the surface of one tree to the surface of the next.
Within each transect we recorded the dbh and species of each tree. Every sugar maple encountered was recorded as being forked or not-forked, and we established a point-quarter system around the trees with one axis parallel to and the other perpendicular to the transect. Within each quarter we located the nearest neighbor and recorded its species, dbh and distance to the sugar maple.

We repeated these methods identically for each of the three sites. We calculated the relative dominance and basal area of each site from the transect data. We calculated the mean local density and basal area around forked and unforked sugar maples from the point-quarter measurements separately for each site and for all the sugar maples sampled in the study.

We used an ANOVA to analyze whether the mean local density for sugar maples differed between the three sites. We used a chi-square test to establish whether the proportion of forked and unforked sugar maples in the three sites was identically distributed to test the hypothesis that the sites would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees. We used a t-test to examine whether the mean local density differed significantly for forked and unforked sugar maples for all the sites considered as a population. We examined this difference for the sites considered individually with additional t-tests.

Results
Colonial Point was dominated by relatively large trees and the understory was open with no light gaps and few recently fallen trees. The trees at Sedge Point tended to be much smaller and the understory was crowded with saplings of Acer and Fagus. The trees at Grapevine Point were intermediate in size and there were a few saplings rising to fill recently created light gaps. Because there was more distance between trees at Colonial Point and there were fewer trees overall, its basal area was almost equal to that of Grapevine Point. Though the trees were smallest on average at Sedge Point, this site had a substantially higher basal area than the other two because there were many more trees present (Table 1).

Colonial Point was dominated by very large old beeches, and several smaller red maples and sugar maples were growing between them (Fig 1). Colonial Point had the lowest dominance of sugar maples of all the sites. Sedge Point had an almost equal balance of dominance by red maples, sugar maples and beeches (Fig 2). The beeches at Sedge Point tended to be smaller than the maples but there were more beeches overall. Grapevine Point was different from the other two sites in that over 50% of its basal area was accounted for by sugar maples. Unlike the other two sites, there were no adult beeches or red maples, and several large ashes and basswoods were present (Fig 3.)

The difference in basal area per m2 around the sugar maples between the three sites was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.013, however only the difference between Sedge Point and Colonial Point was significant (Table 2). All of the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked, while 47% of the sugar maples at Sedge Point and 24% of the sugar maples at Grapevine Point were forked (Table 3). The difference between these proportions was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03 (Table 4).

Unforked sugar maples had an average local basal area per sample area of almost double that of the forked sugar maples (Table 5). This difference was statistically significant for the sugar maples of all three sites considered together, with a p-value of 0.007 (Table 6). This difference was statistically insignificant for Sedge Point (Table 7) and Grapevine Point (Table 8) considered individually, with p-values of 0.172 and 0.084, respectively.

Discussion
The results of the ANOVA (Table 2), which showed that the mean local basal area per m2 of all sugar maples was only significantly different between Sedge Point and Colonial Point, are in reality not very meaningful because all the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked. It would be more meaningful to compare the local basal area per m2 for all forked sugar maples or for all unforked sugar maples between the sites, however this would almost definitely be statistically insignificant because of the small sample sizes. The importance of this comparison is questionable because we would expect there to be variation in these numbers between sites based on differences in overall basal area in each site. In addition it would seem logical to compare the local basal areas per m2 of sugar maples with the overall basal areas per m2 at the sites, as lower values for the basal area around sugar maples would illustrate their preference for canopy gaps. However it would be unsound to make this comparison because we calculated basal area per m2 in the transects and around the sugar maples using different sampling methods. The use of different sampling methods can lead to drastically different estimated densities, particularly when distribution is non-uniform (Engeman et al. 1994).

Because the canopy at Colonial Point was dominated by very tall, old trees that cast a thick uniform shade over the forest floor, it is not surprising that there were no forked sugar maples there. While it would seem unusual that the highest incidence of trunk forking occurred at Sedge Point (Table 3) where overall basal area was highest (Table 1), this site would also tend to have the most gaps because the trees in this site had lower basal areas and smaller canopies. This is supported by the fact that the difference between local basal area per m2 for forked and unforked sugar maples was higher for Sedge Point than Grapevine Point. Furthermore average local basal area per m2 for the unforked sugar maples at Colonial Point was close to the values for unforked trees at the other two sites (Table 5).

If the study were repeated, photometer readings would be taken randomly at several points in each site. Though more light would not reach the forest floor on average, a higher value for standard deviation in these readings at Sedge Point would show that this site has more canopy gaps than the other two sites. Likewise we would expect that though the similar values for basal area at Grapevine Point and Colonial Point should lead to similar mean light intensities at ground level, a lower standard deviation at Colonial Point would reflect a uniformly shaded environment for maple seedlings.

The fact that the difference between mean local basal areas per m2 was statistically significant for all sites considered together (Table 6) but insignificant for the sites considered individually (Tables 7 and 8), despite the fact that the means were almost identical for each site (Table 5), shows that the sample sizes were too small in this experiment. If the study were continued, doubling the sampling regime at each site would probably lead to statistically significant results. This would further establish the role of trunk forking as an evolutionary adaptation of Acer saccharumto quickly fill light gaps.

Our study showed that trunk forking allowed sugar maples to fill large canopy gaps more completely. This was an original finding, however it was consistent with previous research. Shade-tolerant trees produce more lateral branches in canopy gaps (Canham 1989), and orient these branches towards areas with higher light (King 2001). Therefore in large canopy gaps trees tend to expand their canopies by producing several large radiating branches (Canham 1988). If two or more of the branches of a developing tree were highly successful in capturing light, it would be logical for them to continue to develop upwards towards different areas of the light gap and eventually form distinct trunks with individual canopies. The leaves of these canopies would detect light competition by means of the red to far-red irradiance ratio (Aphalo et. al 1999) and the branches of the tree would behave autonomously and avoid one another (Brisson 2001). At this point the canopy of one trunk would respond to shading by the canopy of its other trunks exactly as it would to shading from neighboring trees (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), and orient its trunks away from each other and neighboring trees to minimize the interaction between canopies. As long as the individual canopies were successful in capturing light, all the trunks would be maintained with their canopies oriented away from each other to minimize competition and exploit all available light.

Further support for our results could be provided by long-term studies in which the development of sugar maples is observed over time. Sugar maples would be grown under experimentally created canopy gaps with known values of canopy closure, and the incidence of forking could be observed to determine a threshold gap size under which forking is induced. Based on our observations we would expect that the threshold local basal area per sample area needed to induce forking would be somewhere between 0.00222 and 0.00408, however the experiment outlined above would give a threshold value for canopy closure which would be more relevant because this value more accurately represents the light environment in the microhabitat of a seedling (Jennings et al. 1999).

It is interesting to note that we observed several sugar maples which had trunks that forked, but one or more of the trunks was dead and rotting. The dead trunks always pointed into the canopy of a tall nearby tree. This suggested that the dead trunks had been aborted because their leaves were not receiving enough sunlight because they were being shaded out by a taller neighbor. A long-term study, perhaps performed as a follow-up to the one described above, could be performed to observe this process and determine that in fact the trunks die in response to their gaps being filled by surrounding taller trees, and not the other way around. This would be done by blocking sunlight to one of the trunks of several forked sugar maples and seeing whether the trees abort entire trunks in the same way that they abort unproductive smaller branches.

Trunk forking is an adaptation that has evolved in certain canopy gap-dependent species that improves their competitiveness and overall evolutionary fitness. Tree species with the ability to alter their form in response to their light conditions have an advantage and will tend to outcompete those that are morphologically rigid in settings where environmental heterogeneity is high. An improved insight into trunk forking as a response to light gaps will increase understanding of forest succession and tree species' adaptations to varying conditions.",0,0,0,1.88,15210
Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Drosophila Melanogaster lab report,"Abstract
Closer examination of unknown Drosophila Melanogaster strain U3833 results in the observation of 3 mutant phenotypes. These observed mutations were white eyes, dark body, and mutant wing venation. Mutant wing venation resulted in certain longitudinal veins not fully traversing the wings. Variance in the expression of this mutation was also noted as the degree to which the individual vein was shortened varied. The dark body mutations was characterized with the body of the fly consisting of a black hue, while the eye color mutation was initially exemplified by white eyes, however, in the F2 generation both orange and brown became additionally evident. The location of these mutations was determined experimentally through the use of marker crosses and F1 backcrosses between F1 virgin females and unknown males. From these it was determined that the gene for body color was located on the third chromosome, while the gene for wing venation was on the second chromosome along with those controlling eye color. The mode of inheritance for eye color was determined from the F2 generation of cross A and B and I, which resulted in two additional phenotypes being observed. This corresponded to two genes controlling the expression of eye color. Furthermore, these genes were linked, as there is not a 9:3:3:1 ratio demonstrative of independently assorting genes in regards to eye color within these progeny. Between these two recessive genes homozygous b resulted in orange eyes and homozygous a resulted in brown eyes, while a fly homozygous for both genes expressed white eyes. Additionally, homozygous w resulted in mutant wing venation and homozygous d resulted in dark body both of which are recessive to the wild type allele. In regards to segregation, body color and wing venation consist of one gene and assort independently with a ratio of 9.7: 2.6: 2.1: 1. The recessive nature of each trait can be observed from the fact that all F1 progeny do not exhibit mutant phenotypes. Along with this, all mutations are autosomal as seen by the fact that in F1 progeny of cross A, no male fly exhibits mutant phenotypes.

Introduction
There are many reasons by which Drosophila Melanogaster is a model experimental model for genetic study. The first of which deals directly with the life cycle of this small insect. Only lasting 9 days, new generations are able to be generated quickly and coincide well with the timing of MCDB 306 class. Furthermore, as female flies can lay as many as 500 eggs in 10 days, the necessary population size for genetic analysis can be created and maintained. Another very important facet of Drosophila Melanogaster is the fact that upon emergence from pupa the female does not reach sexual maturity until approximately eight hours. This allows for the collection of virgin females for further crosses. There are also significant genetic advantages in using D. Melanogaster as well. Foremost is the fact that male flies do not undergo recombination and thus drastically reduce the complexity of scoring future generations. Additionally, the fact that this type of fly only has four chromosomes is also helpful in decreasing the number of chromosomal marker crosses.

The intent of this experiment was to identify the correct chromosome, locus, and mode of inheritance for three unique mutations through the use of designed crosses and statistical analysis. Given the dramatic increase in genetic study, experience in locating unknown mutations within a genome can be very helpful in real world laboratories. This understanding was obtained via careful adherence to established laboratory protocol. The isolation of virgin females and the ability to produce viable crosses with the selected flies was a vital piece in the overall goal of establishing a chromosomal map of unknown mutations. This could be determined only after performing a series of specific genetic crosses between precise populations of D. Melanogaster. Cross A and B were designed to determine if the mutations were dominant or recessive, while cross A showed if the mutation was autosomal or sex linked. For the crosses designated as marker, after executing the initial parental and F1 crosses, F1 backcrosses were performed with flies originating from specific marker populations exhibiting mutations with known loci. As each marker cross utilized populations of flies with different known mutations as well as cross over suppressing inversions, using the principles of independent assortment, though the observation of the progeny from these crosses, allows for the determination of the correct chromosome. A mutation's location on a chromosome can be obtained by statistical analysis of three point crossovers of three mutant traits.

Materials/Methods
With exception to a few altered details the overlaying procedure for this lab is described in depth in the MCDB 306 Lab Manual. The major difference is that due poor viability, the marker 2 cross was not performed. As a result only four crosses were performed. Virgin females were used when necessary in order to have a controlled cross as the female cannot have already been fertilized by a male prior to the initiation of a new cross. The crosses performed are outlined in the chart below. Additionally in preparation of the marker one and three backcross an initial cross of unknown virgin females and the respective maker males was performed.

Table 1: Cross summary

Results and Discussion
Cross A and B
Table here
Table 2: Cross A and B organized data

Body Color
From the F1 results noted above several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the progeny from both cross A and B. As in both crosses no mutant phenotypes were observed, one could determine that the mutation for dark body is in fact recessive. Furthermore, from cross A one is able to determine that this same mutation is autosomal. This is due to the fact that, were the mutation for body color located on the X chromosome, all male flies would receive only the mutant allele from their mothers, as the female in the cross is homozygous for the mutation. This cannot be determined from the B cross as the females in this cross will always provide an allele with a wild type gamete.

From the F2 results noted above, it was determined that the mutation for body color undergoes normal Mendelian segregation and consists of only one gene. This was determined by the analyzation of the ratios of wild type to mutant flies. The observed ratio as noted in the skeletal appendix was 3.35:1. With this ratio being close to the typical Mendelian ratio of 3:1 a chi squared test was performed in order to make sure the hypothesis of normal segregation is not to be rejected. Obtaining a X2 value of 1.18 with a degree of freedom of one and a probability greater than 0.05, it was clear that one would fail to reject the hypothesis of normal segregation.

Wing Venation
From the F1 data noted above it is clear that like body color, wing venation is also a recessive mutation found on an autosome. This can be supported by the fact that both the F1 progeny of cross A and B resulted in exclusively wild type flies being justified in a fashion similar to body color. Furthermore, similar to body color, one can conclude that the mutation is autosomal as all male progeny of Cross A were wild type for wing venation.

From the F2 results noted above, similarly to body color, it was hypothesized that this mutation undergoes normal segregation in a Mendelian fashion. Despite this, the observed ratio of wild type to mutant flies however was four to one compared to the expected ratio of three to one for normal single gene inheritance. Upon obtaining a X2 value of 7.67 (degree of freedom 1) and a probability less than 0.05 the hypothesis cannot be accepted. Despite this, it is possible that due to the variance in expressivity of the wing venation mutation a counting error may have occurred, thus accounting for the rejection of the hypothesis.

Wing Venation and Body Color
Table here
Table 3: Expected and observed ratios for wing and body mutation

In consideration of the relative location both wing venation and body color, as well as whether or not these mutations assort independently or are linked, it is necessary to analyze the phenotypic ratios. As shown above, the observed phenotypic ratio was 9.7 : 2.6 : 2.1 : 1, while the expected ratio of 13.43 : 4 : 3.35 : 1 was derived from the individual observed phenotypic ratio of each separate mutation. Having an initial hypothesis of independent assortment for each gene, a X2 test was performed. The obtained value was 6.13 and with a corresponding probability of greater than 0.05 (three degrees of freedom) one would fail to reject the hypothesis. Therefore, one can assume the two individual mutations are not linked and undergo independent assortment in a Mendelian fashion.

Eye Color
Table here
Table 4: Combined Data

From the F1 data obtained from the A and B crosses it was once again possible to establish that eye color was recessive and autosomal. This is due to the fact that in both cross A and B there were no mutant flies observed, illustrating once again the same pattern seen in the previous mutations of being recessive. Furthermore, from cross A it is possible to again determine that as there are no males exhibiting the mutant eye color the mutant phenotype is not on the X chromosome for the previously stated reasons.

From the F2 results it becomes clear that due to the presence of more than two phenotypes, there must be multi gene control over eye color. In the F2 generation eye color was not limited to red and white, but rather orange and brown became evident among progeny. With a hypothesized genotypic and phenotypic relationship seen below.

Table here
Table 5: Proposed eye color genotypes and phenotypes

Table here
Table 6: Final eye color observation

From analyzation of the obtained data a hypothesis of two linked genes was proposed. One can justify the linkage, as were the two alleles for eye color assorting independently a ratio of 9:3:3:1 would be observed in actuality however, a ratio of 5.98: 1: 1.2: 1 for red: white: brown: orange. Were independent assortment occurring the ratio of orange and brown would be expected to be significantly larger than that of white. Given that they are linked the map distance between the two alleles was determined to be 48.1 mu.

Male Parent Backcross III and II
The male backcross allows for the determination of whether or not a mutation is located on a certain chromosome. One is first required to perform a cross between a virgin mutant female and a male from an individual marker stock. The male progeny from this cross are then mated with unknown virgin females. Upon examination of the progeny from this cross, one can conclude that if the mutation in question can be observed with the marker mutations, then due to the principles of independent assortment the unknown mutation cannot be on the same chromosome as the marker mutations. Consequently if the unknown mutation is not observed with the marker mutations then one can assume that the mutation is on the same chromosome. Due to the low viability of marker stock II it was required that data for this cross be extrapolated from results throughout the lab.

Table here
Table 7: Cross III F1 male backcross

Table here
Table 8: Cross II F1 male backcross

From the given data, as the mutation for body color is not observed with the glued stubble marker for chromosome three, it can be concluded that this gene is on the third chromosome. Analyzation of the extrapolated data of marker cross two shows that both wing mutation and eye color are not observed with the maker mutations of Bristle Lobed or Curly. This can be determined since previous data concluded that these mutations are not sex-linked. Also from the data obtained from marker cross III it is clear that these mutations are not on chromosome three as they are observed with the marker mutations. Finally, chromosome four is eliminated as a possibility as it was stated that no unknown mutations were located on chromosome four.

Cross A, B and I combined
Table here
Table 9: Three point cross observed frequencies

Through the use of the previous marker crosses, it is clear that the two genes along with wing venation were on chromosome two. Due to the linked nature of the eye color genes and wing venation, one can use the frequency of single and double crossovers to determine the order and map distance of the genes in question. As seen calculated in the skeletal report appendix, the map distance between wing venation and mutant gene a was 89.9 mu. The distance between wing venation and b was 41.9 mu and the distance from gene a to gene b was 48 mu. Therefore the final gene order on chromosome two would be wing venation at 3.8 mu gene b at 45.7 mu and gene a at 93.7 mu.

Summary
The final assignments of each unknown mutation is as follows

Table here
Table 10: Final mutation summary

From cross A it was determined that each mutation was in fact autosomal. This was due to the fact that as the female in the cross was homozygous for each displayed mutant phenotype, were any of the mutant genes on the X chromosome, all male progeny would receive only the mutant gene and consequently express the mutant phenotype. As this was not the case, it is clear that each mutation was autosomal. From both cross A and B it was clear that as all F1 progeny were wild type, each mutation was recessive. From the F2 progeny of crosses A and B it was also made clear that body color was controlled by one gene and sorted independently. Wing venation, although controlled by one gene assorting independently from body color received a chi squared value that corresponded to a probability of less than 0.05 consequently rejecting the hypothesis of normal segregation. This error is most likely attributed to a counting error resulting from the varying expression of mutant wing venation. Marker Cross I, as it was already determined that no mutations were sex linked, instead was used to determine, along with cross A and B the mode of inheritance for eye color as well as the linkage between the two genes controlling eye color. From this information it was determined that eye color was controlled by two genes were only when both were homozygous were white eyes observed, when either gene a or b was homozygous the eyes were brown or orange respectively. Marker backcross III provides evidence regarding the chromosomal location of the dark body mutation, as it was not observed with the marker mutations in any progeny. Through extrapolation it was determined that both wing mutation and the two genes for eye color were located on chromosome two.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Small Mammal Response to Post-fire Forest Succession in Northern Lower Michigan,"Abstract
Fire can drastically alter forest ecosystems, and this can have important impacts on small mammal abundance, demography and community composition. Forest fire reduces the vertical structure of a habitat and changes the vegetative composition and coverage, leading to a reduction in moisture and greater temperature extremes. These effects can be mediated by the presence of coarse woody debris. We selected a chronosequence of naturally and experimentally burned plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (Michigan, USA) to investigate the relationships between post-fire succession and small mammal communities. We used vegetation/CWD surveys and 3 consecutive nights of live-trapping to characterize five plots covering a range of time since last burn (1917-1998). The percent of Populus grandidentata in a plot decreased with age while Pinus spp. and Quercus rubra increased in abundance with time since burning. We captured 3 species (Peromyscus leucopus,, Tamias striatus, Blarina brevicauda), and observed significant differences between plots in the abundance, age structure and reproductive condition of P. leucopus. The presence of reproducing adults was significantly positively correlated (P=0.037) with the presence of coarse woody debris. The high percentage of generally non-reproducing subadults in the intermediate plots may indicate a source-sink scenario, but the measured habitat variables were not sufficient to explain inconsistencies.

Introduction
Michigan forests have experienced fire as a result of natural causes, Native American agriculture and intense logging in the 1800s (Burt Barnes pers. comm.). After 80 years of fire exclusion, land managers have reintroduced fire in the form of prescribed burning in an effort to maintain fire-adapted ecosystems and combat invasive species (http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12148_25071-70073--,00.html). It is important to understand the impact of fire on small mammal populations and communities because these animals (Muridae, Soricidae) play a variety of important roles in forest ecosystems, such as feeding on invertebrates, seeds, fruit, and lichen, disseminating seeds and mycorrhizal fungi, and serving as prey for a number of avian and mammalian predators (Carey and Johnson 1995).

Clearcutting and burning can drastically alter ecosystems, with the most severe fires burning much of the vegetative cover and soil organic matter. Because recently burned ecosystems lack dense cover, they tend to experience higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures than older stands, which can make the habitat unattractive to sensitive mammals (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). The presence of downed woody material, which provides cover, moist microenvironments, runways, burrow sites and a substrate for food, leads to higher recolonization rates for rodents and insectivores during the first 10 years after burning (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). Additionally, the redevelopment of vegetation structure is associated with the reappearance of small mammal species (Whelan 1995). Some mammals may utilize the edge of plots because they prefer to exploit multiple habitats (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974).

Post-fire forest succession influences small mammal population and community composition. Species richness of small mammals increases over time, but levels-off after the first 30-40 years (Whelan 1995). In early successional habitats, the lack of complex/layered vegetation may result in interspecific competition that was not present before the fire, leading to reduced numbers of all species and a change in dominance (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). A source-sink scenario has been observed in some low-quality habitats created by fire, with more recently burned areas being dominated by non-reproducing individuals (Ecke et al. 2002; Buech et al. 1977 in Fisher and Wilkinson 2005).

We selected a chronosequence of naturally and experimentally burned plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) to investigate the relationships between post-fire succession and small mammal communities. Through live-trapping, we looked for changes in the abundance, diversity and community composition of small mammal species across the burn sequence. Additionally, we measured the age structure and reproductive status of individuals within each plot to look for the existence of a source-sink scenario. We also surveyed the vegetative cover and coarse woody debris (CWD) in each plot, which can be more important than the age since burn (Simon et al. 1998), so as to provide a mechanistic explanation for any observed differences in small mammal composition.

Materials and Methods
Study site
Our study was conducted on a chronosequence of experimental and natural burn plots (see Fig. 1) located on UMBS property (Section 32, T37N, R3W; Cheboygan Co., northern lower Michigan). We chose five plots about 1 hectare in size - one from 1917 that burned naturally and four experimental burns (1936, 1954, 1980, 1998). All experimental burn plots were clear-cut, with the poor-quality timber and slash left on-site and burned. The 1998 burn also includes a deer exclosure and has undergone yearly aspen ramet clipping in some portions. The entire burn sequence is located on a high-elevation outwash plain characterized by excessively-drained, acidic, sandy soil. Pre-settlement, the area was an eastern white pine- red pine - eastern hemlock - northern red oak forest, but extensive logging and 40 years of frequent fires resulted in the dominance of Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) in early successional forests, and it maintains a noticeable presence in older forests as well (White 2000).

Figure here
Figure 1. The 1998 Burn included a 50x80 deer exclosure. The 1917 plot was located to the south of the 1948 plot and to the west of the 1954 plot

Vegetation and coarse woody debris
We used a point-centered quarter sampling method (Anderson 2006) to survey canopy and subcanopy trees in each plot. Four transects 50m long and at least 10m apart, with 10m between point trees, were laid on each plot. From each point tree, we recorded the diameter, distance from point tree and species of one canopy and one subcanopy tree encountered in each NW, NE, SW and SE direction.

Coarse woody debris (CWD) was surveyed along 4 transects in each burn plot. Transects were 50m long and at least 10m apart. We counted any piece of downed woody material greater than 3cm in diameter that crossed a transect and noted its size category: 3-10cm and >10cm.

Grids
Trapping grids were set-up on each plot. For plots 1917-1980, trap lines were laid every 10m until reaching the edge of the plot, and folding Sherman live-traps (22.9 × 7.6 × 8.9 cm; H. B. Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, Florida, USA) were placed every 10m along the lines until reaching the plot border. We used the same procedure in the 1998 plot except no traps were laid in a 50x80 restricted area in the middle of the plot and some trap lines had portions located within the deer exclosure fence. The 1917 plot was 100x100m with 121 traps, the 1936 and 1954 plots were 70x80m with 72 traps, 1980 plot was 60x100m with 77traps, and the 1998 plot, excluding the restricted portion, was 5000 m2 with 69 traps.

Trapping and processing
Trapping was conducted for three consecutive nights starting 24 July 2006. Traps were laid out after 7pm the first night and loaded with oats. Each morning after 7:30am, traps with animals in them were removed during the day for processing, and empty traps were closed. We also noted the number of closed but empty, disturbed or missing traps in order to monitor the level of predator interference.

For each captured animal, we recorded the species, gender, reproductive status and weight. Additionally, a small portion of fur was clipped from a position on the back corresponding to one of the 5 plots, allowing us to determine if the animal was a recapture in the following days. Peromyscus and Tamias species were given oats and apples during the day, and Blarina were given worms. After 7:30pm, processed animals were returned to their trapping station, and all traps were re-set and loaded with oats.

Statistical analyses
All statistical tests were performed using SPSS 14.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Statistical comparisons were either a Chi-square test or a Spearmann Rank Correlation with a significance level of P ≤ 0.05. The data collected on recaptured animals was not included in the analysis.

Results
Vegetation & Coarse Woody Debris
The following species were encountered during our point-centered quarter sampling of the plots: Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), Northern red oak (Quercus rubra), Red maple (Acer rubrum ), Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), Red pine (Pinus resinosa), Paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and Amelanchier spp. Populus grandidentata was the most commonly encountered canopy and subcanopy tree overall, but its relative dominance varied between the burn plots, with plots 1917 and 1936 having the highest percentages of other species (see Fig. 2). The total basal area increases with age of plot (see Fig. 3), reflecting the larger size of canopy and subcanopy trees in the oldest plots.

Figure here
Figure here
The percent coverage by the most abundant tree species correlated well with the year of the burning in the plots. The percentage of P. grandidentata in a plot was significantly positively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=0.9, P=0.037). Both the percent composition of Pinus spp. and Q. rubra were negatively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=-1, P=0.000; Rs=-0.8, P=0.104). Acer rubrum also generally increased (Rs=0.7, P=0.188) with the year of the plot.

The amount of coarse woody debris >3cm in diameter differed significantly between plots (χ2 = 13.53, d.f. = 4, P<0.01), with plots 1917 and 1998 having the most CWD (see Fig. 4).

Figure here
Captured Animals
We captured a total of 136 individuals (not including recaptures) and 3 different species. Peromyscus leucopus (n=118) was the most abundant. We also captured a few Tamias striatus (n=15) and Blarina brevicauda (n=5; may include recapture).

On average, 49% of all captures on the 2nd and 3rd days were recaptures. All P. leucopus recaptured had been captured earlier in the same plot, except in the 1917 plot, where P. leucopus males were recaptured from the 1980 and 1954 plots as well. One Tamias captured in the 1980 plot was recaptured from the 1998 plot, but all other Tamias were recaptured in the same plot as their first capture. The majority of all recaptured individuals (77%) were non-reproducing (abdominal males or nipples tiny females), and this majority held for each plot.

In total, 154 traps were disturbed (see Table 1 for percent disturbed by plot), with the most likely predators being Procyon lotor, Canis latrans and Martes americana. One M. Americana may have been sighted in the 1917 plot on the 2nd day of trapping. Plots 1936 and 1954 were severely disturbed on the 3rd day of trapping, with 31% and 42% of traps disturbed, respectively. Canis lantrans may have been responsible for disturbing the 1954 trap lines on the 3rd day.

Table here
In order to make comparisons across plots, we adjusted the number of individuals captured according to the following formula, which puts all of the numbers in terms of 121 traps and accounts for the effect of predator disturbance:

Adjusted # = ((Total # individuals caught)*(3*121))/ ((3*#of traps in plot)-(total #traps disturbed))

Population characteristics
The abundance of P. leucopus was significantly different between plots (χ2 = 16.85, d.f. = 4, P<0.005), with noticeably fewer mice than expected in the 1954 and 1980 plots and more than expected found in the 1936 and 1998 plots (see Table 2). There was no significant variation across plots in the number of males and females (χ2 = 6.69, d.f. = 4, P<0.25), even though we often caught more males than females, especially in the 1980 plot.

Table here
The age structure of P. leucopus also varied significantly across burn treatments (χ2 = 20.2, d.f. = 8, P<0.01). There were more adults and fewer juveniles than expected in the 1917 plot, fewer adults and more subadults in the 1936 and 1954 plots and more juveniles and fewer subadults in the 1998 plot (see Fig. 5). While the distribution of weight classes did not vary significantly across plots (χ2 = 15.21, d.f. = 4, 0.05<P<0.075), they did roughly reflect the trends in the age data. There was a smaller percentage of P. leucopus in the 15.1-20g category (roughly subadult) for the 1998 plot, a larger percentage of >20.1g P. leucopus (roughly adult) in the 1998 plot than expected, and more P. leucopus in the 15.1-20g category than expected for the 1936 plot.

Figure here
We also found variation across plots in the reproductive status of P. leucopus. There was a significant difference in the percent of scrotal versus the percent of abdominal males (χ2 = 11.32, d.f. = 4, P<0.025) and in the percent of females with tiny nipples versus those with enlarged nipples (χ2 = 11.19, d.f. = 4, P<0.025). The 1936 plot had many more females with tiny nipples and more abdominal males than expected. The 1917 plot had more females with enlarged nipples than expected, and the 1980 plot had more abdominal males than expected. Figure 6 demonstrates that non-reproductive males and females tended to be in the same plot and visa versa. The highest numbers of reproductive individuals (reproductive adults and subadults combine d) were found in the 1917 and 1998 plots.

Influence of habitat characteristics
Spearmann-Rank Correlations indicated a relationship between CWD and reproductive status of P. leucopus. The amount of CWD >3cm in each plot was significantly negatively correlated with the percent of abdominal males in a plot (Rs=-0.9, P=0.037) and was also somewhat positively correlated with the percent of scrotal males (Rs=0.7, P=0.188). There may also be a slight correlation between CWD and the reproductive status of female mice, with non-reproductive individuals in the plots with less CWD (percent nipples tiny: Rs=-0.6, P=0.285; percent nipples enlarged: Rs=0.6, P=0.285).

Discussion
The burn chronosequence exhibited a progressive change in habitat, with the number of years since burning being highly correlated with the canopy and subcanopy composition of the forest community. The percent of P. grandidentata in a plot decreased with age while Pinus spp. and Q. rubra increased in abundance with time since burning. Because we only captured 3 different species (P. leucopus, T. striatus, B. brevicauda), we were not able to conduct a rigorous investigation of changes in species diversity. However, we did observe significant differences between plots in the abundance, age structure and reproductive condition of P. leucopus. In general, there were more subadults in the intermediate-age plots, more adults in the oldest plot and more juveniles in the most recently burned plot than expected. Overall, there was a higher percentage of reproductive females in the 1917 plot, a higher percentage of non-reproducing P. leucopus in the intermediate plots and no deviation from the expected values for the youngest plot.

The most coarse woody debris and the highest number of reproductive individuals were found in the 1917 and 1998 plots. This pattern is supported by the significant correlation of high levels of CWD with the presence of scrotal males. Further research should investigate the extent to which P. leucopus utilize CWD for nest-sites, runways, foraging, etc. in the burn plots. Casual observation indicated that several burrows were located near CWD and that large numbers of insects, a preferred food for P. leucopus (Wolff et al. 1985), were present beneath the debris in the 1998 plot .

We were not able to confirm the existence of a source-sink scenario occurring in the intermediately aged plots. However, the high percentage of subadults (the age for emigration) paired with the low overall P. leucopus abundance and dearth of high quality food sources (few oaks, pines and CWD), makes this a plausible explanation for some of the variation between plots. However, caution must be taken when determining what sort of habitat is acceptable for P. leucopus since they are capable of living at high densities across a wide-variety of habitats (Lackey 1978), and they are flexible in their food preferences (Drickamer 1976). Additional research should incorporate a ground cover survey in order to account for the presence and quality of fruiting shrubs, since these could comprise a major part of the diet of P. leucopus during certain parts of the year.

The 1998 plot may have been a more suitable habitat than originally expected (supporting high numbers of adults) due to the large amount of coarse woody debris, which has the potential to provide food/foraging habitat, thermal regulation and shelter. Additionally, the presence of P. grandidentata may have accelerated the recovery of the 1998 plot because aspen can occupy a site quickly after fire (through root-suckering) and aspen groves create more moderate temperature and moisture conditions (Burt Barnes, personal communication).

We did not observe much movement between plots. When we did capture individuals, they were males that had traveled from the intermediate plots to the 1917 plot, matching the literature findings that males often travel longer distances (Hirth 1959).

One important area requiring further investigation is the influence of post-fire succession on the suitability of habitat for the predators of small mammals. For example, martens are often found in the old growth stage (76 years+), but rarely in other habitats (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). The 1998 plot could have supported higher numbers of reproducing individuals and juveniles due to reduced levels of predation as compared to the 1917 plot. Overall, very little is known about the effects of fire on carnivores (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005), but the prevalence of disturbance in our trap lines indicates that predators are an active component of the burn plots. Different rates of predation could have an important impact on P. leucopus demography across plots.

Biology,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Relative Abundance of Myotis septentrionalis and Myotis lucifugus in Three Habitats in Northern Michigan,"ABSTRACT
The local abundance of Myotis septentrionalis (Northern bat) and Myotis lucifugus (Little brown bat) were analyzed in three different habitats in northern Michigan: wooded, river, and lakeside. Calls from each of nine sites (three of each habitat) were recorded using an Anabat detector, analyzed using Analyze 2.1, and identified by average frequency and end slope values. A discriminant function analysis was used to identify intermediate calls. Myotis lucifugus, traditionally labeled an aerial hawking species, was found in nearly equal numbers at lakeside and river sites (34 and 33, respectively). Myotis septentrionalis, a specialized gleaner, preferred to forage in the more sheltered wooded sites (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11). While both species foraged the most during the early hours of night, M. septentrionalis activity peaked earlier than M. lucifugus activity (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.251). The number of calls recorded for each species was related to neither temperature (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.105161) nor rainfall (Mann-Whitney, M. lucifugus P = 0.738 U = 1535, and M. septentrionalis P = 0.468 U = 1476).

INTRODUCTION
Myotis lucifugus and Myotis septentrionalis are two Vespertilionid bats that are sympatric over much of their ranges. Both occur throughout Michigan, and both are insectivorous. Morphologically these two species are very similar. However, M. septentrionalis tends to have longer ears and tragi. The tragus is more than half the length of the ear and comes to a narrow point (Kurta 1995). In M. lucifugus, the tragus is less than half the length of the ear and is rounded (Barclay & Fenton 1980). These species also differ in the frequency of their echolocation calls. The calls of M. septentrionalis are of shorter duration, higher average frequency, and cover a broader range of frequencies than those of M. lucifugus (Faure et al. 1993).

This difference in vocalization suggests that these two species have different foraging strategies. Myotis lucifugus is traditionally labeled as an aerial hawker that feeds primarily on aerial insects (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). The short, high frequency, broadband calls of M. septentrionalis are characteristic of gleaners (Schnitzler & Kalko 2001). A shorter call prevents overlap between the call and the echo at short distances, while higher average frequency and broader frequency range provide higher resolution of small objects.

Data has been presented demonstrating that both species can both glean and hawk prey, although M. septentrionalis tends to be more specialized for gleaning (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). Given that both M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis exhibit behavioral flexibility in foraging technique, and considering that they are sympatric throughout much of their ranges, it is likely that these two species segregate spatially or temporally in a way that reduces interspecific competition.

To test whether such segregation exists, we chose to study the relative abundances of the two species in three habitats: wooded, river, and lakeside. Of the three, lakeside sites are the most open, followed by the river sites and then the wooded sites. If the two species are segregating spatially, they should be found in different proportions and different relative abundances in the three habitats. Aerial insects are more abundant in open habitats. Thus, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of M. lucifugus at the lakeside sites where there were more aerial insects to hawk. Additionally, given that the calls of M. septentrionalis are more specialized for gleaning, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of this species at the wooded sites where there were more stationary insects to glean. At the river sites we expected to see roughly equal relative abundances for both species.

We then monitored how the relative abundance of each species changes throughout the night to determine if the bats exhibited temporal avoidance and foraged at different times. We also looked at whether or not there was a correlation between the relative abundance of each species and the weather conditions (temperature and rain). Relative abundance was measured by counting the number of call sequences recorded at each site and identifying which species each belonged to.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study Areas (see attached Fig.1)
Nine locations in the vicinity of the University of Michigan Biological Station (Pellston, Michigan) were chosen: three lakeside habitats (L1, L2, L3), three river habitats (R1, R2, R3), and three wooded habitats (W1, W2, W3).

All of the lakeside sites were on Douglas Lake and within walking distance of Biological Station facilities. Site L1 (45º33.65’N, 84º40.61’W) was located on the western edge of Biological Station facilities, about one meter away from the edge of the lake. Sites L2 (45º33.74’N, 84º40.08’W) and L3 (45º33.89’N, 84º39.88’W) were located on the eastern shore of Douglas Lake. Site L2 was 1 meter above the water surface and 4.5 meters away, and L3 was 1.8 meters above the water surface and 5 meters away. Site L3 was north of L2.

Sites R1 (45º19.74’N, 84º24.55’W) and R2 (45º32.66’N, 84º40.82’W) were located off of Hogsback Road in Reeses Swamp, along Carp Creek. Site R1 was 2.5 meters above the water surface and 11.5 meters away from the river. Site R2 was south of R1. Site R3 (45º33.47’N, 84º45.18’W) was located off of Pellston Plain Road by Maple River, 1.5 meters above the water surface and 1 meter away.

Site W1 (45º32.30’N, 84º42.06’W) was located on a seasonal road off of West Burt Lake Road. Site W2 (45º34.13’N, 84º39.05’W) was located on a seasonal road off of Robinson Road, to the east of the Biological Station. Site W3 (45º33.86’N, 84º40.79’W) was within walking distance of the Biological Station facilities and was located on Grapevine Trail.

Recording Procedures
The study was conducted for eight nights from June 25, 2004 through July 4, 2004. There was no observation on the nights of June 27 and July 3. The study ran from 9:00 pm until 5:30 am on each night of observation.

An Anabat II detector connected to a voice activated tape recorder was left at two sites per night. The first site was visited on the hour and the second was visited on the half hour to allow for travel between sites.

Temperature was measured with a mercury thermometer in degrees Fahrenheit. Wind speed was measured with an anemometer in meters per second. Also recorded were rainfall (no rain, light rain, or heavy rain), light (visible moon or no moon), and visibility (fog or no fog).

Call Identification
The data on each tape were recorded onto a computer using the program Anabat 5. The calls were analyzed using Analyze 2.1, which provided us with maximum frequency, average frequency, minimum frequency, curvature, duration, end slope, and start slope of each pulse in a call. Within each call, all of the pulses with a modal quality of 0.9 or greater were analyzed. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency greater than 50 KHz, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency less than 45 KHz, the call was attributed to M. lucifugus. If over half of the end slopes of the pulses were less than -10, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis.

Out of a total of 334 call sequences recorded, 289 were identifiable using the above characteristics.  The remaining 45 were intermediate or contained conflicting pulse values. These calls were subjected to a discriminant function analysis, which was based on 17 known M. septentrionalis and 18 known M. lucifugus calls provided by Mr. Matt Wund, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. This procedure classified 11 of the 45 unknown calls as either M. septentrionalis or M. lucifugus with a posterior probability of 0.95 or greater. These 11 were added to the identified calls, producing a total of 300 identified call sequences. Of these, 79 were identified as M. lucifugus and 221 were identified as M. septentrionalis.

RESULTS
Habitat Selection
Myotis lucifugus and M. septentrionalis are distributed differently among the three kinds of habitats (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11). The number of M. lucifugus is about equal at the lakeside and wooded sites and lowest at the river sites, while the number of M. septentrionalis is highest at the wooded sites and lowest at the lakeside sites. Myotis septentrionalis showed a greater segregation between sites than did M. lucifugus.

Figure here
Fig. 2- Proportion of calls made by each species at each habitat as related to the total number of calls made by that species. The two species show spatial segregation (P = 0.029, Kruskal Wallis, x2 = 7.11, n1 = 4, n2 = 5, n3 = 6).

Temporal Differentiation
For both species, the number of calls was highest in early evening. Myotis septentrionalis showed an earlier peak of activity than M. lucifugus (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.251). Myotis septentrionalis activity drops off by 1:00 am, while the number of M. lucifugus peaks again from 1:00 – 2:00 am.

Figure here
Fig. 3- Number of calls recorded for each species over time.

Figure here
Fig. 4- Proportion of calls made by each species by time as related to the total number of calls made by that species.

Weather
For both M. lucifugus (P = 0.738, Mann-Whitney, U = 1535) and M. septentrionalis (P = 0.468, Mann-Whitney, U = 1476), the number of calls was not related to whether it was raining at the time the calls were recorded. Additionally, the relative abundance of neither species was correlated with temperature (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.105161).

DISCUSSION
The absence of M. septentrionalis at lakeside sites and its abundance at wooded sites confirms that this species is specialized for gleaning and prefers to forage in more enclosed habitats, as indicated by its high frequency, broadband calls. This preference serves to separate the niches of the two species and reduce competition between them.

While M. septentrionalis prefers to forage in wooded sites, M. lucifugus showed less of a preference. The roughly equal numbers of M. lucifugus at lakeside (34) and wooded (33) sites suggest that this species is a generalist and will both hawk and glean prey.

However, 70% of all calls (211 of 300) were recorded at wooded habitats. The 33 M. lucifugus calls at the wooded sites made up only 16% of the total number of calls recorded at wooded sites. At the lakeside sites, the 34 M. lucifugus calls makes up 81% of the total number of calls recorded.

Figure here
Fig. 5- Relative abundance of each species at each of the three habitats. For each species, proportions are calculated as the number of calls recorded at a certain habitat as related to the total number of calls recorded at that habitat.

Thus, the relative abundance of M. lucifugus was the highest at the lakeside sites. The unequal proportions of M. lucifugus at lakeside (.81) and wooded (.16) sites further confirms that M. septentrionalis prefers wooded sites over lakeside sites. However, it cannot be concluded from these two pieces of data that M. lucifugus prefers lakeside sites, because M. lucifugus numbers at lakeside sites were equal to those at wooded sites.

Both species showed the most activity during the early hours of the night. However, while M. lucifugus becomes active again at about 1:00 am, M. septentrionalis numbers steadily decline and drop off at around that time. This trend may be related to being a gleaner. Because a gleaner must snatch insects off of stationary objects, it would be helpful for them to supplement their echolocation with sight. Further, because sight depends on the availability of light, using sight would be more effective during the earlier hours of the evening.

Rainfall and temperature data, neither of which was significant, nonetheless could have had an influence on the temporal data. Rainfall and temperature were recorded once an hour. Thus, calls recorded during an hour in which rainfall was observed were not necessarily recorded in the rain.

Another problem with the study arose from limitations of the Anabat II detector. The detector recorded only the number of calls, not the number of bats present. It is possible that multiple passes were made by a single bat. For each species, if the number of calls was evenly distributed amongst the number of bats present, then the number of calls recorded is indicative of the relative abundance of that species, and this problem should not influence our results. However, if most of the calls recorded were made by one or a few bats, then the number of calls was not evenly distributed, and this could have affected our results.

It would also be helpful to see if the spatial and temporal segregation we observed exists in areas where the two species are allopatric. If this is the case, then we can conclude that the segregation we observed is due to intrinsic differences between the two and that competition does not influence habitat preference. If, however, either of the species expands its foraging habitats (if either species shows no preference for any of the habitats), then the segregation we observed was due to competition.",0,29.45,38.92,42.02,13244
Biology,Response Paper,Undergraduate,Neurobiology Disease Explanation to a Parent,"Dear Dad,

I'm so sorry to hear that Mr. and Mrs. Friedson's son, Brian, has been diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited disease that causes a person's muscle fibers to be highly susceptible to damage, and over time, these muscles become weaker. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in particular, is the most severe of the nine types of muscular dystrophies, and it affects voluntary muscles (muscles used to purposefully move body parts), the heart, and breathing muscles.

As is the case with most DMD sufferers, Brian is male and was diagnosed early in his life (most are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 6). He exhibited general weakness in his hips, pelvis, thighs, and shoulders, and his calves were enlarged. He fell frequently and had difficulty getting up, running, and jumping. Mr. And Mrs. Friedson said that he had a waddling-like gait and wondered if he suffered from mild mental retardation. He was officially diagnosed with DMD following genetic testing and a muscle biopsy (where some of his muscle cells were removed and observed with a microscope). Prior to that, the doctors may have developed a suspicion of muscular dystrophy using blood tests, ultrasound, and electromyography.

The majority of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients are male because DMD is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are the small units of genetic material that carry traits, and half of a person's chromosomes come from each of their parents. Thus, each person has two copies of genetic material for each trait. Recessive traits, like DMD, are only observed if both copies of the gene carry the recessive trait. However, the genes that determine gender, the X and Y-chromosomes, carry different genes. Males have one X and one Y-chromosome, but females have two X-chromosomes. Thus, if a male gets the recessive trait on the X-chromosome from his mother, he will express it. Females, on the other hand, will only express it if both copies of the trait (one X-chromosome from her mother and one X-chromosome from her father) are recessive.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which is the result of this recessive trait. Dystrophin is a protein (a functional molecule in the body) that is needed by muscle cells for structural support. More specifically, dystrophin helps to anchor the internal cellular cytoskeleton (which is like a skeleton for the cell) to the surface membrane of the cell. Without dystrophin, the cell membrane, which is usually only permeable to water and specific other substances, allows other things to pass through as well. When this foreign matter enters the cell, the cell increases in internal pressure and explodes, which destroys the muscle cell-by-cell, essentially piece-by-piece.

DMD will probably kill Brian in his late teens or early 20s from problems with his heart or lungs. Although there is no cure, current medications (including prednisone) and therapies can slow the progression of the disease. In addition, current research on mice is promising and may lead to the development of more effective therapies in the future.

Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Social Impact of Roe v. Wade,"Although the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade has been described by some as a monumental achievement for the rights of women, others have criticized the Supreme Court for overstepping its powers and acting in the legislature's realm of control. Despite such polarized opinions regarding the Roe v. Wade decision, which sparked an organized backlash of opposition groups and an equally strong coalition of supporters, it has expanded the right of privacy found in our Constitution to include the right of women to control their own bodies. Although common law prohibitions on abortion were absent from the United States legal doctrine until the nineteenth century, an upsurge of anti-abortion laws during the 1800s resulted the criminalization of abortion in every state by 1880 (Rubin 15). However, the issue was left unchallenged until it became part of a larger women's rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, during which women began to assert their changing roles within society and sought to reclaim control over their reproduction. Although the issue of women's reproductive rights began as an essential element of women's fight for equality, it quickly turned into a complicated and heated moral debate, influencing abortion and privacy cases yet today. The victory of women's rights groups in Roe v. Wade did not end the battle over abortion with the Court's final decision; this case only served to generate increased contestation regarding the highly personal, religious, and moral decision of abortion.

Although American courts had previously followed English common law, which did not condemn abortion before quickening, the state at which the mother could feel the fetus move, well-organized pressure by physicians during the nineteenth century resulted in an dramatic increase of abortion laws throughout the states (Rubin 16). Opposition to the changing status of women within society and a desire to limit an influx of foreign immigrants from Eastern Europe and Ireland also influenced the upsurge of abortion laws during this period (Rubin 15). Despite the lack of concern surrounding abortion prior to the nineteenth century, the passage of these laws served to gradually change public opinion regarding abortion. Given increased public support for anti-abortion doctrines and the lack of power held by women in their subordinate positions within society, opposition did not form against such laws for more than fifty years. Despite the fact that an estimated one million illegal abortions were performed every year by 1962, with approximately 5,000 a year resulting in death, abortion was rarely discussed publicly because it carried a stigma of sexual misbehavior and immorality (Rubin 17).

Opposition to abortion laws took formation with the organization of a women's rights movement during the 1950s. This movement sought to obtain equality for women generally within society, and women's reproductive rights were viewed as crucial to such an achievement because the ability to obtain a safe and legal abortion when met with an unwanted pregnancy influenced a woman's capacity to compete with men in the work force. Women felt constrained economically, physically, and emotionally by the laws criminalizing abortion, unable to advance their status in comparison to their male counterparts. In addition, these strict abortion laws forced women to resort to dangerous home remedies, self-abortion, and back-alley abortions, which resulted in thousands of preventable deaths each year. A number of physicians also joined the movement to repeal abortion laws because they witnessed the consequences of incompetent and untrained individuals performing abortions first-hand. These advocates believed that doctors should hold the power to determine whether an abortion should be administered, not the law.

As a grassroots movement to repeal abortion laws throughout the nation began to organize, conferences were held to educate the public about the negative effects of the current statutes. Planned Parenthood and the New York Academy of Medicine sponsored a conference in 1954, followed by the publication of reports concerning abortion by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1958 (Rubin 18). In addition, lawyers joined the crusade for women's reproductive rights, concerned with the widespread disregard of the current laws and the blatant incompatibility of such doctrines with the social reality in which they existed. When laws are so frequently disobeyed and remain widely unenforced, they no longer serve a practical purpose, but instead work only to assert one group's control over another using the law. Criminal prosecutions were few and far between not only because most abortions were done in secret and women were usually only caught when they were injured or killed during the procedures, but also because abortion is a consensual crime and it was difficult to find women willing to file a criminal complaint. By the 1960s, the movement had began to draw national attention to the subject of abortion, as evidenced by the publication of articles in mass-circulation magazines and books designed for the general public concerning abortion (Rubin 19).

During this time period, other factors also influenced the increased attention given to abortion in addition to the women's liberation movement. Sex was being discussed more openly, fears of population growth were developing, and contraceptives were becoming used more widely (Rubin 19). However, the strongest advocates for the repeal of abortion laws were women themselves, who began to assert their newfound power within society to demand increased rights and recognition. Women's rights activists chose the path of litigation to accomplish their policy goals because legislative gains were susceptible to counterattacks and even reversal after their passage (Rubin 5). The first gain for the movement came with the passage of an abortion reform law in California following an outbreak of German measles, a disease that caused serious fetal damage, followed by a surge of abortions performed by California doctors. When charges were brought against nine doctors in the state, a Citizens Defense Fund on Therapeutic Abortions was launched in a number of states to raise money for the defense of the San Francisco Nine (Rubin 23). California State Senator Anthony Beilenson introduced an abortion reform bill in the legislature with support from Episcopal and Jewish organizations, women's groups, abortion counseling services, medical societies and individual doctors (Rubin 23). The reform bill was passed in California, as well as twelve other states, allowing abortion under certain circumstances, such as therapeutic abortion.

Despite the initial success accomplishing reform of abortion laws, the women's rights movement began to split along the issue of reform or repeal. More radical women's groups separated themselves from the moderate organizations, no longer seeing abortion as an issue that could be compromised upon, but rather as a right they must fight for. Organizations such as the Woman's Radical Action Project saw abortion as a matter of social justice rather than a private personal problem, encouraging women to speak out about their own experiences (Rubin 25). Women appeared at public discussions of abortion to protest the dominance of men leading such panels and organized marches and pickets. However, the grassroots movement to repeal abortion laws was not supported solely by women; broad coalitions were formed with lawyers, doctors, lay organizations and churches in an effort to bring a greater range of supporters and resources into the movement. Increased public discourse surrounding abortion served to eliminate the previous feelings of shame and guilt that had followed many women. Repeal became the goal for an increasing number of women's groups, as they saw the undesired effects of reform in many states. The reformed laws not only narrowly defined circumstances in which an abortion could be given, but also created significant obstacles for women of middle- and lower-class standings. According to Lucinda Cisler, Poor women often didn't know the new law existed, much less how to stretch it for their own purposes (Rubin 29).

Although the women's rights movement successfully formed broader coalitions with community members, lawyers, doctors, and churches and expanded public knowledge concerning the issue of abortion through the use of the media, success had yet to be achieved at the judicial level. The 1965 Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut opened the door for litigation concerning a woman's right to reproductive privacy. The case argued that a Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraceptives was unconstitutional, stating that the law abridged citizens' rights to privacy (Rubin 41). This decision increased the chances of success for advocates of abortion repeal because it found a right to privacy that had not previously been interpreted by the Court to exist in the Constitution. The Court defended its interpretation of such a right by citing the previous protection of rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, such as the right to free association and the right to educate one's children (Rubin 42). The newfound right to privacy created the conditions for the expansion of such a right to encompass women's reproductive rights as well, given that Griswold v. Connecticut could now be used as a precedent.

In 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States heard the case Roe v. Wade, brought by a group of three plaintiffs: Roe, a pregnant single woman; Hallford, a licensed physician; and the Does, a childless married couple. The plaintiffs brought a class action suit challenging the constitutionality of the Texas criminal abortion laws. Justice Blackmun, who administered the majority opinion, cited that the task before the court was to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and predilection (Roe v. Wade). Although it is an unstated duty of the Supreme Court to determine every case without bias or personal judgment, the power, breadth, and moral magnitude of this particular case made their decision increasingly difficult. Justice Blackmun stated the relative novelty of American abortion laws in support of the majority's decision. Prior to the nineteenth century, a law criminalizing pre-quickening abortion was absent from American legal doctrine, leaving the Court to find that it was doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus (Roe v. Wade). In addition, the Court concluded that at the time our Constitution was adopted a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today (Roe v. Wade).

Given the lack of an extensive historical restriction of abortion in the United States, the defense that criminalization of such a procedure has been ingrained in our country's history was void. Furthermore, the Court found that the newly discovered right to privacy was broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Although such a right to privacy over a woman's reproductive rights was declared, the Court was also obligated to protect the interests of the fetus and the state's interests to regulate health and medical standards. The Court's decision therefore reached a compromise: a woman's right to obtain an abortion, under the discretion of her doctor, during her first trimester of pregnancy was protected; the states were given reign to determine legislation restricting, although not prohibiting, abortion during a woman's second trimester; and the fetus' could may be found by the state legislature to preside over the woman's interests in the third trimester (Rubin 71). By providing some discretion and power for the state legislatures, the Court attempted to please both parties at once. Justice Blackmun stated that the right to privacy cannot be said to be absolute and at some point the state interests as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become dominant, portraying the Court as an objective body that has not swung completely to one side's favor (Roe v. Wade). The Court also sought to present its decision in a neutral light by describing the abortion decision as inherently, and primarily, a medical decision (Roe v. Wade). Taking into consideration the ramifications of their decision and its moral weight, the Court actively tried to present its opinion void of personal, religious, or moral influence. Following the Court's decision, Justice Blackmun stated in an interview, All we were deciding was a Constitutional issue, not a philosophical one (Rubin 78).

Despite the reversal of all current state laws criminalizing abortion, some feminists were not satisfied with the Court's decision, arguing that distinguishing the fetus' point of viability as the boundary for protected abortions tied women's rights to the current state of science, which could result in the elimination of a woman's right to choose when science makes it possible to keep a fetus alive outside its mother's womb at any stage of her pregnancy (Rubin 72). In addition, dissenting Justices Rehnquist and White argued that the majority's decision was effectively creating a new law, which was the responsibility of the legislative branch, not the judicial. However, at times in our nation's history it is necessary for the Court to enact such far-reaching decisions, regardless of the level of public support. The Supreme Court was originally created to act as an independent body, free from influence by the other two branches of government, in an effort to protect the rights of those members of society who are under-represented and overlooked by the majority government. Therefore, the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade may appear to overstep its traditional boundaries, but doing so protects the rights of individuals as guaranteed by our Constitution.

The Court's attempt to stay the middle ground resulted in backlash from both sides of the debate; women's rights activists were not pleased with the legislature's ability to still restrict abortions, and the Pro-Life forces were angered that abortion was no longer criminalized and could now be provided to all women. In the year following the Supreme Court's decision, sixty-two laws concerning abortion were adopted by thirty-two states (Rubin 127). These laws addressed issues of performance requirements, consent requirements, reporting requirements, advertising of legal abortions, public funding of abortions, and fetal protection (Rubin 130). An organized Pro-Life movement attempted to break away at the Roe v. Wade decision through its own use of litigation. In 1976, the first of these cases, Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, the Supreme Court invalidated the parental and spousal consent provisions of Missouri's abortion statute, stating that these requirements were in conflict with Roe v. Wade and the United States Constitution (Rubin 133). However, in 1981 the Supreme Court upheld a parental notification law for abortions in H.L. v. Matheson (Rubin 136). The issue of parental consent was addressed again in 1983 with City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. In this case, the Court overturned the provision requiring parental consent because it did not provide a procedure for mature minors to make their own decisions regarding abortions if their parents disagreed (Rubin 142).

Attempts were also made by individual states to put the fetus' rights above the interests of the mother during abortion procedures. In Pennsylvania, a statute was passed that required physicians to use certain medical techniques to save the life of a fetus that might be viable, even when these techniques could put the mother at risk. However, in 1986 the Supreme Court overturned Pennsylvania's provisions in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (Rubin 148). Although previous cases were unsuccessful at eroding Roe v. Wade, in 1989 the Supreme Court decision of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services upheld a Missouri law restricting the use of public funding, employees, and facilities in performing abortions or counseling individuals about abortions, which many considered to compromise the protection of abortion previously established by Roe v. Wade (Webster v. Reproductive Health Services).

The precedent set by Roe v. Wade was challenged once again in 1992 with the Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In its decision, the Court declared, No change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for its overruling (Planned Parenthood v. Casey). Despite persistent and organized efforts from Pro-Life coalitions, the Court insisted that regardless of medical developments that have advanced the point of viability for a fetus, this point remains the moment at which the State's interest may justify a ban on abortion. Although the Pro-Life organizations were unsuccessful in overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court did uphold the passage of their Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 in its 2007 decision Gonzales v. Carhart.

Although the women's rights movement successfully mobilized grassroots support and media coverage to repeal nationwide laws criminalizing abortion, their struggle did not end with the Roe v. Wade decision. An organized Pro-Life opposition formed in retaliation to the Court's monumental decision. The opposition coalition used the same strategies employed by the Pro-Choice movement and successfully passed several state statues decreasing the strength of the Roe v. Wade outcome. Given the determination of such polarized movements surrounding the heated debate of abortion, the issue did not remain in the realm of women's rights where it began, but quickly transformed into a national moral dispute, forcing politicians to declare their personal stances as well. The accomplishments achieved by the Pro-Choice and women's liberation movements exhibit the capacity to produce social change through persistence, networking, political involvement and the use of the media. However, the enforcement of a judicial decision may prove to be more difficult than expected, as in the case of Roe v. Wade. Widespread and structured right-wing Conservative opposition has revealed the contrasting positions that have developed within our nation regarding moral issues that have permeated politics. However, the example of Roe v. Wade depicts the need for litigation to bring about social change in the face of public resistance.

Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The E.U.: An Intergovernmental Organization with Supranational Aspirations,"There is no easy answer to the question of whether the European Union is intergovernmental or supranational, nor is there an easy answer to the question of whether it should be. Yet, careful analysis reveals that the structure and authority of the European Union as it stands mark it as a primarily intergovernmental institution. Conversely, a supranational structure seems to make the most sense with the collective European interest in economic, foreign, and domestic policy in mind.

Empirical Analysis
I. Institutions
The European Union is composed of five major institutions: the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Court of Justice. Of the five, the Council and Council of Ministers are strongly intergovernmental in nature, while the others tend toward a supranational focus. The institutions are quite diverse in their composition and policy goals, yet the ultimate authority in decision-making rests within the strongly intergovernmental institutions. As such, the institutional structure of the E.U argues more convincingly for an intergovernmental approach.

The European Council is almost definitionally an intergovernmental institution. It is composed of the heads of government of each of the E.U. member-states, who meet in semi-regular summits to discuss broad policy goals for the Union. The interactions of the council are characterized by the sort of bargaining, concession, and discussion characteristic of any international summit. Though the policies reached may advance the cause of European integration, the decision-making process of the Council is distinctly a reflection of realist thought. States act largely in their own self-interest, and any compromise of that self-interest is likely a bargaining concession. As the central actor in E.U. politics and the most powerful institution in the Union, the Council casts a long shadow of intergovernmental oversight over any supranational institution or policy.

Quite like the European Council, the Council of Ministers is composed of actors with the national interest as their number one priority. It is composed of appointed ministers from national governments, with each representing their state in the relevant, secondary council. Also like the European Council, the Council of Ministers is quite powerful, as it is in many ways . . . more like the legislature of the E.U. than the European Parliament, (McCormick 89). The Council of Ministers, along with the Parliament, is charged with amendment and approval of Commission proposals. Thus, while the European Council exerts broad control over the E.U. agenda, it is the Council of Ministers that is charged with the specific power to approve or deny a proposal. Acting in this capacity, the Council of Ministers can act as an impediment to the progress of integration. Armed with significant legislative powers and characterized by a spirit of diplomatic bargaining and singular pursuit of national interest, the Council of Ministers is another intergovernmental stumbling block to full, supranational integration in the E.U.

The European Commission is a bit like a mirror image of the European Council. It is the most supranational of E.U. institutions, acting as the steward of the collective European interest. The Commission consists of twenty-seven Commissioners—one from each country. Though the Commissioners are appointed by their own national government, they are not national representatives, and they must swear an oath of office saying that they will renounce any defence of national interests, (McCormick 84). Thus bound to serve the general interests of the E.U., the Commission is able to advance integration in a number of ways. The Commission is responsible for drafting new legislation, encouraging or compelling implementation of E.U. policies in member-states, managing the finances of the E.U., and external relations (McCormick). It is in its role as the initiator of new policies that the Commission has made its presence most felt in the recent past. Beginning with the Delors Commission in the mid 80s, the Commission has been a key source of integration through supranational means. The resulting policies—most notably the Single European Act—are the products of cooperation and common interest, rather than bargaining in light of competing interests. The Commission is the prime example of supranational governance in Europe, and has been and will continue to be a key catalyst for European integration.

The European Parliament is another primarily supranational institution of the European Union. Though it is the only body of the European Union directly elected by citizens in E.U. member-states, the Parliament is ultimately ineffectual due to a lack of authority and insufficient credibility. The Parliament is composed of representatives from each of the constituent states, with the seats divvied up roughly by population. Its responsibilities are probably the least significant of any of the major E.U. institutions. The Parliament cannot introduce legislation, and shares its powers of amendment and approval with the Council of Ministers. It has limited budgetary authority and some small supervisory responsibilities. Though the Parliament's role in E.U. decision-making is certainly growing, it remains, at the moment, the least effective major institution.

The Court of Justice is a strongly supranational institution. Though the twenty-appointed justices are national appointees, independence from said member-state is a requirement of the position, and promotion of national interest is prohibited. The Court's charge is to make sure that national and European laws . . . meet the terms and the spirit of the treaties, and that E.U. law is equally, fairly, and consistently applied throughout the member states, (McCormick 100). In practice, the Court often finds itself representing the interests of European integration over the interest of national sovereignty. In asserting the primacy of European law in areas of E.U. competence, the Court acts a protector of supranational institutions and legislation and the collective European interest.

Clearly there is great diversity in the five major E.U. institutions. The structure of the European Union is neither completely intergovernmental, nor entirely supranational. Yet, the greatest power in terms of both sweeping vision (the European Council) and specific legislative authority (Council of Ministers) lies with the intergovernmental institutions. As such, the general institutional structure of the European Union tends toward an intergovernmental interpretation.

II. Policy Areas
The European Union exerts some level of control over a wide range of policy areas. In some it exerts almost complete control at the supranational level (economic policy), while in others it has next to no influence (foreign and defense policy). A host of other issues lie somewhere in between these two poles, yet ultimately tend toward an intergovernmental character.

The collective economic policy of the European Union is one of the great success stories of European integration and the prototype for effective supranational governance. Pursuit of a single, free European market has been a goal of European integration since its inception as the European Coal & Steel Community. Though small steps in that direction were taken over the following decades, it was the passing of the Single European Act (SEA) in the mid 80s that signaled the realization of the single market was imminent. The act strove to eliminate all remaining non-tarriff barriers to the free movement of people, money, goods, and services . . . [taking] three main forms: physical, fiscal, and technical, (McCormick 159). The removal of these barriers necessitated an encroachment on the traditional domain of the nation-state. It threatened the territorial integrity of the nation-state, held influence over certain tax rates, and took control of product standards and regulations. The implementation of the single market represented a clear shift toward supranationalism in European economic policy. Besides asserting the primacy of the E.U. in economic matters, the act itself was the brainchild of the Delors Commission, the most supranational of E.U. institutions. The Single European Act and the resulting single European market are products of supranational administration and manifestations of supranational policies.

The implementation of the Euro in thirteen E.U. member-states is another proud moment in the history of European integration and the proliferation of supranational governance and policy. The implementation of the European monetary union required participants to meet certain convergence criteria, at which point they would relinquish control of exchange rate policy to the European Central Bank. Not only did these convergence criteria amount to E.U. control over national monetary policies, but the idea once again originated in the highly supranational Delors Commission. The hand-over of exchange rate policy control to the European Central Bank was an even greater concession, representing a clear and significant surrender of authority from the nation-state to the European Union. Though the Euro is not yet implemented across the European Union and has not been without its failures, it has helped to stabilize exchange rates for the single market, facilitated greater and fairer competition across borders, and placed European currency on the same level as the U.S. Dollar or the Japanese Yen (McCormick). Again, the unification of European monetary policy is both the product of supranational governance and an example of supranational policy in practice.

Attempts to build a coherent foreign policy within the E.U. have failed repeatedly to achieve anything close to a unified voice to the world. Initial attempts at foreign policy coordination, such as the European Defence Community (EDC) and European Political Cooperation (EPC) failed to have a noticeable effect and remained strongly intergovernmental in their structure. The current incarnation is the Common Security and Foreign Policy (CSFP), implemented by the Maastricht Treaty. Though CSFP has made some minor progress in coordinating policy, it has woefully underperformed with major issues—Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq War—on the table. Even if the CSFP were to perform up to expectations, it would still be undoubtedly an intergovernmental institution. Despite recent efforts to remedy this problem, the CSFP is implemented largely through the highly intergovernmental Council of Ministers, and, thus, is prone to disputes in the name of national interest (McCormick). A cogent, unified E.U. foreign policy is far from realization. The institutions in place today are not up to the task, national leaders will be loath to relinquish this primary duty of the nation-state (the protection of its people), and foreign policy goals vary significantly from nation to nation. European foreign policy as it stands could not be described as anything but strongly intergovernmental.

A wide range of domestic policy areas lie somewhere between the stark contrast of supranational economic policy and intergovernmental foreign policy. Agricultural policy has long been an important facet of European integration. The long-standing and quite successful Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is built on the promotion of a single market in [agriculture] . . . advantages to EU produce over imported produce, and joint financing, (McCormick 189). These goals for E.U. agriculture policy are supranational, focusing on the integration of separate markets and a common financial burden. Yet, the implementation of agriculture policy has strong ties to intergovernmental bargaining, as the current system of subsidies was born from French pursuit of national interest. The E.U.'s regional policy is a largely supranational undertaking. Designed to narrow the economic gap between the rich states of Western Europe and the poorer states of Eastern Europe, the joint E.U. approach has resulted in more efficient and effective regional aid. Clearly, this aid program places the interests of Europe collectively (the integrity of the single market, the success of some lesser members) over the national interest of the contributing nations. Finally, in environmental policy strong attempts have been made to establish a supranational authority, as problems like pollution or global warming transcend national boundaries. Despite this, the E.U. has been unable to fully implement a sound environmental policy across the member-states. Suggestions that the E.U. should be given powers to inspect and force compliance on environmental policy have been met with worries about loss of sovereignty and 'interference' . . . in the domestic affairs of member states, (McCormick 205). Attempts at forming a supranational environmental policy have been tripped up by familiar, intergovernmental stumbling blocks.

With the notable exception of the almost fully integrated economic policy, E.U. policies tend toward an intergovernmental approach. Foreign policy is almost entirely intergovernmental, while a whole range of other policies may pursue a supranational approach only to find themselves impeded by intergovernmental disagreement. Movement in the direction of supranational policy is apparent (and almost fully realized in the economic arena), yet the E.U. today remains largely characterized by intergovernmental policy outcomes.

Normative Analysis
I. Arguments for Intergovernmentalism
Despite decades of integration and cooperation, European nations remain quite diverse in terms of culture, language, political ideology, and economic standing. Any attempt at a supranational structure will be forced to overcome these barriers to cohesion.

Years of attempted integration in Europe illustrate the stark differences between the constituent states. The almost constant push and pull between France and Germany, the reticence of Great Britain, and decades of bargaining and compromise demonstrate quite clearly the great disagreement existing in the E.U. on any number of issues. Even minor attempts at integration are often met with stubborn resistance from various quarters. Furthermore, the existing language and culture barriers pose another obstacle to full integration. The Union does manage to function with a number of official languages, but would the average European truly be comfortable with a supranational government full of officials who neither his spoke his language nor fully understood and appreciated his culture? Diverse cultures and ethnicities are difficult to integrate into society, and the scale of diversity on the European continent outstrips that of any existing state. Not to mention that the ethnic and cultural diversity is spread over quite a large area and comprises a huge population (nearly 500 million people), making administration an imposing task for any supranational government. The recent enlargement into Eastern Europe also introduces issues of significant economic inequality among the member-states. Though steps are being taken in the form regional aid and the extension of single European market, the discrepancy still poses serious obstacles to full integration. Saddled by daunting political, ethnic, and economic diversity and an imposingly large area and population to handle, a fully supranational government may not be a feasible goal.

Moreover, many existing institutions of the European Union do not inspire confidence in its ability to function effectively as a fully supranational government. The E.U. suffers from something of a democratic deficit. The only institution to be directly elected by citizens is the European Parliament, perhaps the least powerful of the five major institutions despite recent attempts to increase its influence. The real E.U. decision-makers are largely unaccountable to the general European public. The E.U also lacks anything resembling a coherent foreign policy. It would be foolish and dangerous to pursue supranational governance without first devising a means of ensuring it will produce a coherent, unified, and sensible foreign policy. Lastly, the E.U. has faced criticism on issues of waste and corruption. An expansion into new policy fields and geographic areas would likely only exacerbate any such problems by increasing the size and scope of the government. In its current form, the European Union is likely unfit to manage the entire continent of Europe.

II. Arguments for Supranationalism
As Europe continues to integrate, it is becoming clearer that supranational governance has much to offer to the states of Europe. A unified Europe offers greater relevance in foreign affairs, a more efficient and productive economic system, and a sensible organizational structure for a set of states with some small disputes but, generally, quite similar interests.

Once the focus of the global community, the states of Europe have found themselves the victims of diminishing relevance on the international stage. Shrinking population growth, changing demographics, and a relative weakening of military force have stripped the states of Western Europe of some of their once formidable influence. Though still retaining significant—some would say disproportionate—power in organizations such as the United Nations, states like France and Germany are finding it harder to project their preferences globally, primarily in their relations with the United States. The buildup to the Iraq War paints a picture of European discord and irrelevance. Some states, like Great Britain and Spain, went along with the United States' plan for invasion, while France, Germany and numerous others opposed it vehemently. The disagreement over Iraq in Europe was contentious and hard-fought, yet, in reality, it was meaningless. The United States asked for the support of European states, but ultimately did not need their support in order to go forward. European states may disagree over issues of international import, but in order to maximize their influence over the United States and other world powers, they must form a coherent and unified foreign policy mechanism. Such a mechanism can only be achieved through supranational governance. Without such a development, E.U. member-states will continue to lose global influence.

Nowhere have the benefits of supranational governance been more apparent than in European economic policy. The realization of the single market has been a profound success, breaking down barriers to movement of people and capital, enabling European companies and nations to compete in the global economy, and beginning to correct for the economic inequality of Western and Eastern Europe. The Euro has been successful in the thirteen countries which have adopted it, and expansion into new geographic areas in the coming years seems quite likely. The supranational economic policy of Europe has served to maximize the region's economic potential and unite it like never before. It is a compelling argument for the effectiveness of supranational governance, not only in the economic arena, but as a general tool for the production of prudent policy.

Though not without its fair share of disagreements, the member-states find common ground on many significant issues. In economic policy, free markets, free trade, and fair treatment of workers are priorities across the board. In foreign policy, there is significant disagreement over specific policy, but forming a substantive counterbalance to American power and pursuing effective defense against common security threats are commonly held concerns. On other issues of domestic policy, reduction in carbon emissions, correcting economic imbalance in Europe, and the protection of civil rights represent convergent European interests.

Supranational governance is the pragmatic choice for the European Union. Its structure would allow Europe to most effectively pursue its common policy preferences and would help to re-establish the region as a major player in world affairs. Arguments for intergovernmentalism, on the other hand, often rely on notions of nationalism and xenophobia, or attempt to emphasize the E.U.'s present failings as an institution. Neither type of argumentation truly addresses the functional benefits of supranational governance. Further integration of Europe into a supranational structure is a practical choice and should be pursued vigorously by the European Union.

Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Democratic Inadequacies of the European Union,"Throughout the past sixty years, the European Union has progressed from a trade agreement between several neighboring countries into a supranational and intergovernmental union encompassing nearly all of Europe. As the EU progressed through the integration process, power slowly shifted from the national government level to the European Union. Problems arose when the democratic oversight present on the national level was nowhere to be seen in the EU. What exists now is a multinational organization with enormous power and meager democratic representation. Policymaking, elections, and the distribution of power within the Union all must be reevaluated to meet the Union's mission statement of Listening to its citizens, being accountable to them and working for them in a transparent and decentralized way 1

Lack of Democracy
Abraham Lincoln famously stated, Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people. 2 While there are many interpretations of what democracy means, its core values, a system of government through which the entire population participates, remains constant. The European Union fits these criteria, but only to a certain extent.

Upon careful examination of the EU's institutions and their composition, it is very easy to see how un-democratic the EU currently is. The only institution that is held directly accountable to the European citizens through elections is the European Parliament. The representatives from the other four institutions are selected by their national governments. The representatives for the Council of Ministers, the Commission, and the European Court of Justice are all appointed by their national governments. The other institution, the European Council is accountable to the citizens on a nation-state level; its representatives are the heads of state from each member state. John McCormick defines the EU's democratic deficit as, the gap between the powers of European institutions and the ability of European citizens to influence their work and decisions. 3 This deficit is clearly seen through the citizen's lack of influence over the Commission and Council of Ministers.

As the integration process progressed, national parliaments continued to see their powers transferred to the EU level without the accompanying democratic oversight. These powers, which initially were subjected to democratic controls through elections on the national level, are now held by the Commission or the Council, which have no democratic input. A supranational institution does not have the representation of citizens like a national government or parliament does. The only way for citizens to influence decision-making is through the European parliament.4

A main feature of a democratic system of government is the citizen's ability to change the government through elections or referendum. The majority of the EU is immune to these public pressures because only one of the three institutions handling legislation, the Parliament, answers directly to the European citizens. According to McCormick the average European has few opportunities directly to influence the work of the EU. 5 A major shift in the composition of the Parliament will not necessarily affect the decision making of the EU as a whole. McCormick explains this argument further, Voter interests are directly represented in the European Parliament, but it is one of the weaker European Institutions. The Commission and the Court of Justice promote the interests of 'Europe', but citizens have no direct influence on senior appointments to either body. 6 The Commission and Council could potentially ignore public opinion and continue in a direction they deem worthy. The Commission is supranational and its representatives are not held responsible to the individual states, and the Ministers are only accountable to their individual states, not the EU citizenry as a whole. Two of the three institutions responsible for developing new EU law and policies are not accountable to the European Citizens. Furthermore, when the voters do express their opinions through elections and referenda those opinions can have almost no impact on the direction of the EU.

Democratic Flaws
The parliament is the only institution that answers directly to the European citizens. European wide elections are held over the course of three days every five years to elect the representatives. While the Parliaments power was limited in the early years of the Union, its powers increased significantly with the Maastricht, Amsterdam, and Nice Treaties in an effort to improve the democratic legitimacy of the EU.

The Parliaments powers in the early stages of the union were literally non-existent. Until the debate over the EU's democratic legitimacy began, the Parliaments role was to consult with and deliver an opinion to the Commission and Council of Ministers concerning proposals and legislation. The Commission and Council of Ministers had to consult with the EP when creating legislation, but were not required to adhere to the Parliaments recommendations or opinions. Today, the parliament has the right of co-decision in a wide range of EU legislation. Under this procedure no text can be adopted without the formal agreement of both the Council and Parliament. 7

While the EP wields significant power in the EU, its democratic legitimacy is undermined by institutional loopholes. The first loophole is the policy areas where the Council and Commission do not need to include the EP in the entire decision making process. In some key policy areas, the Parliament cannot change or amend legislation. Instead, the EP only votes to accept or reject legislation, a significant difference in power compared to the co-decision procedure. Some of the key policy areas left out include agriculture policy, taxation, economic policy, citizenship policy, and the revision of treaties. This poses a significant threat to the democracy argument of the EU. By limiting the policy areas where the Parliament shares its legislating power, the EU is also thereby limiting its democratic connection with its citizens. If the parliament does not share equal legislating power with the Council and Commission on every policy area, The Parliament can find itself excluded from critical legislative and policy decisions…European citizens can be affected by measures over which they have no direct control. 8 This weakness almost completely removes the democratic inputs from a portion of the legislation process.

The second loophole is that the EP does not have full legislative powers like traditional national parliaments. The Parliament cannot initiate proposals, they can only debate, discuss and vote on the proposals set forth by the Commission. The EP is unable to complete the entire legislation process of developing, debating, and voting on its own policy proposals. Policy areas that were subject to this complete process at the national level now experience only a portion of this process at the EU because of the separation of powers between the institutions. There is a breakdown of democracy when European citizens cannot communicate their interests and opinions for future legislation to their government. The Commission's representatives, the only people responsible for initiating proposals and legislation, sever all ties with their national government upon taking office and are only accountable to parliamentary oversight.9 It is difficult for public opinion to progress to the EU policy level because the Commissions job is to propose legislation that it feels is beneficial to the EU citizens, considering EU public opinion is not a required part of that process. If the EP had direct initiation power, the citizens could communicate their interests directly through elections.

Electoral and Referendum Flaws
Criticism of the Parliaments elections significantly weakens the EP's case as being the only democratic institution. European citizens view European elections as second –order elections and they traditionally take a back seat to national party politics and elections. This happens because national elections provide a distinct outcome and have the ability to bring about serious change to a nation. Europeans give priority to national elections because,

They determine who controls the national government, which in turn makes decisions that are most immediate and relevant in the lives of citizens…European elections are seen as second-order elections because there is less at stake, there is no potential change of government involved, and most Europeans are badly informed about European issues or know very little about what the Parliament does. 10

This nonchalant attitude EU citizen's hold toward the elections explains a lot about how Europeans feel about the EU. According to McCormick, when the voter turnout in most member states is below fifty percent, it undermines the credibility and political influence of Parliament. 11

Parliamentary elections also face structural problems that weaken their significance. Elections are not conducted on the same day in every member state. Instead, they take place over three-day period throughout Europe. Furthermore, there is no standardized electoral system in the EU. Voters in Germany for example use a different elector system than voters in France. While one country might consider its entire country one large constituency and allow representatives to be elected from a general list of candidates; other member states divide their country up based on population and allow voting based on districts. The EU must standardize its voting procedures to legitimize the EP elections. All of these problems combined with the second-order mentality and low voter turnout dramatically hurt the EP's democratic legitimacy claim.

Election turnout is also likely hurt by EU citizens' belief that their actions do not accomplish anything. Turnout for referenda is on the average higher than EP elections because citizens believe their opinions are truly accomplishing something with a referendum vote.12 If citizens feel they have no influence on their government and believe their opinions are falling onto deaf ears, they will withdrawal from participating. The situation in the EU now is one of an uninformed, unmotivated constituency. The historical use of the referenda provides support for this argument.

A referendum is an aspect of direct democracy that allows the voters to express their opinions on specific policy topics13 through an election. The results of referenda used in the EU are very interesting. In 2001, Swiss voters overwhelmingly decided not to join the EU when the referendum was on the ballot. Also, in 2005 French and Dutch voters effectively ended the attempt to develop a European constitution by voting no when the referenda was on the ballot.

When citizens have the ability to play a direct role in EU decision making and understand the implications of their decisions, voters seem much more willing to participate and take an active role in the EU. European citizens seem willing to participate in EU politics if they know their opinions will be considered, but lack motivation to participate in EP elections because of the small impact they have on the Union.

Voters are so rarely given the opportunity to express their views on EU matters that referenda are often used to express opinions on the EU and European integration more generally, rather than the issue at hand. 14 This quote explains the problems at hand with the referendum process. Allowing citizens to participate directly with referenda allows them to remove all the intermediaries, the undemocratic institutions, from the governing process. This process seems ideal to increase the democratic input of the EU, and to an extent, it does, but its legitimacy suffers because this process only allows EU citizens to participate in the policy areas the EU delineates. One or two referenda every five years does nothing in the way of significantly increasing the democratic input of the European Union; especially when many citizens use those referenda as a means to relay their opinions of EU policy as a whole, rather than the specific issue on the ballot.

Support for Less Democratic Input
Some scholars, most notably Giandomenico Majone, argue that placing more democratic pressures and influences on the EU detracts from its overall purpose. Majone argues that because the EU consists largely of regulatory and economic institutions established to promote free trade and economic development, it should be insulated from democratic influences in much the same way as an independent central bank, like the US Federal Reserve. According to Majone those democratic influences on the EU level can be exploited to serve the interests of politicians at the nation state level, whereby defeating the overall purpose of the EU.15

Insulating the EU from democratic inputs also gives EU political leaders the freedom to make important decisions regarding the future of EU integration and policy. With the general public of Europe withdrawn from EU politics the average citizen does not have an understanding of important integration processes or policy areas. Giving the decision making powers to EU officials, democratically elected or not, who are informed and understand the intricacies of the Union allows them to make better, wiser decisions. While the representatives compromising four of the EU's institutions are not democratically elected, McCormick argues, The citizens hold their national governments accountable, which in turn represent their interests at the European level. 16 It is clear that while the EP is the only EU institution held directly accountable to the European people, the other four institutions are clearly well within the reach and control of Europe's citizens should they need to be reformed.

Moving Forward
The democratic deficit of the EU will only be solved through a major shift in both the structure, and distribution of power in its institutions. The first way to develop more democratic inputs into the EU is to replace the Council of Ministers with a second house of parliament. Using the legislature in the United States as a model, the EU should replace the Council of Ministers with a new institution much like the senate in the US. This new house of parliament would meet separately from the current parliament and would establish a different level of representation.17 Both houses of parliament would share equal power in all policy areas and an agreement from both houses would be necessary for a proposal to become EU law.

In addition to the changes to the Parliament and Council of Ministers, McCormick believes the Commission should be completely taken out of the legislative process. Instead, the powers of the European Commission should be focused on policy implementation…it should have the same role as a conventional bureaucracy, and be charged with ensuring the execution of laws developed by the Parliament. 18 This change in powers would give the Parliament the power to initiate proposals and allow the supranational Commission to focus on making sure the EU develops into a more productive cohesive government. Transferring the initiation power from the Commission to the Parliament allows the citizens to take an active role in electing all representatives responsible for the legislating of the EU.

Another solution that is not as wide sweeping as those previously mentioned would be the expansion of the EP's powers. This issue was already attempted in the failed attempt to ratify the EU constitution in 2004. The constitution would have extended the parliament's co-decision procedure to virtually all policy areas. This change would have established the parliament as an equal legislative partner with the Council on all EU level policy areas.

The EU needs to make a significant effort to involve its citizens in the legislative process. Currently most Europeans do not understand EU level politics or the legislative process. This transparency issue concerning the transfer of information from the EU to its citizens is also one of the reasons for low turnouts at EP elections. Informed constituents, who are passionate, concerned and critical about the decisions their government makes creates a better and more productive government. Opening the Council of Ministers meetings to the public19, creating a formal EU office tasked with improving the flow of information to EU citizens, and establishing a more positive public image of the EU are all possible ways to generate more public interest in the EU.

Reform of the current EP electoral procedure is also necessary to improve the democratic legitimacy. Currently electoral procedures and ballot technicalities are handled on a national state basis. Standardizing all European elections, both EU and member-state, will ensure fair and democratic representation throughout all levels of government. This improved electoral procedure combined with improvement in the transparency of information will promote citizens to take a more serious stance on election turnout..

Conclusion
The last sixty years of the European Union have been filled with integration, economic policy, and the transfer of power from the nation state to the EU. While these advancements increased the power of the EU dramatically, they did little to improve the democratic deficit. The EP is the only institution held directly accountable to the European citizens, but it also has serious democratic flaws. In order to continue the integration process and handle more responsibility, the EU must undergo serious changes to make it more democratic. The institutions, policy areas, distribution of power, and elections must all undergo change to better include the interests and opinions of the EU citizens.",39.39,57.59,27.85,11.87,17882
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,How Much Choice is Too Much?,"Whether it applies to curriculum or vouchers, career paths or college, the vague concept of choice is often invoked as a panacea for the failings of our educational system. One can easily imagine a pontificating College Republican hitting her talking points: Education's purpose should be to provide every student with the opportunity to succeed, she'd bellow, narrowing her eyes. If students do not choose to take advantage of that opportunity, that's their prerogative! Success is a choice each student makes, she'd contend. Thus, failure is a choice as well.

Coming from a liberal perspective, which I am, it is often easy to viscerally dismiss such rhetoric. As sure as Pavlov's dog will salivate at the chime of a bell, the word choice in economic or educational discourse will put a liberal on the defensive.1 Like the buzz-words pro-marriage, death tax, state's rights, etcetera, choice is a tainted euphemism seen only as thinly veiling an evil conservative agenda to write blank checks to corporate overlords and let poor people starve to death. Choice gets at one of the fundamental distinctions between liberals and conservatives: Conservatives tend to view a person's socio-economic position as a result of the choices they have made. Liberals tend to see things like poverty as more systemic problems.2

Obviously, the reality of the situation is not this black-and-white—or blue and red, for that matter. One of the most prevalent current debates within schools and academia is how much curricular choice should be made available to students. I will argue, in classic politician fashion, that the answer is complicated. Choice, in this instance, is a potentially double-edged sword. There are benefits to allowing students to choose their curriculum, certainly—that does not mean, however, that there should be as many available choices as desired tracks. While some choice and tracking is beneficial, all tracks made available to students should be geared toward making that student successful in their lives. Students should not be able to choose a failing track in school, because, as clichéd as it sounds, failure should not be an option that is made available. The purpose of education should never be tracking students into likely poverty.

I have already argued that choice is a notoriously (and often intentionally) obfuscated term, so let me prevent myself from becoming a hypocrite. When discussing how much curricular choice is given to students I am referring to the range of tracks made available to students in a given school, and how much it should be up to students and families (as opposed to advisors, teachers, or testing) to choose individual tracks. In my conception, the amount of choice allowed runs across a spectrum. Neither extreme is especially ideal. Instead, I will argue that the most beneficial system falls somewhere in the middle. The question I will seek to answer is not whether schools should offer curricular choice; rather, to what degree, and in what specific ways should that choice be made available.

For there to be curricular choice, there need to be options available to choose between. Multiple tracks in school, however, is by no means a given as tracking students provides its own whirlwind of debate and controversy. The fact of the matter is that the track a student is placed in correlates with their socio-economic background. Although the reasons for this are most likely multi-fold, the fear is that there is a bias at work. This has been a concern for some time, and not simply about secondary education, but from the earliest onsets. Ray Rist's seminal 1970 article Student Social Class and Teacher Expectations showed biased tracking as early as kindergarten. Rist found that the criteria used by kindergarten teachers to sort students into higher-level reading groups were based on students' display of attributes commonly associated with being necessary for future success. The characteristics of the students who were sorted into the lower reading group included being dirty, smelling of urine, not actively participating in class, speaking in linguistic dialect other than the that spoken by the teacher and students, and coming from poor homes often supported by public welfare. 3 Rist found no statistically significant correlation between tested IQ and the teacher's sorting. The conclusion was that teachers sort students according to their conflation of social class with behavior and aptitude for learning, and that this early sorting creates a fairly inflexible track for these groups beginning at an early age. In a follow-up with the same students in second grade, Rist found little change in the original tracks of these students. He argued that these tracks amounted to caste-like structures based largely on social class as it was supremely difficult for students to move from one track to another year to year. Historically, the same phenomenon has been seen in secondary education. In her book Keeping Track Jeannie Oakes describes how tracking in secondary education has helped perpetuate the established social order. Tracks correlated with socio-economic class, and students generally had little to no say in which track they were placed in.

We must be careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Tracks certainly have their problems. But we must ask whether separate tracks are inherently undesirable, or simply correlation between higher quality tracks and socio-economic status. If tracking is bad, de-tracking is not necessarily better. James Rosenbaum, a one-time advocate of de-tracking, followed the disastrous results of one high school's attempt to de-track its students. In Rosenbaum's words, de-tracking,

transformed teaching from difficult to impossible. It transformed the ideal of equal instruction for all into practices offering less instruction for all. It transformed faster students from motivated allies to disengaged threats. And it transformed teachers from de-tracking enthusiasts into advocates for a return to tracking. 4

Most people would agree that the ideal educational system would properly educate everyone. The fact of the matter, however, is that there are and always will be differences in ability between students. The solution is not to ignore students' strengths and weaknesses by pooling everyone together. Rather, tracks can be beneficial so long as they separate students according to ability as opposed to socio-economic status.

This is the point in the discussion where our choice advocate would most likely clear her throat.Precisely right, she'd say, cocking an eyebrow. And who knows better what their strengths are than the students themselves? Good point, hypothetical choice-advocate. During the 1990s many argued that exact position. In the preface to the 2005 version of her book, Oakes describes how, the old rigid system of completely separate and explicit academic, general, and vocational programs…has now largely disappeared as a result of the backlash against tracking. In this system's stead, Oakes points out that In almost all schools, choice has become an increasingly salient factor in placing students onto tracks, shifting the responsibility for differentiated opportunities, resources, and expectations from the school to the students. With choice, students in lower-level classes have only themselves to blame.[italics mine]5

The push for curricular choice didn't begin in the 1990s. The current had been strong as early as the 1985 book The Shopping Mall High School. Although they were far from choice advocates, the system the authors of that book describe is the system that many advocate for our secondary schools. Teachers and students would create ostensible contracts for themselves and the amount of work and responsibility in a given track or class is understood beforehand. The lower tracks would often be filled with busy work and designed simply to get students through the required coursework at the high school so they could graduate. The idea is that each student would choose which classes to take and, as Oakes described in the preface of her book, the responsibility would shift from schools to students. Tracks would still exist, but no one could cry foul because students could opt into whichever track they desired.

It is easy to see how one might argue that a pure version of this system could help solve the problems endemic to tracking. If the choice of curriculum is left entirely up to the student, than schools would never even have the opportunity to exert socio-economic biases on the tracking of students. The reasons why this is no panacea, however, is two-fold:

(1) It lowers the bar of what education should be. The Shopping Mall High School describes instances where in exchange for no behavioral problems, a lower-track teacher agreed to assign minimal work. Our advocate might point out that this keeps potential drop-outs in school and off the streets. At least they're going to get a diploma and they're not in jail, she might say. I respond by saying that if we allow students to opt into tracks where the educational value is next to nothing, we will only further weaken the value of the American high school diploma.

(2) Choice does nothing to alleviate the socio-economic achievement gap. The correlation between track and economic class is a symptom of the deeper socio-economic disparity in our society. In a society where socio-economic disparities exist, the public education system can and should be used to help close that gap, rather than maintain or exacerbate it. In a pure choice system, low socio-economic status will still correlate with so many other disadvantages that poor children will probably still disproportionately make up the lower tracks. College educated parents, a two-parent household, encouragement at home, money for private tutoring and extracurricular activities are all variables that correlate with both socio-economic status as well as academic achievement.

All tracks in school should be geared toward successful economic integration of the graduate into society. A graduate of high school should either be qualified to attend some institution of higher learning or able to be employed in a position that will allow the student to support themselves. Thus, while there should still be separate tracks and some freedom to choose between them, there should be core requirements and skills every high school student, regardless of track, should have upon graduation. This would require an exit exam (or something equivalent) that tests these skills. The downside here is that there would be an increase in drop-outs. While this is undesirable, it is necessary if we want a high school diploma to mean anything more than, I was capable of showing up to school enough that I didn't get kicked out.

This being said, we should not abandon curricular choice altogether. Although it would take a sizeable investment, public secondary schools should invest heavily in expanding both the size and the quality of their academic advisory staff. With a small advisor-student ratio, advisors would be able to get to know their students personally, figure out where their individual strengths lay, and nudge them and guide them in the direction that best fits their individual needs. An expansion of advising capabilities and quality should be prioritized with regard to funding over second-order programs like sports and extracurricular activities. While these programs are also beneficial, education should be the priority of our public schools. One-on-one guidance and advising should be an integral component to that education.

Placing the entire burden of curricular choice squarely upon the shoulders of a fourteen-year-old high school freshman is absurd. As a society, we don't trust these kids to drive a car, but we somehow expect them to be able to choose a curriculum that best suits them, and best serves their future. A pure choice system may work if every student had parents who took an active interest in his or her education. Sadly, that will never be the case. Instead of letting these children fend for themselves, it should be a major priority of schools to advise their students in the choices they make, and guide them into appropriate tracks.

We should allow for choice, variety, and a students' ownership over their own education. That being said, these students are only children. One of education's primary roles within our society should be to help guide children into responsible adulthood. But we must remember that there are not responsible adults yet.",0,0,17.38,17.42,12627
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Legal Reasoning in Lawrence and the Prospect of Social Change,"The case of Lawrence v Texas is considered to be a landmark case for gay-rights activists. Decided in 2003, Lawrence was the first Supreme Court case to rule in favor of same-sex rights. Stemming from a 6-3 majority, Justice Kennedy methodically crafted the opinion for the Court. The opinion was surprisingly based on due process and privacy rather than equal protection. This logic confused legal scholars many of whom believed that Lawrence was an obvious equal protection case. The Lawrence opinion was a unique opinion for the Court since it violated many unwritten rules: first, Justice Kennedy described homosexual relationships as being a fundamental right, but he never clearly stated that they were; second, Kennedy never clearly stated which standard of review he had used and consequently allowed lower courts to interpret Lawrence how they please; lastly, the Court legalized a defining act (sodomy) which criminalized a whole class and affected the social perception of homosexuals. These unusual characteristics in Lawrence show that this case was groundbreaking. The language that Kennedy used in the Lawrence majority is probably as important as the case itself. The Lawrence decision was decided correctly; however, the narrow ruling in the case, along with equivocal wording, did not advance gay rights as much as people had hoped.

Lawrence definitively overruled the 1986 case Bowers v Hardwick, in which the Court had found that a Georgia sodomy law concerning homosexual couples did not violate the Constitution. The Lawrence decision was primarily based on the Constitutional rights of privacy rather than homosexual couples being equal to heterosexual couples. The holding was not decided on equal protection grounds because if that were so, then Bowers could not have been explicitly overturned—a major intention for the Lawrence Court. Also, Kennedy ambiguously described the future for social change concerning same-sex marriage. On the one hand, he purposely wrote that this decision was not to rule on same sex-marriage, [Lawrence] does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter (Lawrence 11). On the other hand, he specifically writes that homosexual couples:

…are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government (Lawrence 11).

Since heterosexual couples have the power to marry granted by the state, and if homosexual couples deserve the same respect and dignity from the state, it could be argued that homosexuals should have the ability to marry. Some scholars claim that Kennedy wanted his ruling to be broader, but he would not have kept the majority if his opinion included same-sex marriage rights. As a result, Kennedy vaguely describes the Court's feelings on same-sex marriage, perhaps hoping that lower courts will adopt these rights for homosexuals. After the Lawrence ruling, some lower Courts have followed Kennedy's wishes and others have not. Since Kennedy wrote a vague, narrow ruling, lower courts have interpreted this opinion in different ways. The holding permits homosexual adults who, may choose to enter upon this [homosexual] relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives (Lawrence 4) and allows homosexuals to have private consensual sex only when absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects (Lawrence 4) is evident.

Kennedy derives the right to have a homosexual relationship on the bases of privacy and not on the bases of homosexuals being equal to heterosexuals. The Lawrence opinion cites two major Supreme Court decisions, Griswold v Connecticut and Eisenstadt v Baird, as its legal premises, one of the questions on which the Court granted certiorari was whether the Texas statute violated the rights to liberty and privacy  (Franke 1403). Griswold was the first major decision from the Supreme Court concerning privacy. It held that a Connecticut law prohibiting married couples from using contraceptives violated the spouses' right to privacy. Eisenstadt held that unmarried couples had the right to privacy regarding the use of contraceptives. Both of these cases established an unwritten right to privacy that does not explicitly appear in the Constitution. This distinction that Lawrence is ruled on the principle ground of privacy and not equal protection is an important distinction to make because it constricts the holding to affect less social change than most gay-rights activists had hoped.

The language of Lawrence (or lack thereof) provides an interesting analysis of a case that pits future equality against the nation's conservative mentality. The discussion of liberty in Lawrence is completely different than the discussion of liberty in Planned Parenthood v Casey. Also, the lack of a definitive statement for a fundamental right of same-sex couples allows lower courts to interpret the Lawrence decision how they would like to. Kennedy begins Lawrence by saying that, liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places (Lawrence 1). However, in Casey, Kennedy along with O'Connor and Souter (all three were in the majority for both cases) described liberty as a structure of autonomy, at the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State (Lawrence 18). The two different definitions of liberty illustrate the two different states of mind of the Justices. The narrow holding in Lawrence is evident with Columbia Law School Professor Katherine M. Franke, [Kennedy's] reasoning depicts a more confined conception of liberty (1402). Along with the limitations that Kennedy describes about the liberty for same-sex couples, he creates uncertainty by not clearly stating the basis of review that the Court used, one aspect of Lawrence [sic] that was bound to draw criticism and is likely to generate confusion…is the absence of any explicit statement in the majority opinion about the standard of review the Court employed to assess the constitutionality of the law at issue (Tribe 7). This confusion leads to lower courts essentially deciding what standard they want to use and implementing the law using their own interpretation.

The only rights Lawrence provides homosexuals are the protection from the government from intruding in their private lives. The holding states, the Texas statue furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual (Lawrence 11). The state does not have a legitimate interest in prohibiting private, consenting homosexual conduct. The importance of Kennedy's language in the holding implies that he believes the rational-basis test should be used to determine if laws against homosexual relationships further a legitimate state interest. He finds that they do not. Since Lawrence is evaluated with the rational basis test (the lowest level of scrutiny applied by the courts) and not with strict scrutiny (the highest level applied by the courts), Kennedy, by default, determines that Lawrence's rights in question are not fundamental. This being the case, it is easier for future courts to rule that the government only needs to meet the rational basis test in order for their laws to be upheld. This sets up future rulings about homosexual conduct and gay marriage which significantly impact the ability for Lawrence in order to provide a gateway for social change.

Many cases were impacted by Lawrence, but not all of them were impacted in a positive way. In the case Limon v Kansas, Kennedy's intended ruling in Lawrence is (purposefully) misinterpreted. Matthew Limon, an eighteen-year-old man, had been convicted of having oral sex with a fourteen-year-old boy in a school which they both attended. Kansas law punished homosexual sex with a minor more harshly than heterosexual sex with a minor before Lawrence. After the Lawrence ruling, the Supreme Court told the Kansas court to reconsider its decision. But the Kansas court reaffirmed its decision on the premise that Lawrence said, all adults may legally engage in private consensual sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle (Limon 83). Thus, Lawrence had no application to the case since it was not between two adults. Furthermore, the Kansas court noted that preference can be given to heterosexual couples because throughout history, governments have extolled the virtues of procreation as a way to furnish new workers, soldiers, and other useful members of society (Limon 85). The argument that homosexual couples cannot procreate is a tactic which most anti-same-sex marriage supporters use. This argument, albeit a marriage being more than just procreation, is still common and has been found in the courts. As follows, Standhardt v Arizona, a case decided after Lawrence, upholds a law against same-sex marriage. The Arizona Supreme Court held that, the [Lawrence] Court applied without explanation the rational basis test, rather than the strict scrutiny review (Standhardt 4). The Arizona court found that prohibiting same-sex marriage did legitimately protect a state interest. Specifically, the state interest at stake was preserving the connection between marriage and encouraging procreation, an event which is not possible between two members of the same sex. Standhardt also reinforces its ruling by quoting absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects. It therefore follows that the Court did not intend by its comments to address same-sex marriages (Standhardt 4). The Arizona Supreme Court took Kennedy's language in Lawrence to mean that abuse of an institution the law protects means the institution of marriage—arguably the most sacred institution in America. This is proof that Lawrence does not constitute the allowing of same-sex marriage but only the privacy and respect for homosexual acts in the home.

One landmark case that was pro same-sex marriage was Goodridge v Department of Public Health in Massachusetts. Goodridge, argued just months after the Lawrence decision, finally followed Kennedy's intent. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the federal government left the question of whether homosexual couples could marry or not up to the states. And Massachusetts, somewhat mocking the Supreme Court, says the Massachusetts Constitution is, if anything, more protective of individual liberty and equality than the Federal Constitution; it may demand broader protection for fundamental rights; and it is less tolerant of government intrusion into the protected spheres of private life (Goodridge 4). The Massachusetts Supreme Court interpreted Lawrence as an opinion which left the question of same-sex marriage open for the states to decide in favor of, as long as the states respected homosexual couples. Massachusetts granted the ability to marry to homosexual couples because it inferred that being in a homosexual relationship was a fundamental right which the state must protect.

One tool for social change is the dissenting opinion. Justice Stevens' dissent in Bowers was referenced in the majority in Lawrence, and in response to the majority in Lawrence, Justice Scalia writes a scathing dissent. Scalia is concerned that the majority opinion will lead to a legal path for same-sex marriage. Scalia, in his dissent, argues, [Lawrence] dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned (Lawrence 16). The Lawrence decision did not address equal protection for two reasons. First, in order for the Court to overturn Bowers, it had to evaluate Lawrence on the same basis as Bowers was decided. Bowers was not decided on terms of equal protection but rather the legality of the state being able to intrude on a personal and intimate conduct in the home. This is what Lawrence specifically addresses and is thus able to overturn Bowers. Second, if the Court were to evaluate the case on grounds of equal protection, it would allow states to create alternate legislation in order to make sodomy illegal for both same-sex and different-sex partners. This empowerment would create a problem because potentially only same-sex participants would be charged with sodomy. If not evaluated on equal protection, the Court is able to outlaw sodomy laws altogether. This being the case, the Court did not say that same-sex couples are equal to different-sex couples under the constitution. The ruling allows same-sex couples to privately and respectfully engage in sodomy in their home.

Scalia also uses a slippery-slope argument in his dissent to say that Lawrence would require the state to overturn laws against bigamy and polygamy if same-sex marriage were to be legalized. This is a difficult statement to analyze since it is not based on any type of actual law or precedent. Even if a petitioner were to argue that Standhardt was ruled on the basis of same-sex couples being unable to procreate, the petitioner would have a hard time arguing that this is the only basis needed for marriage. In Standhardt, procreation was one of the main reasons Arizona denied the petitioner a right to marry; it was not the only reason. The courts would probably find that there is longstanding history and tradition in the United States of only being married to one person at a given time. In addition to judicial precedent not overturning laws against bigamy, a federal constitutional amendment could, hypothetically, be written to say: Any marriage is legal as long as it is only to one person, same-sex or different-sex, at a given time. This would legalize gay marriage, but also prevent bigamy. Since it is a constitutional amendment it is not up for judicial review and therefore would stand as good law. Without any type of precedent to base this claim, it is extremely difficult to logically conclude what would happen.

The language Kennedy used in Lawrence has the ability to bring about social change.  Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v Hardwick should be and now is overruled (Lawrence 16). These strong words that Justice Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion of Lawrence brought force into the opinion. However, as strong as these words are, in a democracy, the courts are usually not the last judge—the people are. And, after these ardent words by Kennedy, the legislatures created strong backlash in order to please their constituents. Social and political change is difficult to measure from the Lawrence opinion not only because the opinion itself was written just five years ago but also because the gay-rights movement is just becoming a relevant issue in the US. It seems as though Lawrence is only talked about in regards to the ability to marrry even though the opinion is about much more than just a single issue. The opinion as a whole is about a relationship that the government must respect. The legal question of same-sex marriage is left unclear by Kennedy, but he believes Lawrence is about more than just a sexual act. He believes that Lawrence is about protecting an individual choice. The state of marriage legitimizes a private relationship and makes it public. Marriage is a ceremony in a church, in a synagogue, or in a courthouse, that signifies to the public two people making their private relationship public. Kennedy writes, the present case does not involve public conduct…it does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter (Lawrence 11). Clearly, marriage would qualify as being public conduct. Lawrence does not even consider the question of legitimizing a private homosexual relationship and establishing public marriage. It also does not suggest giving a private, consensual homosexual relationship formal recognition. The open-endedness question of same-sex marriage has already created social change in many states—both in the way Kennedy envisioned and also in the complete opposite way.

In Alaska and Hawaii, the high courts in both states ruled that same-sex couples should have the right to marry. After these rulings came out, legislatures responded to their constituents in both states and passed constitutional amendments nullifying the decisions. This type of backlash is not uncommon for an issue that has many negative connotations associated with it since an issue of homosexual rights may elicit passionate opposition because of its relation to deep-seated religious, social, and moral beliefs (Butcher 1426). The impact of social change depends greatly on the political culture of a state. The political culture in Alaska and Hawaii vehemently opposed same-sex marriage, and even though Lawrence provided homosexuals with some rights, it was not enough. But the political culture in Vermont and Massachusetts was more tolerant of gay rights and accepted the decision in Lawrence. The legislatures in Vermont, understanding that gay rights were now expanded under Lawrence, took action to create the nation's first civil union law. And, Massachusetts' Supreme Court ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional in Goodridge.

Some scholars argue that it is conceivable that the Court chose the more limited Due Process Clause to avoid provoking political backlash (Butcher 1428). Lawrence was written to overturn Bowers which was probably the most important part of the case, the Court's decision to…overrule Bowers eliminated what was perhaps the most significant impediment to homosexuals: the criminalization of a definitive behavior of the class (Butcher 1428). The Justices understood that by allowing homosexual conduct to remain illegal, it would only further the problem of integrating a homosexual lifestyle into a normal lifestyle. Whether it be trying to obtain employment, housing, or acceptance into any group, having sodomy laws criminalizes homosexuals and defines them by an illegal act. Justice O'Connor commented in her concurring opinion in Lawrence that brand[ing] all homosexuals as criminals, [sodomy laws] thereby mak[e] it more difficult for homosexuals to be treated in the same manner as everyone else (Lawrence 23). The Supreme Court needed to craft an opinion in Lawrence to try and change the social perception towards homosexuals, and this was what they did.

Because Lawrence is a milestone opinion for a new generation, the influence it will have in the future is difficult to measure. Unlike Brown v Board, which was a milestone decision that ultimately put an end to racial segregation in schools, Lawrence v Texas is a decision that will only begin to end homosexual discrimination. The Supreme Court in Lawrence was not able to terminate discrimination against homosexuals, to allow them to marry in every state, or to create equal opportunities for them when applying for housing. But the Supreme Court was able to overturn hundreds of years of laws that make homosexual conduct a crime and a shame. Future Courts will have greater ability to bring about social change because of to the majority in Lawrence.",24.47,11.74,13.51,13.76,19686
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Living up to Constitutional Standards,"The United States employs a structure of governance that places great emphasis on the separation of powers. Under this model, each branch of authority is separate and distinct from the other, effectively establishing a system of checks and balances. While each of these entities operates in a wildly different fashion, they all share a sense of commonality in that they are bound to uphold the constitution set forth by our founding fathers. This document, which was written over 130 years ago, would ultimately define the true value and meaning of being of an American.

Perhaps the most unique facet of this governmental arrangement, however, is the ability of the lay citizen to influence change. If one disagrees with public policy, they can vote for new representation, or run for office themselves. Often, however, this process can be especially difficult to navigate without the proper resources. Fortunately, the American democratic system offers it's citizenry direct access to the courts. The courts have the ability to serve as an intermediary between the cumbersome legislative process and the public desire to bring about change. The judicial branch of the U.S. government has helped foster many of the greatest societal advancements our nation has even seen, including the desegregation of public schools (Brown v. Board of Education) and the granting of civil liberties to homosexuals. (Texas v. Lawrence) In order to truly understand the far reaching effects the courts have had on society, one can start by tracing the history of prisoners' rights in the U.S. Through examining the eighth amendment and its applicability to the judicial decision handed down in Estelle v. Gamble, the ability of the courts to impact the political process to bring about social change becomes incredibly clear.

In 1798 a series of amendments were introduced to the U.S. Constitution in the 1st Congress by James Madison. Just 12 years after the Constitution itself had been drafted and ratified by the states, the framers realized that some major additions needed to be made. Only ten of the amendments introduced were ultimately ratified and became the Bill of Rights in 1791. These amendments limited the powers of the federal government, and protected the rights of all citizens and residents of America. A certainly powerful set of additions to say the least.

The Eighth Amendment would prove especially important in a criminal justice context as it prohibited excessive bail or fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishment. As with most constitutional language, however, the key terms (excessive, cruel, unusual) were extremely broad spawning differing opinions of there application. Relating the terms to prisoners served to only further complicate the issue. Did the framers intend cruel and unusual to mean anything outside of normal convention? Supreme Court Justice Brennan argued that the following four principles could be used to determine if a particular punishment was cruel and unusual: (Furman v. Georgia)

 1.The essential predicate is that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity, especially torture. 2. A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion. 3. A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society. 4. A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary. 

Justice Brennan would go to argue that court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment should involve a cumulative analysis of the implication of each of the above principles. While this perhaps helped to clarify some of the ambiguity in the original text of the amendment, it certainly did not tie up all of the loose ends. Through examining healthcare in the prison system prior to Estelle v. Gamble, we can begin to get an idea of how the amendment was interpreted and applied by prison officials.

When considering what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, one must go beyond the scope of the generic definition. While most everyone would probably agree that certain practices such as whipping and the deprivation of basic food and nutrition would be fundamentally cruel and unusual, what about the right to healthcare? Under Justice Brennan's principle test it seems to pass without much interference, especially considering over 18,000 Americans (in the free world) die prematurely each year because of their inability to afford health insurance. (Kaiser 1)

According to Jaye Anno, co-founder of the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, prior to Estelle v. Gamble healthcare was considered a privilege, not a right, in a correctional setting. This meant that if you were a sick prisoner, you had to convince a correctional officer of your illness, and if he sympathized with you, he might consider taking you to the nearest hospital. On-site healthcare delivery systems were non-existent, and if you were lucky enough to be taken to a hospital, you'd often be seen by a doctor with significant restrictions on his license because of disciplinary actions pending against him. (Nathan 9) This practice would persist into the early 1970's until a litigant would petition the court questioning the constitutionality of it's application, changing forever the relationship of the eighth amendment and the prison system.

On November 9, 1973, J.W. Gamble (an inmate at the Texas Department of Corrections) suffered a severe back injury while performing a mandatory prison work assignment consisting of unloading cotton bales from a shipping truck. After complaining of immense pain, Gamble was sent to the hospital where he was given medication by an inmate nurse and examined by a doctor. The following day, Dr. Astone diagnosed the injury as a lower back strain and prescribed a pain reliever and muscle relaxant, placing him on cell pass exempting him from regular work assignments. Two weeks later Gamble returned to Dr. Astone stating that his condition had not improved. This prompted Dr. Astone to prescribe a new pain reliever while refusing to reinstate his cell pass privileges, forcing him back to work. The next day Gamble was informed by the prison work coordinator that if he did not return he would placed in administrative segregation for insubordination. Physically unable to perform his work related duties, he refused to return and was consequently placed in segregated housing.

In the following three months Gamble would make 17 different trips to the doctors office while remaining in segregation throughout. On January 31st he was brought before the prison disciplinary committee to address his alleged insubordination. Even after a prison nurse testified on behalf of his condition, the committee decided to place Gamble in solitary confinement. This decision only served to worsen Gamble's condition as he was not permitted to sleep on the special bunk the doctor had assigned, and his pain prescriptions were often lost by staff personnel causing him to needlessly suffer for days at a time.

The climax of this story, however, would occur on February 7th. Throughout the day Gamble was experiencing pain in his chest, arm, and back, while periodically blacking out for extended periods of time. Despite these clear signs of distress and Mr. Gamble's history of medical issues, the guards ignored his plea for help on two consecutive days. Finally, on February 9th , he was granted the right to seek medical treatment, most likely because the guards realized his life could only be sustained through their action. This absolutely appalling turn of events prompted Mr. Gamble to file a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaining of the treatment he received after the injury. Gamble named the Director of the Department of Corrections, the prison warden, and the medical director of the department in his handwritten complaint.

Like most petitioners, Gamble began his quest for justice in the district court. The complaint was quickly dismissed, however, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Instead of throwing in the towel, Gamble decided to try his luck with the Court of Appeals. After review, the appellate court held that the alleged insufficiency of the medical treatment required reinstatement of the complaint. Upon reaffirmation of the claim, Gamble decided to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari, which surprisingly was granted. This meant that the case would be heard before the highest arbiter in all the land, with the possibility of influencing policy throughout the country. The decision of the Supreme Court to take up this case was significant for many reasons. The most outstanding, however, was that the implications of the holding could only be modified through future precedent or legislation, both of which could potentially take decades to develop. Mr. Gamble was seeking retribution for his personal suffering, but would soon discover that his voice would become the agent of change on a level of far greater proportions.

On November 30, 1976 the court came down with a 8-1 ruling in favor of Mr. Gamble. The ultimate victory had been scored, and while the immediate reward was certainly satisfying, the true power of the decision was yet to be felt. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African American to ever serve on the bench. The opinion was clear and to the point; providing healthcare for prisoners was not an issue of privilege, but rather a constitutional right. As Justice Thurgood Stated, The Eighth Amendment embodies broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency. Thus we have held repugnant any punishments which are incompatible with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In other words it was no longer ok to deny someone their right to health just because they were incarcerated. Even though the constitution was written during a time when socialized medicine wasn't available to the elite much less the poor, it must be interpreted in context with the times. If the Justices simply took the words of the constitution at face value alone, our society would be incapable of progressing under such arcane legal doctrine.

While the entire opinion seemed to represent a forceful step in the right direction, one statement in particular appeared to be the spark that would influence the resulting change: These elementary principles (evolving standards of decency) establish the government's obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce physical torture or a lingering death. These words would encapsulate exactly how the court felt about the issue, and seemed to speak directly to prison officials all around the country. Just shy of explicitly demanding for change within the system, it was made clear that the status-quo was not up to constitutional standards. Instead of viewing prisoners as social outcasts not worth protecting , the court seen them as Americans struggling to secure the rights they were owed.

In the concurrence of the opinion, Justice Blackman adds even more fuel to the fire by citing an additional piece of federal law, Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This statute provides that every person who subjects any U.S. citizen to the deprivation of any rights or privileges secured by the Constitution shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law. Just in case you happened to miss the point in the first ten pages of the opinion, this made it clear that anyone who decided not to comply with the requirements set forth was subject to personal prosecution. This included any prison supervisors, wardens, or other administrative staff responsible for ensuring this obligation was met. All of a sudden the burden became much more personal, and if by slight chance you were sleeping under a rock when this decision was rendered, ignorance is never a defense in the eyes of the law.

Even with such a strongly supported opinion, however, there was still one dissenter. While dissenting Justices often disagree with how the law was applied to the facts, this didn't appear to be the case in Estelle v. Gamble. Justice Stevens seemed to be primary consumed by two overarching issues, neither of which applied to the eighth amendment or prisoners rights. His first point of contention was the court's decision to grant certiorari to the case. As he states If the court thought that the case presented an important constitutional question about the State's duty to provide medical care to prisoners, the crude allegations of this complaint do no provide the kind of factual basis the Court normally requires as a predicate for the adjudication of a novel and serious constitutional issue. Justice Stevens seemed to be implying that even if the case was meritorious, this decision should have been made long before it reached the highest court in the country.

Accordingly, his second major concern would stem from the district court's immediate dismissal of the complaint. If the decision of the Fifth Circuit reinstating the complaint had been allowed to stand and the case had run its normal course, the litigation probably would have come to an end without the need for review by this Court. Because the Supreme Court only rules on issue's of law, not fact, both parties of the suit were unable to file discovery motions allowing for access to medical records and other relevant case documents. Interestingly enough, however, Justice Stevens never really flat out disagrees with the actual decision that was rendered. Rather his dissent seemed to primarily serve as a message to the lower court's to take the claims of prisoners a bit more seriously. It is also apparent that he disagrees with the high court's practice of prematurely intervening in suits that could otherwise be more efficiently settled at the appellate level.

One things for sure, when the Supreme Court talks, society listens. The Gamble decision sparked a fury of change in the way healthcare is administered in prisons all around the country, effectively launching a multibillion-dollar industry. In conjunction with the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association established a commission to research healthcare services in the correctional setting. The first prison standards were issued in the same year the Gamble case was decided, with the juvenile system quick to follow suit in 1979. In order to provide an accreditation service for these stringent requirements, the National Commission on Correctional Health was formed to ensure all institutions lived up to the same expectations. Former medical director for the Georgia Department of Corrections and prison healthcare consultant Joseph Paris stated that the Gamble case shook up the national correction establishment. It became quickly apparent that most systems operated well below standards set by the Supreme Court. Litigation became a wave around the country, provoking a massive improvement in prison healthcare. (Paris)

Around the early 90s correctional healthcare had successfully implemented a delivery system that rivaled and in some cases exceeded the coverage of insured Americans. According to Jaye Anno, Physicians now operate under clinical protocols and guidelines comparable to those outside of prisons and are accredited by three national bodies: the National Commission, the American Correctional Association and the Joint Commission. These oversight groups are crucial in ensuring the Gamble decision sustains a lasting legacy. As prisons began to comply with the judgment, a wave of fear was set off amongst all correctional executives around the country, none of which wanted to be the last man standing. This domino effect would ultimately become as important as the original ruling itself.

The Gamble decision also influenced hundreds of derivative claims by other prisoners and advocacy groups around the country. The American Civil Liberties Union sponsored many of these suits, forcing cities and states to spend large amounts of money on litigation, or else fix their healthcare systems. Most chose the latter, with an average annual of cost of about $4,000 per inmate. (Nathan 3) According to Jaye Anno, in 1998 California spent $483 million on prison healthcare for its roughly 157,00 prisoners, totaling about 13% of its corrections budget.

While healthcare within the prison system has dramatically improved, there still exists many inadequacies in need of attention. One particular area of struggle is largely rooted in the domain of infectious diseases. Because inmates live in very confined and often congested quarters, the spread of germs becomes very difficult to manage. Couple this with the fact that many prisoners engage in homosexual activities, and you effectively create a breeding ground capable of supporting the proliferation of many deadly diseases. With the threat of bird flu initiating a global pandemic, we must begin devoting more resources towards making these environments more hospitable.

Another area of concern lies in the treatment of hepatitis C, a potentially life threatening disease that flourishes in prison populations. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that over 18% of inmates are infected, compared with 1.6% of the overall population. Hepatitis C is generally spread by drug use, transfusions, and in rare cases through sex. The disease can cause fatigue, pain and vomiting, and gradually affects the liver often leading to cirrhosis and cancer. The problem in prisons is that no universal policy exists regarding when treatment should be administered. This leads to institutions taking wildly different measures in response to prisoners infected with the disease. Pennsylvania, for example, tested all 37,000 of their inmates in order to ensure treatment programs began immediately for all those who were infected. New Jersey on the other hand, refuses to test inmates until they exhibit symptoms of liver disease, which many inmate advocates and physicians argue is far too late.(Detroit News) Using the Gamble decision as reference one would tend to believe New Jersey is certainly walking a fine line, if not crossing it. Hopefully through future litigation a universal policy mandating immediate treatment by all facilities will be established.

Roughly 30 yeas ago, G.W. Gamble sat in his cell suffering because of the State's total disregard for inmate healthcare. As a prisoner with little financial support, his options were quite limited. Instead of simply accepting the system for what it was, however, he decided to invoke his constitutional right and challenge a practice he felt was explicitly barred by the eighth amendment. After drafting the handwritten compliant and filing suit accordingly, the district court slammed the door in his face. Instead of becoming discouraged and submitting to their dismissal, he forged forward and petitioned the court of appeals. Gamble's decision to appeal the matter would represent the beginning of a long journey, ultimately ending with a reward far greater then he ever imagined. Estelle v. Gamble symbolizes the model by which an ordinary citizen can influence the political process to bring about social change. This decision opened the eyes of legislatures all around the country, spawning statues further protecting the rights of the incarcerated American. Gamble will forever remain the sole reason prisoners enjoy access to healthcare, while serving to further remind every American that the courts represent a major catalyst of change, and must be exploited accordingly.",70.97,81.7,43.08,30.54,19834
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,German Surrender of Autonomy to Fascism,"National Socialism in Germany is often viewed as a unique phenomenon as a result of the global extent to which the NAZI regime exercised expansion and extermination. However, the groundwork for this seemingly specific example of fascism contains the same defining characteristics as other examples of fascism throughout Europe. A strong nationalistic foundation in Germany provided Germans a strong sense of unity as well as the incentive to preserve their nation against foreign and internal enemies. The role of nationalism as an atypical component to National German Socialism allowed Adolf Hitler to gain authoritarian power from German citizens both legally and willingly. Fears of enemies created in the nationalist rhetoric of German ascendancy, led many Germans to surrender their political power in order to uphold the stability of the nation.

It would not have been feasible for the NAZI Party to implement the extreme measures taken over the course of the 1930s and 1940s without adulating the long established conviction of German superiority. The ability to achieve the goals of Lebensraum or the extermination of the Jews rested solely on the capability of the NAZI party to convince everyday Germans that the nation which united them was unique, superior, and just in their actions. The underlying belief that Germans were different even in their criterion in determining members of the nation is seen in Edgar Jung's prose. “The nation in the Western sense is a mass of people formed into a State, and not the organism of a people bound by destiny and blood: the individual is seen as not being born into such an organism but into the state.1 Jung's comments demonstrate the sense that Germany's view of national identity is based on higher standards. While Western nationality is defined as simply an assemblage of individuals living in the same area, a German's identity is not determined on the exterior place of birth. It is viewed as one's destiny to be a member of the German nation; it is the interior, the blood, which is the real definition of German.

The Nazi Party consistently capitalized on the passionate national sentiment of German supremacy. Theodor Fritsch describes what was at stake if those undermining the wellbeing of the nation were left to their whims. It had come in accordance with unmistakable psychological laws- just as surely as a house must collapse if no one stops those who are undermining its foundations. 2 This quote clearly states that the preservation of the nation is a priority of the Germans and anyone who is not a member of the nation will certainly have reason to disturb the foundation.

By reaffirming the distinction between Germans and Non-Germans in a biological sense, the Nazi's were able to demonstrate on an ever increasing radical plain that these differences were not only real, but needed to be eliminated. Daniel Jonah Goldhagen in Hitler's Willing Executioners shows that one of the basic roles of the Concentration Camps was the creation of an environment which blatantly reaffirmed superiority of Germans over Jews. The third central feature of the camp system was its transformation of the victims to conform to the Nazi image of them 3 Such horrific conditions made it impossible for Germans to consider themselves even within the same species as the emaciated, shaven, and downtrodden, concentration camp victim. Goldhagen also states that the severity of the actions performed at the Concentration Camps were justifiable by the underlying national belief in racial superiority. In this new world-governed by the Nazi German morality of pitilessness in the application of violence to ""subhumans"" – Nazi German man and Nazi German woman could treat non- Germans as they saw fit. 4 Thus the concentration camp also served the role as an outlet in which Germans could exercise the authority which accompanied racial dominance.

If the foundation of German fascism was nationalism, then the establishment of enemies during the Weimar Republic was the fuel that allowed National German Socialism to gain precedence and continue running. With the end of World War I German soldiers and conservatives began to search for those who were to blame for the embarrassing defeat. The creation of the stab-in-the-back theory emerged as the belief that the German public, most notably Jews and Communists, had failed in their patriotic efforts to support the war.5 Conservative Germans legitimate belief that Germany had been winning the war when they were forced to surrender is evident in Dietrich Orlow's History of Modern Germany. Forgetting that the OHL had acknowledged military defeat and forced Germany to peace negotiations, the Conservatives and their allies suddenly recalled that Germany's armies had been ""victorious"" until they were ""stabbed in the back"" by the Revolution of 1918. 6 Not only did the Conservatives assert that these groups were to blame for the loss of the war, they were also beneficiaries of the new Weimar Republic as well as the Treaty of Versailles.

The genuine shock expressed by the German nation at the terms of the Versailles Treaty allowed the Conservatives to push their message that the Jews were not simply enemies of the German nation but were ultimately November Criminals. Cassels discusses how perpetuating the belief that the Jews were enemies of the nation was simplified by the abundant Jewish leadership which existed in the Social Democratic Party. In this conspiratorial perspective special opprobrium was visited on the left -wing Jewish intelligentsia. Much of the Social Democratic leadership in November 1918 was indeed Jewish, and this fact played its part in the application of the epithet “November Criminals. 7 The Social Democrats were alone in carrying the burden of signing a treaty associated with the belittlement of Germany.

Throughout the Weimar Republic the fear of Communists not only led to the creation of a new enemy against the state, but paved the way for the abdication of freedom to authority. The desire for stability appears to prevail over democracy in the National Assembly as a direct response to the threat of Communists.

But the National Assembly went beyond this and wrote Article 48 into the constitution. This gave the president the right to declare an emergency and govern the Reich or a Land for a limited time without parliamentary approval. The delegates to the national assembly had the ""Spartacus Week"" upheavals of 1918-1919 in mind when they included article 48 in the constitution… 8

The legislation which results out of the fear of a communist enemy becomes the primary means by which Adolf Hitler assumes power in 1933. Following the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire, Hitler was able to effectively use the Communists once again as a harbinger of chaos.9 Through the use of Article 48, he legally obtained the most severe public abdication of freedom by establishing a dictatorship. While the legislation allowed Hitler to assume such a level of power without public consent, the role of Communist fears had a significant impact in the lack of public outcry against the decision.

The extent to which the Social Democrats of the Weimar Republic favored stability over democracy is most evident in their dealings with paramilitary organizations following the war. The slippery slope of abdication to authority seems to begin with the Ebert-Groener pact which allowed the military freedom to deal with the Communists as they pleased, to a hands-off approach to organizations such as the Freikorps.

The rampant patriotism of the Freikorps was appealing to Conservative Germans, but their adamant opposition to Bolshevism was enticing to the Social Democrats as well. Cassels comments on how even the Allies of World War I were unable to see a reason to abolish such an organization due to its anti communist ways. The freikorps was super patriotic and violently anti-Bolshevik, and for the latter characteristic they were tolerated by both the Allies and the German government. 10 This approach to the friekorps truly demonstrates the genuine fear of Bolshevism during this period, especially if this fear was powerful enough to convince victims of past German aggression to allow such a potential threat to persist.

The combination of a need for stability along with anxiety of enemies perpetuated into 1930s Germany allowed Hitler's violent actions to persist without mass hostility. The ability of Hitler to execute the Night of Long Knives in 1934 without a massive outcry becomes understandable in the context of the political environment of 1920s Germany.11 For fourteen years Germans lived with a government that allowed essentially free reign for military organizations to deal with the Communist enemy. While the execution of an unknown number of paramilitaries at the hands of another organization was newsworthy, the existence of the Sturmabteilung and the Schutzstaffel was nothing out of the ordinary. The ability of members of Naitonal Socialism to commit atrocities and gain dictorial power arrise within an environment in which it is understood that stability can justify the means.

The phenomenon of the National Socialist German Worker's Party comes to fruition through a culmination of specific events throughout German history, but ultimately its foundation is composed of the same features as other fascist movements. A robust sense of nationalism, the existence of enemies which threaten the stability of the nation, and a desire to abdicate freedom for the protection of the nation are simple criteria for an all encompassing description of fascism. However, this framework is capable of explicitly recounting the story of the National Socialist German Worker's movement in the twentieth century.",0,0,0,3.71,9788
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Role of Party Identification in Voting Behavior: Is There Room for Issue and Candidate Evaluation?,"Noted American political scientist V. O. Key, Jr. once stated, The voice of the people is but an echo. The output of an echo chamber bears an inevitable and invariable relation to the input (Page 1978, 3). This political analogy lends itself poignantly to the conceptualization of voting behavior in the United States encompassing the ideas that are central to the debate around the import of party identification compared with that of issues and candidate traits in regards to vote choice. In a representative democracy, the vote is not a modest part of the people's voice; it is in fact fundamental for political participation. The vote is thus an echo. As Key points out in the quote above, it is important to consider the input as well as the mechanism that together produce the echo in order to understand the people's voice. Voting choices are a product of both personal attitudes and social contexts, of a personal and a social calculus (Beck et al. 2002, 57). A step removed from the actual importance of elements determining voting comportment, this relationship frames the debate around voting behavior.

In the literature reacting to the principal concepts drawn out in Campbell et al.'s The American Voter there are many references to voters' issue preferences and candidate traits as being important determining factors of one's voting behavior. Even with this seemingly opposing tone, there still exists among dissenters a widespread acknowledgement of the existence of the effect political party identification has on vote choice, albeit to varying extents. Indeed, until the apparition of this sort of debate in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the so-called ""Michigan Model,"" with its emphasis on the fundamental importance of long-standing partisan loyalties, dominated the subsequent decade of academic research on voting behavior (Bartels 2000, 36), making addressing the model in ulterior research practically incontrovertible. Since then some scholars have reinterpreted the role of party identification in vote choice, while others have downplayed its importance and nuanced its predictive power based on a triad of factors as explanations of vote choice: party identification, issue perceptions, and candidate evaluations (Whiteley 1988, 961). The former group of scholars tends to have the aim of strengthening the conventional wisdom; the latter group is of course of particular interest in the analysis of the role of issue voting and candidate traits in the electoral function. In looking at the current literature on the topic, it is evident that studies on issues and candidate traits have been successful to a certain extent in checking the power of party identification and have been helpful in identifying social and personal circumstances in which these additional factors are important. However, party identification prevails as a more convincing and more important vote predictor.

In order to evaluate the current state of literature on voting in terms of political issues and candidate traits, it is necessary to discuss original works that relate the additional factors to the conventional wisdom as well as some of the problems that arise in these revisions. John E. Jackson in his 1975 article takes an idealistic approach to the voting process that includes party identification as an endogenous factor in the voting process that is required by the democratic model. Contrary to convention, he claims that party identifications result from the issue evaluations of the two parties as well as from individual social experiences (162). It is then also a choice and is a part of the electoral process. The notion that partisanship is born within the voting process is crucial to Jackson's argument because it effectively downplays the importance of partisanship. In fact, the statistical model developed in the article demonstrates that Party affiliations, issue positions, and evaluations are simultaneously related to each other (1975, 171), suggesting an interdependency of party identification and other factors.

Furthermore, Jackson emphasizes a sequential process of voting of which the issues are central. The first proposition that people's positions on the important public issues relate to their social, economic, and geographic situations (1975, 162) provides the circumstances that in turn affect policy preferences. Next, according to the model, these issue positions determine people's evaluations of the competing parties, from which party identification is derived. Finally, the vote choice is related to candidate evaluation.

This sequence of social context, issue evaluation, then vote choice is founded on two assumptions which seem logically misguiding. The first, and most important to Jackson's argument, is the endogenous nature of party identification. This assumes that the first level in the sequence (social, economic, and geographic situations) has a negligible effect on party identification. Any substantial effect would logically undermine Jackson's direction and order of causality in issue evaluation and in perceived distance between the voter's evaluation and the candidate's stand. In fact, Campbell et al. circumscribe party identification to the individual's affective orientation to an important group object in his environment (1960, 121). Therefore, partisanship could be a cumulative tally of affective evaluations which have their own dynamic separate from issue evaluations (Whiteley 1988, 965). Affective evaluations are dependent on one's environment but devoid of issue content. If party identification is in fact exogenous or predetermined, then it cannot be an integral part of the voting process.

Secondly, it is founded on the assumption of a certain level of sophistication and political constraint on the part of the respondents. This assumption creates some methodological problems because the data is taken from the University of Michigan Survey Research Center's study of the 1964 presidential race between Johnson and Goldwater. The historical context for this contest provided voters with unusually clear party lines especially on easy issues such as black civil rights. Question of this nature are of course included in Jackson's analysis of evaluation of important issues. Insurgent candidates, like Goldwater, offer relatively distinct choices on the issues, so that more people vote on policy grounds even if their capacity to do so remains constant (Page 1978, 103). Respondents were able thus to move through Jackson's voting process with greater ease to candidate evaluation. The particularity of the data leads to the bloated conclusion that Voting decisions are largely motivated by evaluations of where the parties are located on different issues relative to the persons' stated positions and to a much lesser extent by party identifications unless people are indifferent between the parties on the issues (Jackson 1975, 183). The last part in this conclusion leaves the issue-causal model open to criticism on the basis of voters' political awareness, their intensity on the issues, and the utility of their being interested. Here, exogenous party identification completely divorced from the issues would play a determining role. In this case, it is reasonable to infer that changes in party attachments, in the short run, derive primarily from affective feelings rather than from cognitive judgments about issues (Whiteley 1988, 981).

The strongest point of argument in Jackson' s analysis has to do with the fluidity of party identification, especially on the short-term. Larry M. Bartels takes into account the short-term factor and highlights its viability:

While the traditional Michigan party identification questions are clearly intended to tap long-term partisan affiliations rather than short-term vote intentions, voters who support a party's candidate or candidates may claim a more general identification with that party, without having anything like the psychological attachment posited by the authors of The American Voter.(2000, 46)

That the Michigan Model hinges on the long-term stability of party identification provides an explicitly political basis for partisanship, and it also accounts for the short-term changes in partisanship (Whiteley 1988, 965). The political basis for partisanship then lends itself to the support of the endogeneity of party affiliation in the voting function and, consequently, the role of party identification is diminished to one of the interdependent factors of issue evaluation. However, as Whiteley points out, the stability of partisanship is largely irrelevant to the question of whether or not it has a causal influence on voting behavior (1988, 965). Briefly stated, this is because the instability can be explained by processes other than issue evaluation. In his article, Bartels launches a test of panel data over three presidential elections that hypothesizes:

If expressions of party loyalty in the heat of a presidential campaign are significantly contaminated by short-term candidate evaluations or vote intentions, we should observe much weaker relationships between partisanship and voting behavior when partisanship is measured well before the campaign has even begun.(2000, 47)

The results of the test show evidence for a lag effect of partisanship and provide no evidence that the apparent rebound in the electoral significance of partisanship is an artifact of increasing susceptibility of short-term considerations (2000, 48). This test has serious implications for the assumed endogenous nature of party identification since it removes a critical component of Jackson's issue and candidate evaluation that leads to vote choice.

The third in the triad of factors to be considered in this essay, candidate traits, has thus far been grouped into issue evaluation. Nonetheless, most scholarly works on the subject treat candidate traits as a part of candidate evaluation. This is a logical assertion because in relation to the vote only those traits which are evaluated by the voter matter. Furthermore, this is not necessarily part of issue evaluation. For the sake of the Jackson model candidate traits are best defined as candidates' particular stances on political issues, since they are a part of an endogenous issue-causal model determining vote choice. This implies that candidate evaluation is centered around the issues.

However, some literature introduces a new dimension of candidate evaluation based on a psychological perception of personality traits of the candidates. Psychological candidate evaluation effectively removes political content from the process at the same time removing candidate evaluation from the endogenous whole of the voting function. This means that judgments about candidates make an independent contribution to determining the vote apart from issue perceptions (Whiteley 1988, 966). However, facing weak data on its effects, one may well run the risk of inferring a spurious correlation between psychological evaluation of candidates' personality traits and voting behavior. Moreover, this psychological assessment admittedly accounts for a minor part of overall voting behavior (Miller et al. 1986). Thus in relation to the predictive power of party identification for vote choice, psychological evaluation of candidate personality traits is far less important. The circumstances in which these perceptions may be important is when analyzing it based on impression retained about the candidates that stem from an assessment of political messages. In these circumstances, candidate evaluation is akin to Lodge et al.'s online model of evaluation, which relates political matters to the final candidate evaluation. With this model, evaluation of political messages can go under the guise of psychological assessment of candidates' personalities since the rationale behind the evaluation is forgotten.

Since national survey data measures more straightforwardly perceptions on issues, party identification, and the distance between them, it is more pertinent to analyze candidate traits on the basis of one's evaluation of the candidates. As done above, it is most interesting to then interpret candidate evaluation in terms of the issues at stake to determine how it pits against party identification and whether it is important to the vote choice.

The debate is thus restructured to center itself back on the impact of issues on the vote. The arguments above try to nuance party identification into a set of cognitive democratic decisions, but do not take out party identification, as it is difficult to do, to test the extent to which people vote on issues. As Page indicates, on the whole this is because of methodological difficulties since It is no easy matter to sort out what affects what, among policy preferences, perceptions of candidates' stands, and evaluations of candidates (1978, 102). The plethora of variables and the unclear direction of causality make the analysis of issue voting a difficult endeavor.

V. O. Key argues that voters could discern party differences on the issues if the parties states clear positions (1966). The current literature on the subject of issue voting heads in this direction. Beck et al. take into consideration the transmission of political information in a social context to demonstrate that citizens are embedded in social contexts that join with personal traits in shaping their voting decisions (2002, 57). This examination eliminates much of the confusion created by methodological difficulties of determining the degree to which people employ issue voting and holds constant the import of personal attitudes. Through a manner of reversed deduction that alleviates some of the pressure on the citizen under Jackson's model to correctly evaluate issues, this shows the importance of issue evaluation to the vote choice. Furthermore, it includes the rationalist theories of voter utility recognizing that the willingness to undertake a comprehensive search [for political information] is limited by the high costs (Beck et al. 2002, 57).

The results of Beck et al.'s investigation of the role of social intermediaries in contemporary presidential voting are two-fold (Beck et al. 2002, 68). Firstly, the social context, in particular personal networks and groups, proves to be a substantial source for party cues. If these cues have bearing on the vote choice, then this has specific implications to the conventional wisdom in regards to the interpretation of party identification, which holds that party identification is a result of pre-adult and pre-politically consciousness socialization. Secondly, Beck et al. find that partisan cues have a direct influence on voting behavior (2002, 68). Thus, the social context sets up an evaluation of political messages that affects the vote choice. Conventional wisdom would have it that this issue evaluation has little effect on partisanship, the best predictor of voting behavior. Beck et al. do not argue otherwise but instead put these fixed personal characteristics in a dichotomy with social context. The duality of personal attitudes, of which Beck et al. say party identification is a part, and social contexts form voting decisions. This implies that party identification plays a secondary role. Unlike in Jackson's model, however, this social calculus allows for an independent and exogenous function of party identification.

In order to fully discuss the importance of factors other than party identification in regards to vote choice, it is meaningful to look at the evolution of the role of party identification itself. If conventional wisdom holds true and party identification remains the most important determinant of voting behavior, then there is little room left to argue that issues and candidate traits are more important factors. Some scholars have investigated the presence and supposed volatility of partisanship and have come up with reinterpretations of it in light of new political contexts. They have generally found that their interpretations of party identification continue to have strong influences in voting behavior, oftentimes increasing its importance.

Specifically, Bartels examines the distribution of partisanship particularly in response to the noted increase in the number of independents and the corresponding decrease in the number of people who identify themselves with the Democratic or Republican parties. This evidence in favor of the thesis of partisan decline has the implication that the electorate may become increasingly more independent or non-identifying as older voters who are more partisan pass away (Bartels 2000, 36). However, Bartels makes the distinction that Declining partisanship among non-voters may leave the distribution of party identification in the voting booth unchanged (2000, 37). Indeed, in every presidential contest since 1952, voting partisan identifiers have out numbered non-voting ones, the latter experiencing a marked downward trend compared to the former. This is an important distinction when relating partisanship to voting behavior and this reinterpretation comes to strengthen the conventional position. The conclusion is that the public has slipped into an era of increasingly vibrant partisanship (Bartels 2002, 44). However, one weakness of this model is one of the explanations as to why it reaches this conclusion: One plausible hypothesis is that… [it] represents a response at a mass level to increasing partisanship at the elite level (Bartels 2000, 44). This begs the question of where the elite level cues are coming from and whether Beck et al.'s social context, as discussed above, does not put it into check.

Responding to the analysis of the distribution of party identification, Miller's study assesses its volatility in relation to short-term forces. The results demonstrate that across regions and party affiliation, with the exception of the 1964 and 1972 presidential contests, there has been no across-time decrease in the extent to which the national presidential vote is a party vote (Miller 1991, 565). This conclusion certainly leaves little room for issue voting.

Party identification accounts for a great deal of the logic that determine voting behavior. Since the conception of the relationship between party identificaion and the vote, several scholarly works have attempted to downplay its importance as a predictor. In order to investigate the importance of issue and candidate evaluation in the vote, party identification is included in the triad of determining factors. The most persuasive point of argument in the revisionist theories include the social context of issue and candidate evaluation that lead to vote choice. Other theories reinterpret the role of party identification to find that it is just as important as before and often strengthened. Overall, party identification remains the most powerful determinant in voting behavior, but social context remains the key element with which one can discuss the opposing end of the spectrum.",0,0,0,0,19088
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Theories of Legal Constraint,"There are three major theories, legal constraint, sincere preferences and strategic decision-making, which attempt to explain how to empirically analyze the judicial body of the Supreme Court and its decision-making process. These theories present themselves as being in direct conflict with each other in their beliefs of exactly what constrains the judiciary in their decision making process. While each theory does offer it's own unique perspective on judicial interpretation and has it's own particular caveats, the theories are not actually fundamentally in conflict with each other. Rather the legal constraint theory generally proves more applicable to situations confined completely within the authority of the Court where as the other two theories work better when the Court relies on other actors to enforce its rulings. Furthermore, the sincere preference theory can at times intertwine itself with the legal constraint theory, and at other times it can fit perfectly within the strategic decision-making theory. Therefore instead of being three theories that are completely in conflict with one another, they are three theories that could potentially be applicable to the same judge on the Supreme Court, even with different decisions on the same case.

The first theory of judicial decision-making is the theory of legal constraint. This is the broadest theory which also might be the most difficult to empirically analyze. This theory rests on the idea that the federal courts were designed to be independent and thus we should not be surprised that they are capable of actually being independent, 1 Segal continues to describe that the legal discretion that exists in the type of cases that reaches the Court combines with institutional incentives that favor independence to produce a Court that is capable of acting like 'single minded seekers of legal policy', 2 Therefore, according to advocates of the constraint theory, the judiciary really is independent, and therefore each judge is able to chose the way in which he will interpret the Constitution, determined by the particular nature of their office and the decisions they make, without serious consideration of how any outside actors will respond.

One difficulty that arises with this particular theory of judicial analysis is the determination of what exactly is the correct perception of legal constraint, and how one can measure whether the particular proclaimed legal constraint is being adhered to. Jeffrey Segal and Harold Spaeth examine the use of precedence and the affect that this particular legal constraint has on Supreme Court justices. They come to the conclusion that by and large, most justices do not adhere to precedent in a truly meaningful way. They are willing to acknowledge though, as Justice William Rehnquist also says that though some precedents are more appropriately disregarded than others, 3 there are times when Justices do adhere to precedence. Justice Rehnquist states in the case of Payne v. Tennessee that considerations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved, 3.

Justice Rehnquist feels more comfortable applying the precedent line of legal constraint to matters more concerned with statute-based concerns. There are also at least two Justices, Stewart and Powell who display adherence to precedent, while most other Justices are supportive of their preferences at a minimum rate of at least 80%, 4. Therefore many Justices use precedent sometimes, a few Justices almost all the time, and some hardly ever. This illustrates that the type of legalistic constraint a Justice uses, as well as how and when they choose to apply that legal constraint, depends very much on how the Justice views their role and their responsibilities in the Judiciary and the government at large. When Justices are making decisions that are not in fact constrained by outside factors, they are able to apply a set of interpretive canons, a set of principles that guide them in interpreting the Constitution, statutes, precedent, and derive an outcome 5. For some of these Justice's their interpretive canon is strict adherence to precedent. For some Justices it is adherence to an originalist mode of interpretation. Other Judges might strictly follow Ely's doctrine of interpretation. The singular term legal constraint could potentially apply to an infinite number of legally constraining ideologies chosen by the Justices. The Justices are in fact completely at leisure to choose the ideology that they are going to utilize, and the legal theory of constraint works best, as long as they are making decisions based on interpretations that are not going to rely on other major actors in the government for enforcement. If this happens to be the case, then the legal theory of constraint is not as applicable, since the Justices must consider first and foremost actors' responses outside of the Court, and another theory is deferred to. Therefore in order for the legal theory to have its full force, it can only really be used in matters that don't involve other major actors as enforcers of the decisions, such as with procedural and evidentiary matters whose execution the Court presides completely over, or matters that are more statutory in nature, such as those involving property or contract rights.

The next theory of constraint is the sincere preferences theory. The sincere preferences theory claims that the Court's does it decisionmaking by policy-motivated, politically sensitive judges who are constrained by democratic forces, 6. A Justice would simply cast their vote in a way that would yield the policy they desire most, but this is not a problem because of several mechanisms that keep them from running a muck and being an all mighty council that just makes decisions according to their whims. Peretti claims that the appointment process that Justices go through is an integral part of their connection to democracy, and that by voting her values, the policy-motivated justice is carrying out the value premises of her appointment, premises actively and deliberately selected by elected officials-the president and the senate, 7. Therefore a Justice proudly proclaiming that they will be politically motivated on the Court and making it clear to those in the President and Senate how they are politically leaning will legitimate the use of personal preferences on the Court by letting it be checked be democratically elected actors. The Judiciary as a redundant policy making institution can expand the number and diversity of opportunities for groups to advance their interests and contest policies that they believe will harm their interests, 8, and thus provide another meaningful actor in our pluralistic system. This is because the Court's value lies in its capacity to give another chance to legislative losers and thereby to promote a broader consensus and system stability, 9. Because it is a reactive institution, in theory it should be offering a different type of forum to citizens where they can directly bring up grievances with legislation that might have had unforeseen individual consequences, or that is just plain unconstitutional.

There are some potential problems with the Democratic checks that Peretti proposes. For example potential Justices being interviewed for a position on the Court often completely evade the questions being asked of them by the Senate and President, in order to try and deny any sort of suggestion that they might be making decisions based on their personal policy preferences. So there would have to be a cultural shift that resulted in an acceptance in the politically motivated Justice that would make this a truly meaningful constraint. There's also the problem with the Court being a truly open forum for anyone who has grievances. It is often argued that it is only those with money, political influence or an inordinate amounts of media coverage that ultimately will get their cases hard by the Supreme Court the fastest, or at all. Therefore there is the potential for the Court to be an extremely valuable redundant institution if equal access is a reality, but if it's too swayed by wealth or notoriety then it will end up being very similar to the legislature.

This theory could actually potentially intertwine at times with the legal constraint theory if the Judge happens to choose the legalistic canon of interpretation that is the most likely to yield his own personal policy preferences. For example a more conservative Justice who genuinely wants to see more conservative outcomes and policies will be more likely to choose a more conservative canon for interpreting the Constitution, like an Originalist line of thought. When one thinks about the Justices that have sat on the Supreme Court, it is more often than not the case that a liberal Justice happens to proclaim and defend a more liberal cannon of interpretation while the more conservative Justices devote themselves to conservative cannons. Because American society at present is not very accepting of the idea of a blatantly political Justice, regardless of whether Justices are in fact making policy based decisions, it seems as if the legal constraint method is a way for a Justice to show that they aren't making decisions in a capricious manner but instead according to a defined cannon, while at the same time that cannon is most likely very instep with the Justices personal preferences.

It can actually be seen through the controversial case of Bush v. Gore (2000), that when the legal cannons that each justice normally adhered to did not produce the policy choice they desired, the justices were willing to completely change the legal cannons they used to interpret the Constitution in order to get the candidate they desired into office. This instance suggests that the cannons that the justices chose to interpret the constitution by and large generally reflect their sincere policy choices, and when they do not reflect them, if they care about the policy outcome enough, they are willing to compromise adherence to their usual mode of legal constraint in order to produce their sincere policy preference; in this case getting the candidate they desire into office.

As opposed to the legal theory of constraint which is best adhered to most completely when the Supreme Court is only making decisions encapsulated within the sphere of the law, the strategic decision making theory is best applied to all situations that require the aid or enforcement of another political body in order to make the decision of the Court effective. This idea makes most sense in light of the fact that the founders of the U.S. not only desired the Court to be an independent body, but also a body subject to the system of checks and balances that they were crafting. As Knight and Epstein say, judicial supremacy in the United States is not a formal provision established by intentional design. It is rather an informal norm, like many political institutions, that achieves its force to structure constitutional politics primarily through the willingness of political actors to continue to submit to its proscriptions, 10. Therefore as the strategic theory goes, the judiciary when making their decisions must keep in mind how willing political actors are to submit to the decisions they make, or else they could lose their legitimacy as an authoritative institution. It follows then that if justices wish to see their policy preferences etched into law…then they must make calculations about their political clout relative to that of the other institutions, 11. This idea fits in particularly well with Rosenberg's ideas about how the Court is constrained by three major factors, they must convince courts that the rights they are asserting are required by constitutional or statutory language…courts are wary of stepping too far out of the political mainstream and since the judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse…but merely judgment…litigants are faced with the task of implementing the decisions, 12. It is almost impossible to think that the Court can make decisions that require outside actors cooperation without considering how constrained by those outside actors they are in regards to the particular issue they're deciding on.

The personal preference theory, and thus at times potentially the legal theory of constraint, easily fall within the confines of the strategic theory. If a Justice truly wants to generate their personal policy preferences from a decision, if they are acting during a period of increased judicial restraint where the federal government isn't necessarily willing to put their full support behind the decision of the judiciary, or the public is not accepting of the Court's decision, they will want to reflect on what will truly generate their policy preferences within this system of constraint. Justices are not only constrained by their own professed legal cannons, their own policy preferences or the democratic constraints that Peretti speaks of; rather they are also constrained by the realities of how other political actors and citizens will enforce and respond to their rulings. Therefore a justice who desires their true policy choice might potentially strategically alter his ruling so that maybe even though the outcome of the case is not the way they would have wanted it most, the policy that forms as a result is more inline with what the justice desired.

Though the three different theories of empirical analyzing of judicial decision making are presented by their proponents as being completely in opposition with each other, there are actually many ways in which the theories can be intertwined and overlap. There are certain times when certain situations lend themselves better to one of the theories over another, for instance it's generally more appropriate to use a strict legally constrained approach when the justices don't have to rely on any actors outside of the Court itself, but the personal preferences within the strategic constraint theory when dealing with other agents. The strategic constraint model actually would not even make sense in proceedings that were completely contained within the judiciary, because there would not be a need to take into consideration what other actors would do, because there wouldn't be other actors. Therefore the legal constraint model can potentially overlap with the sincere preferences model, and then if there are other actors involved, the sincere preference model is very much intertwined (and thus potentially the legal constraint model) with the strategic decision making theory.",0,0,0,3.48,14741
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Transitional Justice?: The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Socio-economic Rights,"Reconciliation means that those who have been on the underside of history must see that there is a qualitative difference between repression and freedom. And for them, freedom translates into having a supply of clean water, having electricity on tap; being able to live in a decent home and have a good job; to be able to send your children to school and to have accessible health care. I mean, what's the point of having made this transition if the quality of life of these people is not enhanced and improved? If not, the vote is useless. 1 –Desmond Tutu, Chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission

The transition from the apartheid government to a fully functioning democracy in South Africa is often lauded as a prime example for other countries to follow. And for many reasons it should be. The actual transition of power was practically bloodless, the implementation of the new constitution went smoothly and civil and political rights continue to be observed throughout the country. According to the Human Rights Watch 2008 Country Summary, the government generally respects the rights of individuals to vote and upholds numerous civil freedoms including freedom of speech and the press.2 The government also created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to deal with past gross violations of human rights and foster forgiveness throughout the shattered country, instead of choosing to ignore the human rights violations of the apartheid regime completely. On the surface, South Africa appears to embody a governmental transition done right.

Institutionalized Inequalities
However, the South African transition did not come close to accomplishing everything promised to the people, especially in regard to social and economic rights. While these rights are enshrined in the 1996 Bill of Rights alongside civil and political rights, the Human Rights Watch Country Summary displays the extent to which social and economic rights are consistently violated. The Bill of Rights promises universal education, however at least 50% of students attend schools that lack basic necessities such as electricity or proper sanitation facilities, not to mention are taught by under qualified teachers with few materials. Health care, especially considering the high percentage of individuals living with HIV/AIDS, is severely lacking. Many South Africans live in shacks or have no home at all while others are continually evicted from their homes as corporations buy up open land. This endemic poverty is overwhelmingly located in rural areas, a fact that can be traced back to the apartheid regime's policies to keep blacks from owning property inside certain city boundaries. Human Rights Watch notes a priority concern in South Africa is to ensure that the government continues to address the progressive realization of socioeconomic rights and to hold the government accountable to fulfill these rights as binding obligations rather than programmatic aspirations. 3 In the report, HRW also suggests that South Africa ratify the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights as a sign of their commitment to the implementation of these rights.

Even more noteworthy, and perhaps revealing, is the severe inequality that plagues the country. According to the UN Human Development Index, which uses life expectancy, education, literacy, standard of living and GDP to measure the general well being of a country, South Africa is classified as an upper-middle income nation.4 This ranking seems to indicate that in South Africa the resources exist to eradicate the violation of many economic and social rights, however there is a basic implementation problem. The root of this problem could be traced to the transition from the apartheid regime to the democratic government and the party receiving power, the African National Congress's (ANC), failure to create the economic reform necessary to ensure basic human rights. The continual violation of social and economic rights in South Africa displays the failure of the transitional government to address the economic oppression institutionalized by the apartheid regime. The focus on civil and political rights during the transition, while at times necessary, obscured the real problem in South Africa: institutionalized economic oppression. This can be seen clearly in one of the institutions created to aid the transition: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In this paper, I will argue the flaws of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are indicative of the larger problems that the transitional government failed, or did not want to, address- namely ensuring the implementation of economic and social rights in South Africa. The legacies of allowing political factors to largely influence the way in which the TRC functioned are seen in the inequities in South African society in 2008.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Mixed Legacies?
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), constitutionally mandated by the 1995 Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation act, attempted to use the revelation of truth about the injustices that occurred during the apartheid regime in order to promote national healing.5 Beginning in 1996,it functioned under the belief that the best way to heal past wounds from apartheid was uncovering truth about wrongs inflicted against other citizens. The committee consisted of three bodies: the Human Rights Violations Committee, which investigated apartheid-era human rights violations, the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, which worked to restore victim's dignity and the Amnesty Committee, which had the power to grant amnesty to perpetrators (black or white) based upon full disclosure of actions and proof of political purposes. The effectiveness of the TRC is highly debated by both citizens and scholars. While it did reveal the truth about many of the disappearances and murders which had plagued individual families, few high-ranking apartheid era officials applied for amnesty and the court of South Africa has failed to prosecute those that did not apply, effectively delegitimizing the work of the court. However, more importantly, most agree that the commission failed to address the violations of social and economic rights perpetrated by the apartheid regime, opting to focus mainly on more visual violations of civil and political rights. But what are the actual reasons for this failure and how has it affected the future of socio-economic rights in South Africa?

Who is to be blamed?
Kadar Asmal, Minister of Education in South Africa, argues the TRC had the legislative scope to deal with violations of social and economic rights committed during the regime and, at times, attempted to exercise it. However, the commission proved hesitant to venture beyond traditional civil and political rights offenses and media coverage, focused disproportionately on the dramatic evil deeds done by those who sought amnesty from criminal prosecution. 6 Asmal believes the transitional justice instituted by the TRC focused too much on the individual instead of societal healing and group culpability. Nicoli Nattrass highlights the fact the TRC had a set of institutional hearings that investigated business, the health sector, gender issues and churches and their role in upholding the apartheid regime. These special investigations and hearings were created to, explore broader issues of involvement and moral responsibility. 7 Similarly to Asmal, Nattrass argues the TRC failed to sufficiently explore the role of whole sectors of the economy, instead opting to focus on the more sensational individualized amnesty hearings. Both authors, essentially, focus on the individuality of the proceedings in the TRC, claiming they would have been more effective in addressing social and economic rights had there been more discussion of broader societal ramifications. They blame the TRC as an institution for its inability to expose social and economic violations, not the legislation which created it or the political scene that bore it.

Asmal and Nattrass make valid criticisms of the TRC. It did focus too much on the experience of the individual, instead of the shock of an entire society, and the media played a large role in deciding which of the hearings received attention. Asmal acknowledges that, in a system that killed far more infants through malnutrition and unavailability of water than it killed adults with bullets and bombs, the drama to be had from placing militarists on trial might easily overshadow the equally real atrocity of the system itself. 8 Asmal and Nattrass believe the commission could have delved beyond the realm of civil and political rights, but simply chose not to. However, the interest the outgoing apartheid regime had in blocking a full investigation into the violations of socio-economic rights seems to point to a deeper issue than simply the TRC's choice to only thoroughly investigate civil and political rights. As displayed by the research of Elizabeth Stanley and Naomi Klein, the failures of the TRC were attributable, instead, to the political forces that surrounded the creation of the new government, not lack of will or action on the part of the commission.

The Politics of Truth Commissions
First and foremost, the TRC, as constructed by the transitional government, lacked a real forum in which to openly discuss the violations of socio-economic rights committed daily by the apartheid regime. Both the Amnesty Committee and the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee dealt mainly with truth telling about gross violations of human rights such as torture, kidnapping and mass murder.9 Victims or families of victims were given a cathartic forum to discuss emotions and try to understand the actions of the apartheid regime. This forum allowed for the acknowledgement of their pain as well as the violation of their human dignity. Both Committees focused on acts taken by individuals, not policies representative of the entire regime. However, the lasting legacies of apartheid are seen much more clearly in the rampant poverty and economic oppression that plagues the country, not the horrific and sensational individual rights violations that occurred. In the TRC, no committee is dedicated solely to exploring, acknowledging the injustices of everyday life under apartheid or allowing the economically oppressed to speak out. The outgoing National Party helped to construct a commission that focused on the evils of the individuals who applied for amnesty instead of the entire regime. These individuals could be made into radicals or deviants from party line. Or those who stood before the amnesty committee could claim they were simply acting upon orders from those higher up, reminiscent of the excuses of Nazi's used during the Nuremberg trials. The National Party ensured the construction of a truth commission that only revealed partial truths about the regime in order to maintain the legitimacy necessary to continue to hold some political power. The lack of a forum for the discussion of socio-economic rights violations reflects this need to reveal only partial truths.

The TRC's inability to address violations of social and economic rights also stems from the economic interests of the National Party. As discussed by Naomi Klein in The Shock Doctrine, during the transition the National Party attempted to maintain influence in any way possible. When it became clear they would be put out of the majority in the South African Parliament, the National Party turned to economic negotiations in order to maintain the wealth its white members had amassed throughout the regime.10 They successfully implemented their own economic plan, under the noses of African National Congress leaders, who were naturally preoccupied with winning the battle to control Parliament. In the process, the ANC failed to protect itself against a far more insidious strategy- in essence, an elaborate insurance plan against the economic clauses in the Freedom Charter ever becoming law in South Africa. 11 The National Party's economic plan established a free and independent central bank, protected private property against land reform and redistribution, and limited actions the government could take in order to lower unemployment or socialize health care.

The National Party had an interest in creating a commission that would not delve too deeply into their own socio-economic violations of human rights because this commission would then have the power to make recommendations in order to create a more equitable society. In essence, the TRC would have the mandate to recognize, and perhaps correct, the rights violations the new economic negotiations would perpetuate from the old regime. As Beetham points out, there is a general agreement among commentators on economic and social rights that for them to be effectively realized would require a redistribution of power and resources, both within countries and between them. It is hardly surprising that many governments should be less than enthusiastic about such an agenda. 12 The last thing the National Party wanted was a redistribution of economic power. So instead, the transitional government created a commission that dealt with the, outward manifestations of apartheid such as torture… [leaving] the economic system served by those abuses completely untouched. 13 Maintaining the oppressive economic institutions of the apartheid regime proved particularly easy in South Africa because the old beneficiaries of the apartheid regime maintained some measure of control and influence in the government.14 The economic interests of the National Party are implicit in the TRC's failure to address socio-economic human rights violations.

However, the National Party could not, on its own, have dictated the entire mandate for the TRC. During the consolidation of economic power by the National Party, the incoming African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela, focused on maintaining political power and upholding the delicate agreement that allowed for the government transition. During the creation and implementation of the TRC, the ANC wanted to keep the peaceful nature of politics and maintain the status quo instead of rocking the boat by investigating the National Party's attempt to avoid dealing with the institutionalized economic violations of rights found during apartheid. Instead of challenging the former apartheid regime, the ANC settled for individualized trails in order to avoid further social fragmentation.15 By choosing to uphold the status quo, neither the TRC nor the government… sufficiently challenge[d] the structural inequalities which contextualized apartheid inequalities. 16 Without being able to challenge these inequalities, the TRC proved only able to hold the economic regime of apartheid minimally responsible. The TRC suggested a wealth tax of 1% for all businesses, regardless of their relations with the regime. However, the limited acknowledgement of structural and institutional problems by the TRC contributed directly to its inability to make the necessary suggestions in order to address these issues.17 Overall, the ANC's insistence on maintaining the status quo and acceptance of the interests of the National Party in the TRC lead to a commission that failed to truly acknowledge the abuses of social and economic rights during the apartheid regime.

Conclusions: How can Socio-economic rights be ensured in South Africa?
The TRC failed to acknowledge that the revelation of truth about gross human rights abuses and small reparations do not provide justice for the socio-economically unequal past in South Africa and the ramifications of this omission still resonate in society today. Sadly, for those who bore the brunt of the brutality of the apartheid regime, life has not changed significantly. Today, the country stands as a living testament to what happens when economic reform is severed from political transformation. Politically, its people have the right to vote, civil liberties and majority rule. Yet economically, South Africa has surpassed Brazil as the most unequal society in the world. 18 Obviously, democracy and the existence civil liberties have not been a sufficient condition for securing economic and social rights. The transitional government allowed political and economic pressures from the National Party to play too large of a role in the commission established to investigate their own human rights abuses.

So what can South Africa do now? As HRW mentioned in its country report, signing the UN Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural rights would be a step in the right direction. Most, of the socio-economic rights mentioned in the Covenant are also already in the constitution, so it is up to the ANC to enforce them. A redistribution of resources and economic reform will be necessary to ensure socio-economic rights for all. This movement will only come from massive grassroots pressure and social unrest, as the transition from apartheid to democracy came. South Africa has the constitutional framework to ensure socio-economic rights for all- but does it have the political will to enforce it?",64.49,35.78,48.31,18.46,17237
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Countermajoritarian Myth,"Countermajoritarianism, depending on who you ask, is either the justification for judical supremacy or its disease. Detractors of the Supreme Court can hardly comprehend how a body with such apparently little democratic legitimacy can wield such power in the American political system. Granting coequal status to the electorally unaccountable judicial branch, these critics argue, most certainly runs afoul of the principles of a government President Lincoln famously summarized as being of the people, by the people, for the people. Yet to its supporters, the Judiciary's independence from elective politics is exactly what necessitates its existence. Without a powerful Court, proponents argue, the rights of minorities will be sacrificed at the altar of popular sovreignty. To them it is the words of another former president that define our government, to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men. 1

Not surprisingly, the authority of the Court becomes interposed between what Michael Klarman calls the heroic countermajoritarian function, that is, the common wisdom that a fundamental purpose of judicial review is to protect minority rights from majoritarian overreach and a countermajoritarian dilemma, which he defines as the notion that invalidation of statutes by an unelected, remotely accountable federal judiciary is inconsistent with basic premises of democratic government. 2 These two contravening principles seem to dead end us at a choice between tyranny of the majority or reign of the robe. Thankfully this is not the case. Countermajoritarian arguments on both sides of the issue, intuitively, presuppose that the Court is an obstacle to the popular will. Klarman and his forerunner Robert Dahl, however, undertake studies that expose the myth of a Court disengaged from national sentiment. And while both pieces were largely intended as oppositional works to the substantive claims of the heroic countermajoritarian function, taken together with the political studies of Keith Whittington and Lawrence Baum they construct an entirely new insight into the Court's value. What emerges is a picture that should please those who honor both majoritarian principles and a commitment to basic liberties. The Supreme Court, contrary to ideologically fueled perceptions, is an agent of the People and is legitimized as such through a variety of institutional and political constraints. In this capacity it respects the popular will and best serves it by universalizing National Ideals when other political actors cannot or will not.

The first part of this paper intends to establish the legitimacy of the Court's ability to represent the People by highlighting its democratic foundations. It assumes acceptance of the fundamental concept that in a democracy elected representatives do, by and large, represent the prevailing attitudes of the electorate.

Certain institutional and political constraints exist that prevent the Court from pursuing a course radically out of step with general preference. One such constraint is the Judiciary's dependence on other political actors for legitimacy. As the American concept of judicial review is not enshrined in the text of the Constitution but rather justified by the Court's own pronouncements in Marbury v. Madison, it is the purest bootstrapping, explains Keith Whittington, to imagine [Marbury] establishes judicial supremacy as a political practice. 3 For the Court's adverse possession of Constitutional review to persist, it must rely on the continued abidance of the executive and legislature. At historical junctures when the Court has been seen to veer off course from acceptable adjuication, it has encountered resistance—notably in the forms of powerful Presidents like Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt who have tried to undermine the Court's monopoly on Constitutional authority. Additionally constraining is the Court's inability to enforce its own decisions. The judicial branch, after all, possesses neither the power of the purse nor of the sword. The Court itself acknowledges its dependency, conceding in Cooper v. Aaron (unanimously) that Compliance with decisions of this Court, as the constitutional organ of the supreme Law of the Land, has often, throughout our history, depended on active support by [other] authoritites. Withholding that support, the Court confesses, precludes the maintenance of our federal system of legitimized Judicial supremacy.4 Thus, lest it bite the hand that feeds it, the Court's ability to adjudicate independently of the popular will is severely constrained by the relative fragility of its authoritative mandate.

Desires to advance strong countermajoritarian programs are largely checked by institutional constraints. Yet, the Constitutional appointment process, and particularly its usage of late, makes it unlikely that a majority of the Court's membership would hold views demonstrably out of step with popular will in the first place. Justices are, after all, nominated by the democratically elected President before they are subjected to a confirmation hearing by the electorally accountable Senate. Robert Dahl's experience monitoring the selection procedure led him to point out the obvious reality that Presidents are not famous for appointing justices hostile to their own views on public policy nor could they expect to secure confirmation of a man whose stance on key questions was flagrantly at odds with that of the dominant majority in the Senate. 5

In the intervening fifty years since Dahl observed the democratic demands of the confirmation process, political scrutiny of would be Justices has only increased. Lawrence Baum argues that, in fact, we have entered an entirely new era of intensified examination of judicial nominees, focused on strict expectations of ideological congruence and ajudicative qualifications. Indeed, while the half-century preceding Dahl's article saw three of thirty-six Presidential Supreme Court nominations fail to obtain Senate confirmation, seven out of twenty-seven nominations have fallen short since.6 19 The hearings have evolved to meet the Senate's own assumption of greater investigative responsibility. They continue to increase in length and now presuppose the relatively recent practice of interrogating an appointee on his or her jurisprudence. Consequently, in the current era, Braun concludes, the eagerness of many senators to oppose nominees whose views they dislike give presidents an incentive to choose people who seem ideologically moderate and who have avoided controversial positions on policy issues. 7 Thus, it is unlikely an individual whose policy preferences are out of touch with the majority would ever be appointed, not to mention confirmed. Ultimately, challenges to the majoritarian foundations of the Court must consider this dynamic role that the recognizably democratic branches play in determining its membership.

Political constraints upon the Court's composition and jurisdictional latitude have translated into a judicial renderings that accord with national sentiment. While the High Court commands the authority of Congressional review, it reserves its exercise for extreme circumstances. In one hundred and sixty-seven years of Supreme Court existence leading up to Dahl's case study only twenty-four pieces of federal legislation were deemed by the Court impermissible within the first two years of enactment. The Court's caution in striking down legislative agendas immediately means the presumable legal manifestations of the People's will remain safeguarded. Similarly, withholding invalidation with the two-year election cycle reflects a deference to constituents and their opportunity to react at the polls. Just as the Court has shown itself to be largely unwilling to defy Congressional action in the short term, it has even more rarely impeded sustained legislative efforts throughout the long term. Only six times, in Dahl's history, has the Court remained recalcitrant to continued Congressional attempts at passing specific reform. These figures lead Dahl to the conclusion that The elaborate 'democratic' rationalizations of the Court's defenders and the hostility of its 'democratic' critics are largely irrelevant, for lawmaking majorities generally have had their way. 8

Up to this point an effort has been made to establish the Supreme Court as rooted within a sufficient democratic framework upon which, assuming fundamental principles of democratic representation are accepted, the Court may act as a proxy for the general public. Now that the Court's democratic credentials have been propounded, it is appropriate to show the judiciary's utility to the body politic whose interests it seeks to defend. The primary benefit the Supreme Court provides in its fiduciary duty to the People is the universalization of communal principles. This paper makes the normative claim that protection of national doctrine, and not deference to state and local autonomy, offers the most utility to the People. The Civil War marked the high point of debates over federalism and ultimately settled the question in favor of preservation of national principle. The Reconstruction Amendments, particularly the Fourteenth, established that state sovereignty is and should be constrained by a binding conception of American liberty.

When other governing authorities fail to ensure that nationally recognized substantive protections are extended throughout the land, the Supreme Court is in the unique position to act on behalf of the principled majority. If the Court rarely challenges federal legislation, which is after all presumptively usually in accord with that principled majority, it has shown an exceeding willingness to intervene in State action. Michael Klarman highlights the landmark case and cause celebre of rights foundationalists Griswold v. Connecticut as evidence of what he perceives as an overblown perception of the Court as a gallant defender of minority rights. Klarman reminds readers that when Justice Douglas issued his famous opinion invalidating a Connecticut statute banning the use of birth control by married couples, only two states still had such laws on the books. This is hardly the heroic countermajoritarian role claimed for judicial review by proponents, he argues. Furthermore, Griswold, Klarman charges, evidences the broader truth that the court identifies and protects minority rights only when a majority or near majority of the community has come to deem those rights worthy of protection. 9

To the countermajoritarian ideologues who Klarman is addressing this might be a sad reality, yet the Court's flair for enshrining commonly acknowledged liberty has intrinsic value to those Americans who share a faith in democratic principles and a commitment to rights protection. If one abandons positive or negative expectations of countermajoritarianism and instead accepts Thomas Grey's definition of the Court as the expounder of basic national ideals…even when the content of these ideals is not expressed as a matter of positive law, than Griswold was a remarkable success.10 The 1965 ruling was a famous example of a common Court practice in which, in Klarman's words, it takes a strong national consensus and imposes it on…outliers. 11 Impelling obstinate authorities to abandon their out of touch ways is an important means of protecting popular aspirations and the Court has embraced this function with considerable success. Indeed it is in this capacity that Dahl, who was unimpressed by the Court's fitness to stand up to Congress, appreciates the judiciary's mandate. The Court, he writes, is most effective when it sets the bounds of policy for officials, agencies, state governments or even regions. 12

The Court is particularly effective in isolating and smoking out forces of reaction largely because other political actors neglect to do so. Gideon v. Wainright, like Griswold, is another celebrated instance when the Court formalized a right, which the nation had considered a norm. Had Clarence Earl Gideon been tried in one of forty-five other states, he would have been provided a lawyer.13 Yet Florida remained a Constitutional holdout until the Court's intercession. Because Florida's failure to protect Gideon's right to counsel was so anomalous, Klarman remains unmoved by the Court's intervention. Congress, rationalizes Klarman, can force local outliers to abide by national norms as well as the Court can. 14 Klarman is absolutely correct that Congress possesses the same legitimate authority as the Court to change the law. Yet the distinctiveness of Florida's statute, or lack thereof, is both an indicator of its egregiousness and of the unlikelihood of Congress to act. Congress, whose activities are largely strategic because of its highly political nature, would find little incentive to mobilize in an effort to change a local law. Even if Congress did overcome initial reluctance to intervene in State matters, the cause of indigent criminals would surely not generate the requisite political capital Congress to come to their aid. In Congress, the need for prioritization is felt in the area of constitutional disputes as much as it is in routine policy disputes, Whittingotn explains, debates over abortion euthanasia, and religious liberty may readily rise to the top of the political agenda and demand attention from political leaders, whereas the requirements of a criminal defendant's right to counsel or police interrogation techniques will never receive full political consideration. 15

Of course the ultimate evidence of the Court's powerful ability to enshrine national principles in the face of inactive political actors is Brown v. Board of Education. Polls have shown that before the Court's decision a majority of the American public favored integration and after the decision a majority of the American public supported the Court's rendering.16 And, indeed, Topkea, Kansas was no outlier. Yet as Ronald Dworkin points out, even if the only people who wanted de jure segregation were white Southerners…the fact remains that the national Congress had not in fact checked segregation, either because it believed it did not have the legal power to do so or because it not want to. 17 The likely explanation is that the white Southen faction, despite it being a minority, was so powerful in the government that it prevented the subject from ever being broached. Indeed, while the elected legislature most often represents the majoritarian will, legislative leaders, explains Whittington, must cope with fractious coalitions and crowded agendas that often paralyze Congress from acting in that will.18 Judicial independence from electoral politics frees the Court to act in exactly these situations.

Klarman charges that a decision of Brown's physical scope is the exception, rather than the rule and that Country was on its way to destroying Jim Crow organically anyway. The Court's modesty in wielding this judicial power in expanse, reveals a deference to the elected bodies that is admirable. Indeed, the Court is only willing to interpose itself when it is necessary and this should provide comfort to those who remain fearful of a judicial tyranny. That national trends were setting wheels in motion against segregation only highlights the urgency of the Congressional paralysis and the Court's agency of the populace. Furthermore, acknowledging the relative infrequency of cases of Brown's expanse, which also include the likes of Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas, ought not undermine their importance. They remain evidentiary of flaws in traditional democratic institutions that can, at times, leave them too self-constrained to advance majoritarian demands and reveal the ability of the Court to fill the void. That the Court has shown a readiness but not an overzeal to issue these decisions is a reminder both of its commitment to the People and their principles as well as the judicary's ability to serve them within a democratic framework.",0,0,0,0,16062
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Analysis of British Rule of India,"As Nehru claims, two versions of English rule emerged in both Great Britain and India. The intellectually developed England grew in tandem with the savage and feudalistic England. The British justified the harsh treatment of Indians and the lower classes of Great Britain with the British notion of intellectual and cultural superiority and the supposition that British rule alone would lift the less developed cultures up to the level of the British. While in Great Britain brutality was restricted to criminals and the lower classes, in India the brutality was widespread reaching all but the privileged few. The brutal treatment of Indians manifested itself through an education system that promised equal education but not equal opportunity, through the overreaction of the military and military personnel, and through the callousness of British leaders towards the Indian population.

British re-education of Indians acted as a double-edged sword; on the one hand, Indians were allowed to enter British public schools and Universities opening Indian minds to a wealth of knowledge previously unknown to Indian civilization. Yet, the new British education debased the cultural heritage of Indian civilization. Education of the upper castes of Indian society promoted the British ideal of facilitating the intellectual development of less developed civilizations. Yet, this ideal was shown to be another way to subtly exercise power over Indian society. The subtle British dominance through education is shown in Thomas Macaulay's philosophy to create a class of interpreters between the British and Indian masses.1 Thomas Macaulay's idea was not to create a class of Indian intelligentsia equal to the British, but a class of people who served as a medium. These so called Macaulay's Children could be better educated, have all the tastes of the British elite and yet still be denied access to the upper echelons of government and society open to the British in India. A clear example of this inequality is illustrated in the movie Gandhi. Although Gandhi is by all means a well-educated and upper-class citizen, he is forcibly removed from the first class section of the South African train.2 While this event occurs in South Africa, the fact remains that Gandhi is not considered an upper-class citizen in the British Empire based on the sheer fact that he is Indian. The unequal treatment of the Indian elite compared to the British elite psychologically demoralized the Indian people by creating a ceiling on upward class mobility. This barrier stopped assimilation between the British and Indian cultures keeping the distinction between conqueror and conquered throughout the British rule of India.

Not only were the Indian elite psychologically damaged by the education system, but the Indian masses were hurt by the British education system further demonstrating the cruel nature of British rule masked by the social good of public education. When the British conquered India, Indian history was rewritten transforming India's literary and technological achievements into nothing more than folklore and stolen ideas from more civilized cultures. Images of savagery and mysticism marred the historical accounts of Indian civilization. Government schools were erected in every district with a curriculum taught in English where Indian history was rewritten to depict the past as an era of superstition and backwardness.3 With a skewed version of Indian history, those previously uneducated had only the British to believe. Intentionally or not, the British deepened the rift between the British and Indian creating in a feeling of inferiority in the Indian masses. The feeling of inferiority of the masses was much more powerful than the barrier faced by the Indian elite in such that the elite had the knowledge to question British superiority whereas the masses did not have such knowledge.

The reaction of the British military toward Indian resistance to British rule moves the British rule from a psychological to physical brutality. Throughout the history of British India several notable resistances against British authority emerged. Even more notable is the reaction of the British military to these demonstrations. The first uprising occurred in Northern India in 1857. The great Indian Mutiny and Civil Rebellion of 1857 came as a shock that was to reverberate through all the relations of the British Indian Empire for the next ninety years. 4 The British army quelled the uprising with brute force, but knew the status quo of authority could not sustain British rule in a foreign land. The British sought to strengthen the rule of India by letting the crown assume authority of India and reorganizing the military for more control. The reaction of the British to the 1857 Revolt can be seen as a logical reaction to Indian uprising if the British intended on keeping authority in India.

Later reactions of the British military to peaceable Indian revolts and non-cooperation demonstrate the true brutality of the British military. Both the Amritsar massacre and the brutal beatings against those marching on the British salt factory illustrate the British military's overreaction to civil protest and the horrifying nature of the brutality of the military's actions. The Amritsar massacre at Jallianwala Bagh occurred when the British Indian Army opened fire on thousands of innocent unarmed civilians with no escape save for the lone entrance guarded by the army. In no way was this demonstration violent or even hinting at violence through inciting speech. As the enlightened society that England claimed to be, a more diplomatic approach should have been taken not a violent response to fire at protesters. Unnecessary violence should only exist in more primitive societies and if England embraced the ideals of political revolution the military should have allowed the protest. The inhumanity of General Dyer's action towards a crowd of non-violent protesters is sickening. When asked why he had acted in such a way he responded that he wanted to create an example for the Indian people that resistance to British rule was unacceptable.5 According to his argument, brutality was justified by the superiority of British rule. As a representative of the British rule, he exemplified the idea that the British rule was savage and unenlightened despite its civilized front.

The second non-violent action of Indian protesters and the harsh reaction of the military occurred when a group of Indians marched towards the British salt factory. In this example, a group of Indians marched towards an army armed with nightsticks and ready to beat anyone who came too close. The march resulted in countless non-violent Indians being beaten one after another by the British Indian Army with no retaliation on the part of the Indians.6 Because of the callousness of the British Army and its extreme overreaction, this event evoked a response worldwide creating sympathy for the Indian independence movement. Throughout the period of imperial rule by the British, the army grew in its savagery and baseness in an attempt to suppress and ever growing movement towards independence. With the growing brutality of the army, British rule took on the role of savage conqueror and suppressor of a nation of people.

Finally, the callousness of British leadership in India created an image of England as a backward society exerting feudalistic control over another nation. The type of person who came to India to rule over the conquered territory consisted of people who ascribed to the liberal philosophy, who were looking for fortune, and those who were looking to gain prestige that would be unattainable in Great Britain. In order to rule over another civilization, a British official had to believe in the superiority of British culture. The liberal philosophy believed that Indian civilization was undeveloped and played to mysticism. James Stuart Mill was perfectly suited to rule because he believed that India was an infant civilization that needed a strong British rule to become an adult culture.7 With such a philosophy, Mill and others like him justified the British rule through the idea that Britain was promoting cultural progress. Those who came to India for profit disregarded the traditional rule of Indians just like the liberals. Yet, those searching for a profit separated themselves from Indian society trying to have no influence or no positive influence over the Indian masses. The example of Warren Hastings leadership demonstrates the plundering aspect of the fortune seeking ruler in India.8 The desire to make money overpowered the necessity to effectively rule the nation that he claimed to control. Plundering of India's wealth was another way in which England brutally controlled India during British Indian rule. Finally, the last profile of British rulers in India were those seeking prestige. This subset mainly consisted of the Scottish and other underprivileged in Great Britain compared to those people who resided in England. A more psychological process was occurring in the minds of these rulers. The Scots were seen as somewhat second-class to the English, unlikely to get good jobs in London. A disproportionate amount of Scotsmen came to India compared to the English in India.9 The Scots were the brutalized of Great Britain and in turn treated the India people in a similar way that the English treated them. The later British rulers in India continued to perform as the earlier ones treating the Indians as lower class citizens than themselves. Brutality in British leadership was exemplified by the condescension and notion that the British and Indians were not equal.

British rule may have originally had positive intentions in an attempt to unite Indian civilization into a coherent nation controlled by the British. Yet, because the British would not or could not allow full equality for Indian citizens independence became necessary. The England that came to India was not the civilized protector, but brutal conqueror. Through biased education and unequal opportunities, through brute military force, and the indifference of leadership to the Indian population the British demonstrated themselves to be the savage, infant society that they claimed to be saving India from.",0,0,0,0,10333
Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Experience as History,"Evge'nia Ginzburg's Journey Into the Whirlwind provides an intimate portrait of one woman's experience as a political prisoner and gives the reader insight into the broader history of that woman's time. The work also describes the lives of those close to Ginzburg throughout various points in her ordeal, and these lives vary so greatly that the extensive nature of Stalin's purges is evident. The wide range of people Ginzburg encounters suggests that the terror of the purges was both real and justified, as anyone could fall victim to arrest. Robert Thurston argues that the Great Terror, was not nearly as widespread as we are led to believe, but Ginzburg's memoir demonstrates that ordinary people were affected, and their sufferings must not be minimized. The idea that fear was not a constant part of existence for everyone in the Soviet Union during this time is potentially true, but that does not change the fact that fear did exist and existed for good reason, as Ginzburg's story highlights the consequences that could be faced by anyone during the time of Stalin's Terror.

Ginzburg's telling of her experience is very personal and very real. She writes bluntly, sparing no horrific details. Every intimate moment is placed on display in the text, revealing the stark reality of prison life while allowing the reader to invest himself or herself in the eventual outcome. Small details throughout the text provide insight into the overall exaggeration of crimes that took place during the purges. One such moment occurs early in Ginzburg's interrogation. She is searched and then remarks, My terrorist equipment consisted of a pair of nail scissors I happened to have in my bag. 1 The heightened fear surrounding the arrests and interrogations led to a situation in which even the smallest thing, like possessing a pair of nail scissors, could be turned into a heinous crime. Ginzburg also relates her experience on the conveyer, an NKVD interrogation tactic which was fairly common but which seems all the more horrific when Ginzburg describes it.2 Because many of the things Ginzburg describes, like the conveyer, can be backed up with historical evidence, her work is provided with a sense of legitimacy that has a powerful affect on the reader.

The artfulness of the memoir is apparent in Ginzburg's frequent citation of historical events. As the work is a memoir, the historical references provide an anchor for the text overall. The timeline of the text is, in some ways, framed by the information Ginzburg and her fellow prisoners receive about the status of prominent Party members like Bukharin, Rykov, and Yezhov. The text also contains frequent footnotes, which provide the reader with additional historical information about the people and places mentioned. Major, more familiar historical events shape Ginzburg's experience and affect her emotions. She recalls, for example, the immense grief she felt at the death of Krupskaya, noting that it was the first time any of the prisoners cried after arriving at Yaroslavl.3 The prisoners clung to what information they could receive from newspapers like the Northern Worker, which Ginzburg was able to read while in prison at Yaroslavl, and thus written news stories are used to provide historical context for Ginzburg's narrative.

Literary allusions are also present throughout the text. Ginzburg includes many direct quotations from poetic works, all of which serve to provide cultural context for her experience. For Ginzburg, poetry was a means of staying sane, of finding a reason to live.4 She also found that poetry is a common bond for everyone. 5 In this way, all of literature, and thus memoir, can provide a means by which to unite others. Ginzburg's ability to recite the works of Pushkin potentially saved her life during her month-long train journey, and her ability as a writer would provide her with at least an iota of immortality. It was important to survive the gulag in order to make sure the terror and injustice of the time was not lost to history, and novel and memoir became a means of translating a sense of what living through the camp system would have been like to a younger generation. The idea of translating history through literary means is also evident in the works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Nadezdha Mandelstam. Through these written records, a sense of experience can be applied to historical knowledge.

Surviving the Terror provided a backdrop against which writers could share their experiences while enacting a sort of revenge upon Stalin's regime. Upon receiving her prison sentence of ten years instead of a death sentence, Ginzburg states, I intended to stay alive. Just to spite them. I was consumed by the desire to survive the tragedy which had befallen our Party. 6 She narrates with the fire of a loyal Party member, one who believes firmly that truth will win out and those who have been made captive will reclaim the Party for the true Communists. Her memoir serves to illustrate how the Terror did not destroy the Party outright, as Ginzburg herself never completely denounces the Party and is sure normalcy will return at the conclusion of the personality cult. The reader is constantly reminded of who Ginzburg is and what she stands for while reading, which serves to personalize history.

Ginzburg possesses a dark, ironic humor in her writing, perhaps a testament to the spirit she must have had in order to survive eighteen years as a political prisoner. Though her situation was dire, when reflecting back on it she is able to provide insight and critique her own actions and the actions of others. In describing a prison stairwell, she notes that The well was protected by thick wire netting so that no one might take it into his head to jump from the second floor and die on his own initiative instead of at the moment laid down by higher policy. 7 The starkness of this statement highlights not only the fact that suicide was perhaps a preferable alternative to prison, but also that prisoners were completely deprived of any personal choice. This moment is another detail that gives Ginzburg credibility and also tells the reader something they could probably not have learned in a purely scientific historical text.

The artfulness of the memoir also highlights the artificiality of experience and the surreal qualities of the whole interrogation process. Ginzburg writes that it was nearly impossible to make sense of one's experience as a political prisoner, as the system itself had no rhyme or reason to it. Her personal knowledge of suffering and the fact that she survived to tell her story are the only elements grounding her sense of experience in reality. One moment of the text that is particularly telling of the randomness surrounding the Terror is Ginzburg's encounter with the older peasant woman referred to as Grandma Nastya. Why she had drawn such an unlucky number in the lottery it was hard to say. Nobody could make anything of the accusation of 'Trotskyist terrorism' against Grandma. 8 This episode highlights why widespread fear was justified and why Robert Thurston's argument is not completely solid, as even ordinary people like Grandma Nastya could be arrested and sentenced to harsh punishments. Ginzburg herself cannot find any rhyme or reason in this situation, and can only reassure herself that her interrogators and judges were in fact the traitors.9 Throughout the text, she never loses this sense of herself, never once believing herself to be guilty. This belief is one shared by many of Ginzburg's fellow prisoners, who range from loyal Party members to Social Revolutionaries to people like Grandma Nastya.

Ginzburg makes particular note of the diversity of prisoners she encounters. When she has knowledge of their eventual fates, she shares it. This serves to remind the reader that these were real people. Often, Ginzburg informs the reader of what happened to certain individuals when they are first introduced, as is the case with Garey. The memoir is not told in a strictly chronological order, as Ginzburg reflects on certain experiences and certain people when she first mentions them. The reader knows that she spends two years at Yaroslavl from the outset, before she goes into any detail of that experience. This technique ensures that the reader will remember the outcomes, for it is one's final fate which was most important during this time period. Whether one lived or died is a crucial element for Ginzburg's portrayal of her fellow prisoners and others she encounters. This focus on what actually happened to people in the end lends a sense of humanity to the statistics concerning the number who died, providing faces and giving the reader a more intimate sense of history.

Another way in which Ginzburg successfully narrates history is in her description of the labor camps. The labor camp hierarchy usually gave preference to ordinary criminals, who often had a greater chance to obtain better jobs.10 This is a fact Ginzburg notes in her memoir, as she remarks that political prisoners were considered the lowest of all. The camp population was divided by the devilish ingenuity of our torturers into numerous 'classes.' 11 In Ginzburg's experience, the prisoners at the bottom of this hierarchy – the political prisoners with the longest sentences, those convicted under Article 58 –were often the least guilty of any inmates.12 Those who had been arrested earlier, before longer sentences were introduced, were more likely to have actual ties to counterrevolutionary activity. Ginzburg notes this with a sort of ironic clarity, her tone suggesting that, at that point, nothing could surprise her anymore.

Ginzburg also showcases the speed with which the tide could turn on those living in this time period. Her own experience is evident of this, as one day she was a respected Party member and the next she was dismissed and arrested. In addition, Ginzburg encounters many people whose luck would eventually run out, like Popov of the Butyrki prison. Before two of three months were out, he had ceased to be the governor of the jail and became one of its inmates. 13 Later on, Ginzburg also notes the fall of Yezhov, a man she saw as the architect of her experience, and the rise of Beria. Eventually, Beria too would find disfavor, but through everything people like Ginzburg managed to survive even the harshest treatment. These people are the faces of history, and their experiences provide insight into the history as a whole. These experiences alone speak to the terror of the late 1930s, and it is these experiences which are ultimately more important to history. In this sense, Robert Thurston's argument that fear was not widespread during this time misses the point, as fear was very real for victims of the purges.

Robert Thurston argues that pervasive fear was not commonplace during the time of the purges. The majority of Soviet citizens did not live in constant dread of sudden and inexplicable arrest. Thurston cites several people, including one whose father was arrested, as stating they felt that life continued as normal during the late 1930s.14 In some ways, this was probably true, as even Ginzburg suggests early on in her memoir. She herself did not fear arrest before she was arrested, although as a Party member she was affected by the death of Kirov. She feels as though the horrors of that December first follow her from then on, connecting her experience directly to Kirov's murder.15 In contrast, Thurston argues that The fear that resulted from Kirov's murder was probably more genuine anxiety regarding enemies than apprehension vis-à-vis the state. 16 If fear existed, it was because people were worried about the emergence of enemies to the state instead of a reaction to some state conspiracy. Throughout the purges, most Party members remained loyal – even those Party members who were arrested, like Ginzburg.17 Loyalty and fear, however, were not mutually exclusive, a fact Ginzburg highlights again and again in her descriptions not only of her own actions but also in the actions of others. The notion that fear was a natural reaction to events was all too true for those who were arrested, and this fear understandably drove deeper in some groups than it did in others.

It can be determined, then, that fear was more widespread among certain groups, including Party members, the military, and intellectuals.18 Especially in the case of the Party members, however, it would have made little sense for them to live in such a way that suggested their fear. Ginzburg notes that free Party members could not stand up to Stalin but were instead forced to bide their time and remain inconspicuous. One of Ginzburg's fellow prisoners speaks to the rationality of this inaction – A time will come for them to speak out, but why should they put their heads into the noose now when it won't do any good? 19 Assuming this statement is true, Party members who were not arrested likely did not go about their lives in a way which belied their fear but rather tried to maintain an aura of normalcy. For many members of certain ethnic groups, the Intelligentsia, and others, betraying one's fear of arrest suggested that one had done something to warrant arrest. Instead, Thurston takes the appearance of normalcy as a sign that most people were not living in fear. Additionally, Thurston makes little note of the peasants, who were major victims of the 1936-1938…Terror. 20 The group he focuses on the most, the young Party members, were in fact the ones who had most to gain from Stalin's purges.21 This group had no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the arrests and executions. It also stands to reason that speaking out against the arrests was a surefire way to ensure one's own arrest, so any protest would have been in vain.

The historical record suggests that most Soviet citizens did not feel the frequent arrests and executions were completely unwarranted.22 Many observers felt there must be some substance to [the] charges. 23 Great leaders would not confess to crimes they had not committed, or so it seemed to many at the time. This was especially true given that someone could be charged with treason for having even the smallest connection to someone like Trotsky, but all the public saw was the word treason. It was difficult to believe that former Soviet heroes would willingly slander themselves in this extravagant manner in public if the charges against them were false.24 Thurston also notes that even those who were arrested often believed that everyone's sentence was just but their own.25 This is contrary to what Ginzburg describes, however, as there is a general sense in her memoir that she encountered very few, if any, truly guilty people.

There was some doubt surrounding the legitimacy of the show trials, as it was difficult for people to fully accept the testimony given at court.26 The court records themselves were limited to confessions and witness testimony, not hard evidence, which calls into question the overall legality of the process.27 At the same time, “even if a person recognized that some injustice was occurring, that did not necessarily shake the conviction that enemies had to be rooted out.28 Even if the government did sometimes arrest innocents, as was understood and somewhat anticipated, their efforts in general supported Soviet security. Thurston argues, however, that it makes little sense for a government to arrest innocent, loyal people, even in the name of preserving the state.29 This is something Ginzburg notes as well, and her struggle to come to terms with her own arrest is present throughout her memoir. Based on Ginzburg's experiences and thoughts and those of others she depicts, it is possible to conclude that many prisoners were not able to figure out why they had been arrested or what the larger purpose of the purges was. These personal experiences shed light on what was clearly a very confusing period to live through.

Thurston is critical of memoirs, however, saying they must be used with great caution. 30 Memory is not a perfect thing, and exaggeration of events or people is highly possible. Ginzburg counteracts this by stating, During the long months and years I spent in various prisons, I was able to observe the virtuosity that human memory can develop when it is sharpened by loneliness and complete isolation from outside impressions. 31 Just as she was able to remember exact lines and minute details from things she had read long ago, so was she able to reconstruct her experience in the Soviet prison system into a unified history of her life. It is, however, still likely that Ginzburg created some of the dialogue from her imagination, not from memory, but the overall scope of her experience is supposedly accurate. She views it as a record of her ordeal, designed to inform a younger generation of all that transpired.32 What is ultimately important about Ginzburg's memoir is not that it details a widespread fear, but rather that it speaks to a universal hope that can be found in the darkest of times.

Ginzburg's memoir focuses on the experience of life as a political prisoner, but her remarks about the arbitrary nature of arrest and sentencing suggest that fear was justified, even if it did not exist to the extent that is commonly portrayed. Fear was not necessarily widespread, or, if it was, it was not felt before 1937.33 This is a reality repeatedly confirmed by Thurston, but it is also something suggested by Ginzburg. The fact remains, however, that fear need not be widespread in order to exist in some form. Just because they may not have lived in constant fear does not mean that the Soviet people did not suffer during this period.34 A sense of suffering, then, is the most important piece to take away both from Ginzburg's memoir and from this historical moment in general. The purges represent one of the worst examples of human suffering, and Ginzburg's memoir serves to put a face on that suffering. It can be determined that the purges did instill terror into the Soviet citizenry, and if they did not feel this fear constantly they at least suffered to a great extent, whether that suffering was economic, social, or emotional.35

The question of whether fear was a constant companion to all Soviet people during the late 1930s does not lend insight into what really occurred during this historical moment. The important element of this time period is not that fear was widespread, but rather that fear existed because of a real threat posed by Stalin's regime. In the end, the result of the purges, no matter the hysteria surrounding them, is that 700,000 were shot, ten to twelve million died in camps, and critical Soviet groups were decimated.36 Journey Into the Whirlwind provides an insider's view into this time period while conveying a sense of the larger historical context. Ginzburg's text is a testament to the human will; she remarks that People can get used to anything and can, in fact, survive anything.37 The importance of the Great Terror is not that terror was necessarily all-encompassing, but that it did affect the lives of every Soviet citizen in some manner or another. Some were affected more than others, and some did not survive at all, but the collective experience of those who survived serves as a lesson for future generations, and this is a lesson that can perhaps best be taught through the use of literary texts.

Political Science,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Power and the Urban Center,"Having, maintaining and controlling power is critical for governments, businesses, and citizens to achieve their political goals. For example, without zoning power, cities would have a hard time regulating where business locate within their city. Businesses might also have trouble getting a pro-business agenda passed if they did not significantly contribute to the tax base in a city. While power in a city is normally concentrated between local government, businesses and citizens, these three power sources normally hold very different types of power. Furthermore, the degree to which these three hold power and their method of obtaining power vary distinctly. This can often lead to power struggles where the interests of one group do not coincide with another.

For example, local governments have power in their communities because they have the legal authority to legislate. This authority comes directly from the powers the state grants a city which generally include power of taxation, zoning power, eminent domain, and other powers which influence behavior and helps the city accomplish their goals. However, a 19th century Supreme Court case now known as Dillon's Rule significantly limited the legal authority of cities. As a result of this case, cities only have as much legislative power as their state constitution allows. In addition to the limits of power that Dillon's Rule places on a city, city power is also limited by the power of businesses and citizens in the community.

Business interest, in particular, complicates the power balance in a city because while cities and corporations are necessary for each other to survive, their interests can be very different. For instance, Consumers Energy is currently working on a plan to expand the use of renewable energy in Michigan. Mr. Bruce Rasher, manager of renewable energy, plans on expanding the number of wind generators in Michigan. While speaking at Energy Day on campus, Mr. Rasher described installing wind generators in communities as exceedingly difficult because city governments and citizens are reluctant to change land zoning to permit wind generators in their communities. However, he went on to say that these generators would likely bring new jobs to the communities as well as increased tax revenue, which cities leaders would like to attract. This situation is very similar to many other daily decisions that cities and businesses must make. Businesses have a strong incentive to use their power in the form of wealth (and the revenue it generates for the city) and other economic influences to minimize their operating costs. At the same time, city governments have an incentive to maximize their total revenue to insure the economic viability of their city. Although many times a power struggle exists between cities and corporations, leaders oftentimes compromise to maximize the benefits to both cities and corporations.

Furthermore, the evolution of different types of city governments have complicated the power struggle within cities and have sometimes resulted in a significant power shift toward one of the three major power sources. The two major structures of city government, the mayor-council system and the council-manager system create different power balances within a city government and among businesses and citizens. A third, less used system of governance, the commission government, also changes the balance of power within a community. In the mayor-council mode of governance the community elects a city council and mayor who are responsible for legislative and executive decisions. Within this system, a city government can have a strong mayor system or weak mayor system.  In each case the mayor and city council have varying degrees of power to legislate but Ross and Levine contend that in each system the mayor has relatively little power.1 These systems complicate the balance of power within a city because their power is dispersed among the mayor and council members and this decreases any one member's accountability. Furthermore, it may make negotiating with businesses for tax breaks or other incentives more difficult because there is not a single person who holds most of the power. By contrast, a professionally trained, appointed official maintains administrative control of the city and the city council dictates policy and legislates in the council-manager system. This system can decrease potential accountability issues because the council and managers role is more clearly defined than in the mayor-council system. Also, having a full time, professional manager enables a city to establish a cohesive policy toward business owners and citizens because a manager does not face re-election issues and can hold the position for many years. However, the manager's position is becoming increasingly politicized and this may create significant ethical problems for a city. A third system of governing, governing by commission is much less common because each city commissioner is appointed head of a department in the city. This system can significantly disperse power in the city and creating power struggles between commissioners. As a result, very few cities adopt this model.

Power can be measured and conceptualized at different levels and how it is measured may distort a person's perception of power. For example, power may be judged by who wins and who loses. Under this model, people would view a business as powerful because it accomplishes its political goals more often than it loses. But people can also think of power as an ability to set the agenda and prevent governments from addressing important issues. For example, steel mills in Gary, Indiana regularly prevent the city government from discussing air pollution. The mills maintain significant power by keeping citizens from addressing the issue. Last and most subtlety, power may be viewed as the ability to shape cultural attitudes about particular issues. If an organization can change the culture of a community to accomplish its goals then it has exercised another type of power. Ultimately, power is the ability for city governments, businesses or citizens to accomplish their goals. While the formal structure of a city may change power balances each of the three major sources of power must use their strengths to seize power to affect change in their communities.",0,13.45,26.03,22.26,6372
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,"midterm, law and public policy/ constitutional law","Question 1B.
Because the new provision addresses political speech, any investigations into its constitutionality will involve a strict basis of review1. As such, two requirements must be met for the new provision to pass constitutional muster: 1) the state must prove a compelling interest for adopting the provision, 2) the provision must be narrowly tailored to that interest. In White, the Court acknowledged that maintaining the impartiality of the judiciary, with impartiality meaning openmindedness or the demand that [a judge] be willing to consider views that oppose his preconceptions, and remain open to persuasion 2, is desirable 3 and therefore a compelling state interest. The new provision adheres to this definition since it aims to prevent judicial candidates from committing to specific rulings before the fact; not allowing judicial candidates to pledge or promise certain outputs ensures that a potential judge remains openminded to both sides. Furthermore, unlike the announce clause, the proposed provision does not place any limitations on a candidate's expression of his/her position on certain issues; a candidate may still articulate his disapproval of abortion, but may not promise to rule against it should the matter come before him.

The new provision must also show that it is narrowly tailored to the aforementioned interest. The Court ruled that the announce clause was not narrowly tailored because it was under-inclusive in limiting statements only at certain times and in certain forms 4. A candidate could freely express his views on certain matters up until the very day before he declares himself a candidate 5. Justice Scalia noted Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion that statements made in an election campaign pose a special threat to openmindedness because the candidate, when elected judge, will have a particular reluctance to contradict them 6. Although Justice Scalia acknowledged this argument, he then countered that non-promissory statements don't pose enough of a threat to warrant the announce clause's under-inclusive tailoring. He argued instead that such a method of tailoring would be plausible only with respect to campaign promises  7 because a candidate will positively be breaking his word if he does not [rule in the manner he promised] 8. Because the new provision concerns promissory language, one can contend that its tailoring to campaign speech is narrow and consistent with its interest. Having met both requirements for strict scrutiny, one can safely assume that the new provision will survive constitutional inquiry.

The manner by which states appoint electors is governed by Article II of the constitution, which specifies that each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors. Those in opposition to the proposed plan may argue that the State, as a body politic, must appoint electors as a whole9. They argue that appointments of electors by districts are not an appointment by the State, because all citizens otherwise qualified are not permitted to vote for all the presidential electors 10. But because congressional districts represent parts of a whole, the combined result is the expression of the voice of the state 11, thus adhering to the stipulations of Article II. Also, state districts must be roughly equal in population12, thus further ensuring that each person has an equal part in choosing an elector.

The proposal's methods are also akin to the congressional mandate, which requires the election of congressional members through single member districts. Although Article 1, section 2 stipulates that the people of the several states shall elect members of Congress, the Court did not find constitutional fault in members being elected through districts rather than at large13; the interests of the people can therefore continue to be expressed despite the absence of statewide concurrence. Because congressional members can be elected through districts and still maintain the integrity of the people's voice, the proposed plan can similarly accomplish the same goal.

The question of who has the authority to approve change in elector selection, however, can raise an issue of constitutionality. Article II stipulates that the manner by which states appoint electors is directed by the Legislature thereof. Legislatures have plenary power…in the matter of the appointment of electors 14. Thus, because the current proposal is being attempted though a ballot initiative rather than a legislative mandate, it is not constitutional. The Court specifically noted in McPherson that determining the method of electoral selection is a question of power and not of policy 15, and it conferred that power exclusively 16 to the state legislature. Furthermore, the insertion of the clause legislature thereof in Article II was intended to operate as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power 17--the precise condition under which the proposed changes are being attempted.

IIA. Voting is a fundamental political right18, and it falls primarily upon the states to ensure its realization19. As such, states must ensure the equal weight of each vote, and it may not by arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another 20. The NAACP and voters from Steel Town and Iron city therefore challenge Michigana's use of punch card and lever machine voting systems—a method with leads to a higher likelihood of residual votes—in certain areas and not in others. They are likely to allege that such a practice violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, their guarantee to Due Process (also under the 14th Amendment), and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They will seek declaratory and injunctive relief which prevents the cities in question from using the less accurate voting machines.

Because the current question involves possible infringements on the right to vote, plaintiffs will request a strict standard of review21. However, the standard of scrutiny will not matter much since the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a similar case that the use of non error notice technology like the punchcard and lever systems would also fail under rational basis of review 22. They argue that the state has no legitimate interest to use technology that dilutes the right to vote 23. Steel Town and Iron City mayors claim that they don't have the necessary funds to purchase the more accurate machines. But the Court noted in Blackwell that added cost is not a justified or rational reason to not purchase the new machines since not having them comes at the expense of thousands of votes 24.

The plaintiffs argue that no state shall deny to any person…the equal protection of the laws 25, and Michigana's use of more accurate voting machines in certain cities and not in others violates this right. Their expert social scientist has demonstrated that the two cities using punchcard and lever machines display disproportionate rates of undervotes, thus qualifying their claim. Michigana allows local officials to choose which voting machines are used in their area, leaving some authorities to choose more accurate machines than others. This varying treatment leads voters in some counties [to be] statistically less likely to have their votes counted than voters in other counties in the same state 26. The district court for the Northern District of Illinois dealt with similar claims, ultimately ruling that any voting system that arbitrarily and unnecessarily values some votes over others cannot be constitutional 27.

The plaintiffs will allege that the arbitrary choice of which voting machines will be used in each city violates their right to due process. The plaintiffs, as in Black v. McGuffage, are questioning the statutory scheme which, depending upon the choices made by local election jurisdiction officials, will necessarily result in the dilution of an entire group of citizens' right to vote 28. Michigana's lack of a uniform standard for choosing voting machines leads to the use of machines with varying accuracy rates. Such a practice ultimately value[s] one person's vote over that of another 29 since it allows for the arbitrary treatment of voters. The state's procedure therefore leads to instances of fundamental unfairness 30. Ultimately, plaintiffs will argue that Michigana has no rational basis for its current practice, and as the Court ruled in McGuffage, a law that allows significantly inaccurate systems of vote counting to be imposed upon some portions of the electorate and not others…runs afoul of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution 31.

The use of less accurate machines in predominantly minority populated Steel Town and Iron city will raise complaints under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law condemns any practice that results in a denial or abridgement of the right…to vote on account of race or color 32. Although no outright denial of voting is being made against the plaintiffs, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a similar case that the Act clearly encompasses within the right of any citizen of United States to vote the right to have such ballot counted properly' 33. Because the plaintiffs' expert has found disproportionate rates of undervotes within the cities in question, they are being denied the right to have their ballots counted properly 34, which impedes their right to vote. The act is violated if under a totality of circumstances the political processes of elections are not equally open to participation to minority groups35. In McGuffage, the court established two statutory elements for a section 2 claim: 1) the use of a standard, practice or procedure which 2) leads to the diminution of minorities to take part in the electoral process36. Plaintiffs will therefore claim that the electoral process of deficient voting systems in the minority populated cities limits the members of those groups from taking part in electing their representatives. Plaintiffs will refer to the findings of their expert social scientist to demonstrate that the totality of circumstances reveal a discriminatory outcome.

As counsel to the governor, I would first advice him to raise a claim of res judicata, since the current suit bears much similarity to Suburban Action Coalition v. Goldman, et. al. case. In order to establish such a claim, three requirements must be made: 1) similarity in the identity of claims, 2) whether there was a final judgment on the merits, 3) privitiy between the parties 37. In Suburban, the plaintiffs demanded that Michigana use touch screen technology in the entire state. The evidence they presented in that case will therefore be the same as what the NAACP, et. al. will present: that the use of non-error warning technology like punchcard and lever systems leads to high incidences of residual votes, and ultimately dilutes the weight of their votes. Both cases therefore claim an infringement of the same right, the right to vote. The two cases also arise from the same nucleus of facts (the most important requirement in establishing a similarity of claims38) since the basic constitutional challenges to the use of outdated machines (violation of equal protection and due process) are the same. The only variation between the two cases is the current litigation's VRA claims, which I will diffuse shortly. Because the parties in Suburban entered a consent decree a final judgment was made on the merits of the case39. Finally, there is privity—which is established if the parties' interests are so closely aligned as to be virtually representative 40—between the parties in Suburban and the current litigation. Although the plaintiffs in Suburban were residents of suburban areas and did not include members of the urban areas in question, their interests are nonetheless the same: to change the voting machines in Michigana. The plaintiffs' interest in Suburban are representative since their remedy demanded a change for the entire state, not just their areas. The interests of the current plaintiffs were therefore acknowledged in the previous case, thus establishing privity between the parties. If res judicata is invoked, the current litigation will be halted.

The plaintiffs VRA complaints can be countered by noting that rural areas, which don't have heavy minority populations, have not adopted touch screen voting machines. One can argue that these areas are also likely to have large numbers of residual votes though they lack a large minority population. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances no infringement on rights due to race has been made.

Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Direct vs. Indirect Effects of the Supreme Court,"Today the Supreme Court is often seen as wielding a substantial amount of power by definitively determining the constitutionality of laws made by our government and striking them down if they do not believe them to be in like with the Constitution. Though it appears to be a considerable oddity that an unelected tribunal of eight would have almost unchecked power to determine what laws are ok and what laws are not, in today's current political and judicial culture it often seems to be the case. An apprehension that might arise in the mind of someone concerned with adhering to the democratic process at least procedurally then might be, so how much power does the Supreme Court really have? The answer is a two-pronged response that concerns direct and indirect affects of the Court. Gerald Rosenberg makes an excellent argument for the lack of direct affects the Court is capable of unless under very particular, fortuitous circumstances. He then also makes a case against the indirect affects that the court is capable of and proposes several arguments against many of the indirect affects of the Courts. Rosenberg seems to underestimate two potential indirect affects of the Court though; their value in creating backlash that can eventually help a cause, and working with grass roots organization in order to sustain social movements that could otherwise be squelched without the help of the law.

As Rosenberg says in the first chapter of The Hollow Hope, as far as focusing on the court being an effective producer of significant social reform, there are claims about frequency and claims about conditions. Rosenberg describes that to fully understand the role of the courts in producing significant social reform, we must focus on the latter, 1 There are certain conditions that must be in place for the court to have any direct affect on social change reform. The first restraint is that they must convince courts that the rights they are asserting are required by constitutional or statutory language, 2 This first restraint proved to be a major stumbling block in the case of Rosa Parks. The NAACP thought that they would seize upon the situation involving the arrest of Rosa Parks and use it as a focal point of a legal attack on the constitutional rights involved with being able to sit where you want on a public bus. Unfortunately, the case kept getting tangled up in the local and state courts instead of reaching any type of constitutional level, and instead the court relied on a method commonly seized upon by state courts as a reason for not addressing a party's federal claim: Counsel had failed too comply with some rule of state procedure. 3 It was difficult to even get the issue to be considered on a constitutional level, let alone then prove that the constitutional language protected it.

The second restraint is that courts are wary of stepping too far out of the political mainstream. 4 The Court, while an independent institution, does rely at least in part on the federal government, and they are still subject to the system of checks and balances by Congress who by take action against them. The Court does not often make decisions that more than 50% of the population is against because of the enormous amount of heat that would be generated by the populous and their representatives would mount against a widely unpopular decision. The third constraint that Rosenberg mentions is that since the judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse… but merely judgment, 5 litigants are faced with the task of implementing the decisions, 4 and without compliance of the other branches of government, court decisions are often rendered useless given much opposition 4. Brown, a case that took place with all of these constraints in position illustrates that based on the numbers…the Supreme Court contributed virtually nothing to ending segregation of the public schools in the Southern states in the decade following Brown, 6. The only places that desegregation occurred were border-states and in isolated portions of the peripheral South, 7 that were already lacking the second constraint and thus the third constraint because their state and local governments were willing to implement the Court's decisions.

Many, even if they don't agree with some of the particulars of Rosenberg's positivist reasoning, still concede that it is at least much more difficult to make direct changes based on court rulings when the constrictions are in place. It is in fact widely acknowledged that Brown's direct impact on school desegregation was limited, 8 though it is perceived by many as being absolutely crucial in the achieving of civil rights. Even the dynamic court view, which generally believes that courts can be effective producers of significant social reform, still concedes, courts are unlikely to produce significant social reform it just does not deny the possibility that courts can potentially create social reform. This view insists that the constraints are not as strong as the constrained court view would suggest, and that the court can provide 'equality of both access and influence to citizens' more 'completely' than any 'other institutional form,' 9 The Court is a uniquely reactive institution while the other institutions have much more proactive power, and therefore individuals are in a unique position to be able to bring a case to the Court without having to be part of the majority or winning coalition. Yet one must assume the equality of access and influence, which unfortunately is by no means a necessary truth. More often than not, people who are more educated, with more resources and funds to pull from, will be the ones who are able to bring their case to the Supreme Court. Therefore it is true the Court has potential to be an incredibly valuable institution, but there are many factors that might hinder it from filling its potential.

Rosenberg also makes that case that not only can the courts not have a direct affect under these constraints, but the court won't have any indirect affects either.

Both he and Michael Klarman utilize positivist methods to determine the indirect affects of court decisions. They both determine that though the Brown decision might have forced the idea of civil rights onto the national agenda, in reality only 17% of northern whites were aware of the decision after it was made. 60% of southern whites were aware of the decision, but unfortunately instead of goading civil rights progress it resulted instead in a tremendous backlash against the decision. They consider how the decision could have pricked the consciousness of northern whites by placing the moral authority of the Court and the Constitution behind the black demand for desegregation 10 but it is difficult to believe it effectively did this on any sort of significant scale if only 17% of northern whites were even aware of the case. Thirdly there is the claim that the decision inspired black protest by legitimizing the civil rights cause or by improving the prospects for its success, 10.Yet African-Americans were surely already aware without the court decision that their desire for civil rights was legitimate, and the civil rights efforts were actually more vibrant during and directly after WWII and during the 60's than they were proceeding Brown. So even if it did inspire some African Americans, it wasn't on any visible, large-scale basis.

McCann, agrees with the fact that legal tactics narrowed in effectiveness as courts narrowed constructions of civil rights later in the decade, and therefore that the courts effectiveness can be constrained as a defender of civil rights, but still maintains that the court can have affective indirect affects regardless. He attributes the inability of researchers like Rosenberg to produce results that corroborate McCann's findings because of the positivist, causal method employed as opposed to a more complex, probing research methods that treats contexts as complex webs of multiple dynamically interactive, contingent 'social relations' that both constrain and facilitate the reflexive actions of research subjects, 11 McCann makes several points regarding the effectiveness of the Supreme Court decision in the context of the pay equality movement of the 1980's. He makes several good points regarding the laws indirect affect as far as establishing legal norms and conventions to be used by those involved in the social movement, educating people on the issue through relatively widespread media coverage, and sparking collective political action.

Though McCann believes even during the era of wage reform that federal Courts generally have lacked both the will and the capacity to correct discriminatory wage practices but that nevertheless…legal norms…shaped the terrain of struggle over wage equality 12 the equal pay movement still occurs under much more favorable conditions than the civil rights movement and Brown took place. Courts were more willing to use the Constitution in order to guard against civil rights infractions specifically, and they were not subject to the three major constraints that the Court was subject to during the Brown decision. The absence of the second constraint in particular changed the way the decisions reached and affected the populous. In the Brown decision, the Court was stepping far outside of the mainstream, at least within the South, and thus there was no sympathetic widespread media coverage generated, no educational effect and no rallying together of dispersed civil rights forces. Yet since the majority of the public was behind the Court decisions made during the equal pay movement, all of these things were possible, and the Court decisions had a much more significant affect. The absence of the third constraint was also extremely helpful to their cause, because now not only was the public generally willing to implement Court decisions, but the Court also enjoyed the support of the federal government and local governments with implanting their decisions, and thus further change was enabled. Rosenberg would tend to agree with McCann, that under conditions lacking the three main constraints, the Court is in fact able to produce social change.

There are though, two indirect affects of Court cases in particular that Rosenberg seems to dismiss or not really address, that have the ability to contribute substantially to social change. The first affect is interesting because it is probably the most indirect way the Court can bring about change; that is the Court is capable of bringing about change because of the backlash generated by their decisions, against their decisions. As Klarman describes, the backlash in Brown, crystallized southern resistance to racial change…temporarily destroyed southern racial moderation and thus generated nationally televised scenes of southern law enforcement officers using police dogs, high-pressure fire houses… which converted millions of previously indifferent northern whites into enthusiastic proponents of civil rights legislation, 13 The Brown decision, which as previously mentioned reached more than half of the southern white population actually created a political environment in which southern elected officials stood to benefit at the polls by boldly defying federal authority and brutally suppressing civil rights demonstrations, 14 This transformation of the south combined with the non-violent tactics of those involved in the protests created scenes and images that were in fact finally enough to prick the conscious of the northern white, and mobilize enough people in the federal government and in the public at large to throw the full force of Congress and the executive behind the enforcement of civil rights, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This backlash shouldn't be confused with the Court's decision having the direct affect of pricking the conscious of northern whites, because Brown's ruling itself was not enough to do this. This is though, an example of how the Court's decisions do have the capacity to indirectly effect social change, though not a necessarily intuitive way.

The second way in which the Court appears to be able to help bring about social change is that sometimes its decisions, or lack of decisions, have the capability of sustaining a social movement. As Robert Glennon says, prolonged human effort, no matter how righteous the case, does not inevitably result in favorable political change, 15 He points out several moments in particular during the Montgomery bus boycott, such as Browder v. Gayle, seeking an injunction against further segregated seating on buses, relying on Brown v. Board of Education as legal authority, and against legal harassment of the car pool. 16 where the decisions of the Supreme Court at least technically enabled civil rights movements occurring on the ground to continue. Those involved in the Montgomery bus boycott were relying on their ability to carpool, so those boycotting could still get around. Judge Carter, a state court judge issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the continued operation of the car pool on November 13, 1956, but this was only after the Supreme Court issued a ruling that upheld an earlier ruling of Browder that struck down the Alabama and Montgomery ordinances requiring segregation on Montgomery City Lines buses, 17 While there was still enormous amounts of resistance from the population and even the lower courts (as illustrated by the actions of Judge Carter), it did prove helpful to the movement that might not have ultimately succeeded without the support of the Supreme Court. The law could have been turned directly against the protesters, and it can be assumed that most of the locals would have been happy to enforce it. At least with the law with the protesters, even if local people wanted to continue to stop the protests, they wouldn't have any legal imperative to increase their efforts to do so, and in fact might actually get in trouble further down the road to continue with their actions.

This is not to say that the Supreme Court decisions may have inspired the Montgomery black community to challenge segregation, 18 or that the Court's decisions alone then single handedly allowed for each grass roots civil rights movement to succeed. Often times, as Glennon himself illustrates in his work, the courts, (the lower courts especially) actually often impeded social justice by blatantly ignoring Supreme Court decisions, like Justice Carter as well as the Alabama Court of Appeals did with Browder, and thus not implementing them in their communities, or by obscuring the language as they did with Rosa Parks case as to make it not a constitutional issue but a state statue issue. Glennon actually describes how this ground breaking Browder ruling did not actually end up resulting in desegregation, because peaceful integration ended a few days later, when someone fired gunshots into King's home and several city buses,.19 that then shut down the bus lines. The Supreme Court's decisions then clearly did not solve the issue of bus segregation. It did form a necessary link though in a chain of events that ultimately led to real change that the federal government finally took in 1964, after backlash like that generated by the Browder and Brown rulings got enough national media attention to finally push the northern public and the federal government to the side of actively protecting civil rights.

Our society tends to idolize certain court decisions like Brown v. Bored of Ed., as well as certain social movements such as the Montgomery bus boycott. More often than not though, it is simply impossible for any single one of these events to have the cataclysmic affect that our society at large, as well as certain scholars, attribute to them. It is not necessarily true that the existence and strength of pro-civil-rights forces at least suggest that change would have occurred 20 without any interventions from the courts, nor is it necessarily, nor even probably, true that the Montgomery protest failed to produce any change in the transportation system and that the intervention of federal courts caused that change and paved the way for achievement of the other long-term success,.21 It is actually quite apparent that the Supreme Court's ruling was continually flouted and ignored by most southern whites and local courts and law enforcement. Glennon himself concedes that voluntary integration of buses and trains occurred in some upper South cities though bus companies shied away from integrating terminals and as of 1960, only limited bus integration had taken place in the deep South,.21 It was a mix of massive, public grass roots involvement, court cases, backlash against the court cases and involvement and sympathetic media coverage that was eventually able to turn the tides of civil rights protection in the United States.",0,0,0,7.45,16949
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Hannah Arendt's Conception of Totalitarianism,"While Hannah Arendt's work, The Origins of Totalitarianism was groundbreaking in its time and introduced the idea of totalitarianism as a novel political phenomenon, her theories are limited by the contradictions present within her arguments. These contradictions are particularly present in her discussion of the structural qualities of totalitarianism. Her arguments regarding the psychological explanations for how totalitarian movements come about, attain power, and are perpetuated are particularly compelling and not hindered by the inconsistencies present elsewhere in the book.

Arendt's explanation of the rise of totalitarian movements in the early 20th century hinge upon the concept of the atomized man, someone who felt completely disconnected from all organizations and institutions, and was thus able to be swept up into the total sublimation of the self required by totalitarian ideologies. This willingness to sacrifice the self seemed to be a …salvation from the automatic identification with pre-established functions in society and their utter banality, and at the same time to help destroy the functioning itself. 1 For those who had just lived through the unbelievable cruelty and waste of human life that was World War I, committing themselves to a movement whose ideology was based upon a certain level of cruelty was a way to combat the bourgeois and hypocritical liberal humanitarian ideals of the time. Joining a totalitarian movement was the ultimate renunciation of the status quo, and did indeed attract a disproportionate number of society's outcasts.

Totalitarian ideologies were devoted to the attainment of a utopian future world (whether race or class-based) and were so powerful precisely because they were so removed from the average citizen's daily existence. By focusing on the achievement of a paradisiacal world rule, which would be achieved due to the supra-human forces of history (although it would take longer without the help of mankind), these ideologies were able to create a pseudo-religious fervor in their adherents. The leader of the totalitarian movement maintained power through his ability to correct interpret and predict the historical trends upon which the ideology was based, and which would direct the movements' course of action. The semi-religious nature of these ideologies made it impossible for a doubter to reason with adherents. Totalitarian ideologies …presented disagreements as invariably originating in the deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual... 2 Prophecies and faith-based movements cannot be held accountable to logic, reasoning, or even facts.

The global ambitions of totalitarian movements allow them to demand complete self-sacrifice from their adherents, even before they attain power. As the ideology will, in time, encompass the entire human race, it would be absurd for followers not to be totally and unconditionally loyal and uncritical towards the movement.3 The prophetic nature of the leader's interpretation of totalitarian ideology does have its drawbacks, however. As the ideology is based on supra-human trends and the leader is the only person who is able to interpret these, the leader must be infallible. While totalitarian ideologies cannot be disputed through rational arguments from outsiders, inconsistencies within the movement might prove to cause disillusionment amongst the followers and potentially even be fatal to the movement itself. The leader must thus do everything within his power to make his prophecies come true, even if this means subverting the expressed aims of the original ideology.4 Once again, this shows how totalitarian movements can never be completely secure without world domination, for only in a world completely under the totalitarian leader's control can he manipulate actions so that he is never incorrect.

Arendt argues that structurally, Nothing is more characteristic of the totalitarian movements in general and of the quality of fame of their leaders in particular than the startling swiftness with which they are forgotten and the startling ease with which they can be replaced. 5 While theoretically this appears plausible, it is difficult to think of two leaders who have remained more enduring in the public consciousness than Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin – the two leaders that Arendt points to as exemplifying totalitarian movements. Although the notion that the actual person who leads a totalitarian movement is not as important as the fact that they have manipulated the governmental system to such a degree that they wield an unheard of amount of power in the individual citizen's life fits in well with Arendt's theories regarding the ephemeral structure of totalitarian governments, it does not correlate with the historical examples of totalitarianism. Some credence must be given to Raymond Aron's assertion that particular personalities matter; that to …pass from the potential to the actual…something quite unique was needed – Stalin himself. 6 Aron believes that while many autocratic regimes have the potential to become totalitarian, there must be a specific personality who is able to take the movement to such an extreme situation. Arendt would disagree with this assertion, as she believed that totalitarianism was a completely novel form of government, not a matter of degree of extremism.

The inapplicability of Arendt's assertion on the importance of a specific totalitarian leader as compared to historical events is further heightened through her own contradictory statements. Later on in the book, when describing the amorphous hierarchy that she believes characterizes a totalitarian state, Arendt argues …its whole hierarchy has been efficiently trained for a single purpose – swiftly to communicate the will of the Leader to all ranks. When this has been achieved, the Leader is irreplaceable because the whole complicated structure of the movement would lose its raison d'être without his command. 7 Although it could be contended that Arendt is merely stating that there must always be a supreme leader, as opposed to a specific person remaining in power, this seems unconvincing. I tend to find Arendt's second assertion more compelling because it places a higher premium on the specific personality of the leader within a totalitarian system and the level to which the entire governmental structure is merely a reflection of their accumulation of power.

Arendt further contradicts herself when discussing the role of terror and violence within a totalitarian system. She begins by stating that violence is predominantly used by totalitarian movements in their initial power-seeking stage to frighten their political opposition. Later on, she argues, terrorism is used simply to further their ideological objectives.8 This makes sense as intuitively it seems as if totalitarian governments would minimize their use of terrorism once in power. However, later on Arendt states that, Terror continues to be used by totalitarian regimes even when its psychological aims are achieved: its real horror is that it reigns over a completely subdued population. 9 This contradiction confuses the reader as to the actual role of terror by a totalitarian government once in power. Although intuitively it seems as if violence would be decreased once the movement attained power, we know that historically this was not the case. It could be argued that all of the violent and terroristic actions which were undertaken in Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union were done for the purpose of fulfilling their ideological goals. The totalitarian governments would certainly maintain this was the case. In addition, it could be argued that whether or not the violence committed worked towards maintaining a feeling of instability within the state, which would have helped to solidify the power of the totalitarian government.

While Arendt does an exemplary job of explaining the psychological reasons behind the appearance of totalitarian governments in post-World War I society, her contradictions when discussing the structural nature of these movements significantly detracts from her arguments. The ideologies which totalitarian movements upheld attracted the atomized masses of the early 20th century, who felt that by subsuming themselves in a supra-human belief system which explicitly upheld the importance of cruelty, they were combating the liberal hypocritical nature of contemporary society. The global aspirations of these movements prevented their adherents from expressing any criticism of the ideology or those working on behalf of it. In addition, totalitarian leaders were motivated to global domination in order to ensure that their prophecies would come true. Arendt's view of the importance of a totalitarian movement's leader's personality is muddled, but I feel that some significance must be attributed to Aron's argument that it takes a specific personality to move from a totalitarian possibility to an actuality. Again, contradictions limit the usefulness of Arendt's views on the role on terror within a totalitarian movement that has attained power.",0,0,0,3.61,9189
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Leave for Family Responsibility in the United States,"Introduction
The second wave of the feminist movement struggled for the entrance into the public sphere of women who previously had been confined to working in the home. This movement has lead to many positive changes in the lives of both women and men in the workforce. One such improvement is that women who are now able to compete for jobs, including high paying jobs, can support their families in the same manner as men. This not only helps to empower women, but also allows men more freedom in their job choices as they need no longer be the sole breadwinner. However, maternity and family responsibilities were omitted from this discussion, an oversight which is not universal. For example, the feminist movement in the United States was shaped very differently from that in Europe, where maternity and mothers' rights were considered vital battles towards women's equality. In the United States, the movement considered these rights special treatment. While the view of feminists in the United States is shifting towards the European position, history cannot be changed (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave). Because of this, the movement towards equality at work is by no means complete, the glass ceiling has not yet become a thing of the past, and the rights of maternal and paternal workers do not approximate those of workers in the rest of the developed world. For instance, the United States and Australia are the only industrialized countries that don't provide paid leave for new mothers nationally… (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave). Further:

In a study from McGill University's Institute for Health and Social Policy, the United States, Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea were the only countries out of 173 studied that didn't guarantee any paid leave for mothers. Among the 168 countries that do, 98 of them offer 14 or more weeks of paid leave (Schweitzer).

With the hard work and dedication of organizations such as the Center for WorkLife Law, legislation and legal cases in the United States are starting to move in the proper direction towards rights that may finally help shatter the glass ceiling. Through this advocacy, and congressional action enumerating the rights of pregnant women and new parents, employers will be forced to re-evaluate and update their policies on leave for pregnant women and family responsibilities.

Current Actors
There have been unsuccessful attempts in past administrations and in Congress to pass legislation requiring paid maternity leave, such as the Clinton administration‘s effort to give states the ability to use unemployment funds for such leave. This particular idea was turned down by the Bush administration because of opposition from business groups concerned with increased contribution to state unemployment funds (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave). Because of this slow movement in the government and the strength of the lobbying parties attempting to keep this legislation from passing, much of the fight for maternity and paternity rights has taken place in the workplace with mothers and fathers suing their employers when they find themselves being discriminated against due to their capacity as parents. Parents of newborn children have not been alone in suing for family responsibility discrimination; there have also been cases of pregnant women and adoptive parents. Partly due to the fact that there is no legislation for small businesses, and partly because current laws do not cover all discrimination, there have been many cases by individual citizens, spanning people who have been rejected for employment, passed over for promotion, subjected to hostile work environments, and terminated based solely on employers' negative assumptions (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees With Family Responsibilities: A model Policy for Employers, 1).

Due to the unintended consequences of the feminist movement, and the omission of pregnant women and new parents from legislation, even as recently as in the George W. Bush administration, advocates have had to utilize alternative routes in order to try to gain rights for mothers and fathers facing discrimination in the workplace. Even though individuals have filed most of the lawsuits, there are advocacy groups helping them wage their battles while at the same time fighting to change policy and public perceptions. The Center for WorkLife Law is one such organization. A nonprofit organization that conducts research as well as advocating for family responsibility rights, they collaborate with many groups, including employees, employers, attorneys, legislators, journalists and researchers. With the organizational goal of identifying and preventing discrimination due to one's family responsibilities (WorkLife Law), members of this organization have written many news articles helping to educate people on their rights in the workforce and bring light to the different sides of the issue. In these articles, they not only give the side of employees, but also include articles such as, Is Maternal Profiling a Problem in the Workplace? in which two women discuss the legitimacy of claims by both employers and employees in an action reaction piece with the employers claims listed second. While it is helpful to give a well-rounded argument that touches on the issues of your opponent, it calls into question the claims that are actually trying to be furthered. By not contradicting the rebuttal argument, it is left solely to the reader to decide the legitimacy of the group's claim, a dangerous position for an advocacy group. Instead, they should have acknowledged the argument of their opponent followed by a discussion discounting it. Even with this criticism, the Center for WorkLife Law does much more good than harm. They are acting in a very effective way by not only providing educational journal articles, but also providing an easy search for lawyers who will be arguing these cases in the future. By making a collection of past lawsuits, they are helping attorneys give their clients the best representation because they can draw from past successful cases. One other positive service that the Center provides to further their cause is a model policy that they have designed to help companies reform and give equal rights to pregnant women and new parents.

Legal Cases
Lawsuits have been filed in many jurisdictions throughout the United States because there is a lack of adequate legislation and because the Supreme Court has not created a precedent by hearing a case on the subject. Stereotyping on the part of employers is a large part of why so many cases are brought, examples of this being where employers make, outdated and incorrect assumptions about how a parent…will act or should act and then made personnel decisions based on those stereotypes (e.g., a man should not care for his infant, or a woman who is a mother won't be able to concentrate on her job) (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 1). The Center for WorkLife Law goes on to describe that even in situations where the employee has been exemplary, assumptions have still been made resulting in repercussions such as losing rank in an office, or harassment in order to attempt to force these workers to leave their job (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 1). Employees have not taken these abuses lying down; they have brought to court, and successfully won, many cases on their rights as parents and pregnant women.

These individuals have used at least five federal anti-discrimination statutes in their lawsuits” (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 1). The Equal Pay Act of 1963 guarantees that sex would not be a determining factor in salary. Any persons who perform the same job must be paid the same amount (The Equal Pay Act of 1963). This Act allowed pregnant women to stop their employer from both affecting their pay because of pregnancy and forcing them out of jobs they were still qualified to do. Another congressional bill that has been used to successfully sue employers of pregnant women and people with new families is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. It affects employers who either own a business that has ties to the public sphere, or employers whose business has over fifty employees and is involved in any business that is involved with commerce. Employers who fit this description must give an eligible employee who is having, adopting, or has recently had a child, is taking care of a sick family member, or who cannot work for personal medical issues, up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during any calendar year (Compliance Assistance—Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)). While this seems to be very progressive and helpful, it is important to keep in mind that the United States is one of only two developed nations that do not provide monetary support to new parents. When coupled with the reality that not all workers can afford to take such an extended period of time without salary, it becomes clear that this policy is, in fact, lacking. A third congressional act that has been used to protect family responsibility rights is Title VII which protects employees on the basis of sex, among others, and gives employees the right to have a workplace free of sexual harassment. Pregnancy is covered under Title VII because it is a state of being that can only be achieved by one sex. Parenting is included when one sex is not considered while the other is, such as not giving men leave when it is available to women. It does not, however, hold that sex can never be the basis for employment decisions. There are three requirements for employers to prove their hiring choices are legal: they must show that there is a direct relationship between gender and the ability to perform the duties of the position they are to fill and that it relates to the essence of the business. Lastly, there must be no less-restrictive or more reasonable alternatives than barring one sex. In 1978, the Pregnancy Protection Act was added, giving pregnant women the right to get the treatment equal to any employee with a temporary illness (Federal Laws Prohibiting Job Discrimination Questions and Answers: Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Laws). Following these actions, the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, prohibiting private employers as well as governments from discriminating against people with disabilities if they were qualified for a job (The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Titles I and V). These last two congressional acts are especially dangerous to use as protections because of the way they label pregnant women as disabled or ill. Childbirth is a natural part of human life that is most often not debilitating; to label it as an illness is not an accurate statement of the woman's condition. This conflation of conditions decentralizes both causes and makes it more difficult to fight for the rights of either.

Locally, employees have used state statutes that give more protection and specifically list parental status as a protected class. Outside of using discrimination, employees have also argued, and won, claiming wrongful discharge, breach of contract, inflictions of emotional distress, and tortuous interference with business relations (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 1-2).

In San Francisco, California, the case of Lopez v. Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc. was tried in 2007. When Lopez, a pregnant delivery driver, informed her employer of her condition, she was put on an involuntary, unpaid leave within the hour. When she asked why these actions had been taken, she was told that her employer did not feel she could do her job any longer even though her only medical restriction was that she could not lift more than 20 pounds. Her troubles worsened when she was told she was going to lose her health benefits and could not be hired for another position in the company; she was subsequently fired. Because of the improper handling of her pregnancy and the illegal termination of her job during medical leave, Lopez was granted $2,340,700 in damages for time lost and emotional stress (Recent and Noteworthy FRD Cases). This case was handled correctly because the plaintiff's rights were recognized, and she was not deemed handicapped by her pregnancy. This case is a good example of the fact that pregnant women are not disabled and can continue their work as usual. The company could have saved themselves millions of dollars had they just enacted an appropriate policy in relation to pregnant women.

Cases that involve new parents are also common. One such example is Back v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free School District. The complainant in this case was a school psychologist who was denied tenure in spite of outstanding performance reviews. She was told by her supervisors that it was not possible for [her] to be a good mother and have this job as well as that they did not know how she could perform her jobs with little ones (Recent and Noteworthy FRD Cases). The deciding Court held that the use of stereotypical assumptions about a mother's commitment to her job, standing alone, constitutes sex discrimination in violation of Title VII (Recent and Noteworthy FRD Cases). This case demonstrates how cases argued using Title VII are extremely positive for women's rights. These cases do not ask for any sort of special treatment, only demand an equal opportunity for jobs they are equally qualified to fill. Title VII cases also do not constitute pregnancy as a disability.

Women are not the only workers to bring suit against their employers for discrimination based on family responsibility. In 2001, the fourth circuit heard the case of Knussman v. Maryland. In this case, a male state trooper filed suit against his employer when he was not permitted to take medical leave after his wife had a difficult delivery. Knussman was awarded $665,000 under the Family Medical Leave Act. This case showed prejudice deeper than just not allowing a man to take leave when his supervisor made comments such as, 'God made women to have babies,' and that his wife would have to be 'dead or in a coma' before he could be considered a primary caregiver and get family medical leave, (Recent and Noteworthy FRD Cases). It is through cases such as this that one can see the need for advocacy groups such as the Center for WorkLife Law. By utilizing their connections to media sources and helping reeducate employers, the groups can help to rid the workplace of these stereotypes.

Examples for restructured policy
As women gain more access to the workforce, and men begin to take on family responsibilities in the home, changes to policy have to be made to keep pace with these changes. This is not all negative for employers. Changes do not have to be drastic: if an anti-discrimination policy already exists, small changes to that current policy can be as effective as creating new policy. However, if no policy exists, one must be added to the company's policies. The crucial point to these changes is that pregnancy and family responsibilities must be added to the list of classes that cannot be discriminated against in the workplace. This addition may create needs to amend other policies as well that are affected by the anti-discrimination policies (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 1).

The Center for WorkLife Law notes that a change for existing legislation could be modeled to say, It is the Company's policy not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin or ancestry, marital status or family responsibilities, veteran's status, or disability… (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees with Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 2). It is important, as noted earlier, that family responsibilities are not combined with disability in this model. It is extremely important to women's and disability rights to maintain a distinction between a common, temporary, condition such as pregnancy and a disability or illness, which has very different battles to wage.

The second option is to have a policy that stands alone and speaks only of family responsibility discrimination. The upside to this type of legislation is that it allows employers to give their employees and supervisors more information about this specific type of discrimination. The Center for WorkLife Law states that extra information listed could include, that personnel decisions relating to hiring, terms and conditions of employment, advancement, and termination will not be affected by parental or other family care giving obligations, (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees With Family Responsibilities: A Model Policy for Employers, 3). This type of policy is also positive because it more fully outlines steps to be taken in a situation involving family responsibility discrimination.

As the fight to give pregnant women and those that have new families continues affecting governmental acts through agencies such as the Center for WorkLife Law and as individual cases continue progressing legal rights, women are finding themselves closer than ever before to breaking through the glass ceiling. However, there is still far to go in the United States; agencies and individuals must press for paid leave, allowing parents the best opportunity for raising a family while staying confident about finances. The biggest rejection to this idea is the cost to employers; however, there are many ways around this worry. For instance, California has a fund which employees pay into instead of employers. By doing this, they provide six weeks at 50% pay for their new parents (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave). This is only one option, there are many more out there, but one thing is abundantly clear: to maintain the position of a global leader, the United States must model its family responsibility laws after the many countries throughout the world that offer these benefits and still create an atmosphere of productivity.",71.66,71.79,30.45,25.63,18473
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,U.S. Civil Liberties," Our history has seen a broad range of limitations of individual rights in order to ensure national security. In February 1942, President Roosevelt, using his authority under Article II, Section 2 as Commander-In-Chief, issued Executive Order 9066, authorized the Armed Forces to hold anyone with Foreign Enemy Ancestry in interment – swiping away constitutional rights from Japanese-Americans and nationals of Japanese descent. Almost 120,000 Japanese were relocated from the west coast to camps in the interior, with 62 percent of them being legal US citizens (Executive Order 9066). Japanese living in America were denied due process guaranteed by the Constitution. With this policy in place, the United States government essentially said that Japanese living in America were a threat to security and therefore needed to be contained in camps. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the president created the Office of Homeland Security with the vague mission to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorists' threats or attacks (Dycus, 635). Congress also acted quickly to pass the USA Patriot Act of 2001 that granted vast powers to the executive branch over citizens and resident aliens that also included the suspension of certain constitutional rights (enumerated in the 1st, 4th, and 6th Amendments). For example, the Patriot Act eradicates the personal privacy an individual has over his library, financial, medical, phone, internet, or educational records. In my opinion, these steps are well intentioned to maintain security, but grant too much unchecked authority to the federal government by curtailing civil rights and liberties.

In both instances, I appreciate the thinking that led to these initiatives as regarding national security and the prevention of harmful attacks on the country but am opposed to the actual measures taken. For example, history has proven that the internment camps were a very flawed response by the government and the Supreme Court has ruled parts of the USA Patriot Act unconstitutional. These actions were carried out by legislation of the Congress, by suggestion of the executive, who in so doing did not exceed their presidential powers except in that the actions were inconsistent with the Constitution. In this way, their actions were not usurpations of congressional authority but the actions in themselves, committed by the entire government, were unconstitutional. They severely curtailed rights protected by the Constitution significantly reducing the limits on governmental power and infringing on the ideals of democracy which include freedom from governmental abuse of power. In ensuring national security, I do not think that the civil liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights need to be forfeited. Some sacrifices may be made in the name of protection, but a balance between the maintenance of national safety and the protection of rights would be best. Finding this balance is a difficult thing to accomplish as the stakes are very high on both sides and both safety and liberty are promised to the American people.

Concerning the status of citizens and resident aliens regarding their protected rights, the Constitution makes no distinction between the two. The rights of resident aliens should be protected equally to those of citizens as the Constitution cites the people and not the citizens alone when discussing those it was constructed to protect. I take this to mean all people living in the United States and would not discriminate on the basis of citizenship. For example, the case of Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) provides an interesting consideration. This case was brought in an effort to protect an American citizen of Japanese descent from the exclusion from his home in the internment camps of World War II which were created in an effort to avoid invasion by the Japanese. Among those removed from their homes were citizens and resident aliens alike, but all were selected on the basis of their ancestry. This action by the U.S. government was a violation of the Fourth Amendment guaranteeing the freedom from search and seizure and the Fourteenth Amendment granting equal protection under the Constitution but the court upheld the constitutionality of this action in an effort to protect national security. I disagree with this decision as it defies the underlying principle of equal protection as set forth in our Constitution.

If there is a need to curtail civil liberties belonging to those protected by the Constitution, it should only be done by Congress as specified in Article V with Amendments passed by 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of state legislatures. This is important in order to maintain checks and balances between the three branches of government, particularly against an abuse of executive power. An example of such is in the suspension of writs of habeas corpus as seen in Ex parte Merryman which was ruled unconstitutional because the ability to suspend a writ of habeas corpus does not belong to the president; only congress is allowed to perform this action as specified in Article 1 section 9 of the Constitution.

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 was not passed during a time of war. Restricting so many constitutionally protected rights not during war time opens the doors to the restriction of rights at any time the government feels it is necessary. This greatly threatens those civil liberties guaranteed under the Constitution and allows them to be undermined by the federal government. This is not something that I think should be allowed as it has the potential to be abused in a way that puts at risk the very people that are to be protected.

Moreover, if any individual rights are to be restricted by the government, it should not be done because they are dangerous to the public safety as it is more dangerous to invade these rights. At times, it may be helpful to suspend some personal liberties temporarily in order to more effectively protect national security but there are those civil liberties which should not be altered, namely those included in the Bill of Rights. These rights should be protected above all others because they are a part of the foundation of our country and have been valued and protected throughout our nation's history. If the civil liberties and rights enumerated in the Constitution are ever seen as dangerous, especially to the government whenever it feels threatened and not exclusively during times of war, then the nation is at risk of losing the core values on which it stands. For these reasons, I do not think that any rights protected under the Constitution are dangerous to national security.

Some examples of the measures that I think are appropriate to take in ensuring national safety include the escalation of security in airports and public places. In addition, I would advise against the usurpation of constitutionally protected rights including the freedom from search and seizure and the right to a fair, public, and speedy trial by jury with the assistance of Counsel (Amendments 4, 6, 7). With these considerations, the country may have been better protected not only against future attacks, but abuses of power by the federal government as well. I do not think that the government should be able to overlook other rights such as the protection from search and seizure, the freedom of speech (from having phone lines tapped), the freedom of assembly, the suspension of due process of law and a jury trial, or the right to a speedy and public trial. These are basic rights protected by the Bill of Rights and should not be altered except in very limited circumstances and done so only by the proper means and as previously discussed. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 was not the proper means for doing this although these are some of the rights on which it infringed in the name of national security.

In light of all the aforementioned considerations, there can be a distinction between the rights of the Native American terrorists who bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and those prisoners that are denied rights at Guantanamo. It is important to consider the nationality of those being held at Guantanamo, as aliens outside the United State have fewer, if any, constitutional rights than citizens of the United States, such as the aforementioned Native Americans. The majority of those being held at Guantanamo are not citizens of the United States and thus, as is currently argued and enacted by our government, do not have the privilege to the rights as enumerated by the Constitution. Additionally, because the prisoners are not being held on U.S. soil it can be argued that they are thus not subject to U.S. laws. These issues have been highly controversial in their interpretations, garnering enough attention for current review by the Supreme Court.",0,48.5,49.76,70.12,8919
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,You can't hurt me. I'm with the Union.,"It would be hard for Michiganders to select a single era to callthe good old days.It could be the 1940's, when the UAW negotiated terms that would pave the road for manufacturing workers nationwide to earn middle-class wages. The 50s, after the astoundingly productive Detroit assembly lines had supplied the armies that defeated fascism.Or even the 60s, when the population of Detroit had almost doubled within the last10 years.

Looking back, it'sdifficult to say which decade of burgeoning industry and unprecedented profit margins was our golden age. But there's one thing that's sure — it isn't this one.

As of the 21st century, the American auto industry is showing signs of a slow but sure collapse and the state is finding itself facing budgetary meltdown, a casualty of the much-vaunted globalized economy. Michigan is a particularly poignant example of the potential consequences of this new system, and it might just be the tip of the iceberg — vanquished are the stable, stodgy patriarchal companies like the Big Three,pervasive $20 an hour an hour wages1 and secure lifetime employment. In their place, a flexible, more competitive business ethic has left countless workers in the dust, and in turn, has jeopardized the middle class. There are benefits to the modernwork environment to be sure, just ask Japanese auto manufacturers. But, as we've seen, there are also costs. Right now, it's unclear whether or not Michigan will ever be able to make a comeback and it's even more doubtful that the state's myriad abandoned factories will ever be up and running again, and then there's the question of whether they should. Re-regulation, tax hikes and obscenely insular trade policy could conceivablytake us back to the Great Lakes State's gildeddays of yore, but this would require a serious reevaluation of our economic priorities— and in a sense, a break from Weber's inescapable iron cage. That is, our civic desire to reign resuscitate the money-losing Big Three conflicts with other desires, ones that Weber would deem more immediate —like the lust for increased innovation, robust stock portfolios and, well,Priuses. In America thus far, whether for good or ill, capitalism is getting the upper hand over our more labor-friendly regulatory impulses, though as the strain on working America mounts, it's anyone's guess how much longer that will last.

When it was first built, General Motors's auto manufacturing plant at Willow Run near Ypsilanti was called the Grand Canyon of mechanized America2, the eighth wonder of the world3, and something like the scene of a tragedy, 4— that was the socialist's response as Richard Sennett describes it in his book The Corrosion of Character. A colossal symbol of the success of democratically regulated capitalism, Willow Run was like a culmination of the old-world order5, immensely productive, devoid of any creativity or freedom of thought, and beautifully stable. Even though Sennett's socialist observer thought the routine of the assembly line was stifling, Willow Run and plants like it were also the site of worker's empowerment. Rigid rules about exact pay set the scene for the emergence of the nation's most powerful union, in whichemployees knew exactly where they stood. Without being nostalgic, Sennett described the essence of life on the assembly lines. Routine can demean, but it can also protect; routine can decompose labor, but it can also compose a life, 6. The soulless routine at Willow Run might have looked like a tragedy then, but after thousands of layoffs, it looks even more like a tragedy now.

There's a danger, of course, of over-romanticizing a flawed past. Aside from the burdensomeness of a regimented existence, there were other, larger flaws with the patriarchal system that kept Michigan afloat for so long. The dominance of the Big Three was the product of a sort of democratic capitalism that favored monolithic businesses, discouraged upstart companies andall but obliterated dramatic shifts in the market — for decades the Dow Jones Industrial Average had minor ups and downs, but stayed essentially level. That is, until around 1980, when democratic reigns on capitalism started to wear thin and the market shot skyward. Between 1973 and 2006 the gross domestic product tripled and productivity increased by an estimated 80 percent7. The decline of the American worker also coincided with unprecedented growth and prosperity, making it difficult for Sennett to easily compare the two.

In drawing this picture I am well aware it risks, despite all qualifications, appearing as a contrast between before, which was better, and now, which is worse. None of us could desire to return to the security of Enrico's or the Greek baker's generation. It was claustrophobic in outlook; its terms of self-organization were rigid. In a longer-term view, while the achievement of personal security has served a profound practical as well as psychological need in modern capitalism, that achievement carried a high price. A deadening politics of seniority and time entitlements ruled the unionized workers at Willow Run; to continue that mind-set today would be a recipe for self-destruction in today's markets and flexible networks. The problem we confront is how to organize our life histories now, in a capitalism which disposes us to drift. 8

Sennett clearly illustrates the tensions between the middle-class mainstays like compensation for seniority and entitlements and the all-consuming capitalist ethos, and in doing so, he also highlights another, larger, struggle — democracy vs. capitalism. As tempting as it is to reminisce about the good old days, burdensome government regulation and suffocating routines dampen productivity and progress. As any Republican will tell you, a strong government is at odds with successful business; strict regulation, high taxation, careful oversight — all pitted against corporate interest. The flip side of this is that these regulations also play a critical role in protecting the typical worker. The result is what economist Robert Reich characterizes in his book Supercapitalism as a sort of battle between ourselves as consumers and ourselves as citizens. There is atension between the impulse to boycott and the impulse to buy. For example, while many of us know that buying Tropicana is a little bit like drinking someone else's misery for breakfast, 9 it's still cheap and it tastes great. Given the success of the Tropicana label (or Wal-Mart or Nike or anything labeled made in China), it's clear that our consumerism is drowning out our voices workers.

Those voices are still audible in America, though. Unless, that is, you live in Saipan. Without enforced labor laws or formidable government oversight, the Saipan John Bowe describes in his book Nobodies is the perfect example of what might happen if capitalism ever completely won the battle against government regulation. Bowe wasn't the only one to see this. As the island was developing, some business-friendly officials thought it might be the perfect opportunity to prove to the liberals that a rising tide really does lift all boats, and the way to raise the tide is to stand aside and let the corporations make money.

(Saipan), (Congressman Tom Delay) said, was ‘just what conservatives have always wanted, which is enterprise zones — tax free, regulation-free zones where with the right motivation, great industry could take place and spill out into the general communities. 10

And spill out it did. The entire island became a regulation-free zone, complete with strip clubs, prostitution and rampant corruption — in short, as Bowe describes it, a new-age Wild West. This seemingly perfect experiment in capitalism reveals what are perhaps the more sinister tendencies of the market. Left to their own devices, companies tend to pursue whatever business practices lend them the greatest edge over the competition and that allow them the greatest profit margin. In Saipan, that was the ultimate degradation of the worker — slavery. Bowe paints this as a fundamental flaw in human nature, but instead, it might just be a fundamental characteristic of a healthy company. Now that the megalithic corporations of yesterday have largely faded into the past, human interest is in really in their repertoire of a normal business. Sennett found it dismaying that Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, couldn't spare any of his money, writing that By all accounts he is a ruthless competitor, and the evidence of his greed is a matter of public record … he has the ability to let go, but not give. 11 Of course, Sennett wrote that before the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation became one of the world's foremost charities. But perhaps it's significant that only after Gates had mostly given up the day to day running of Microsoft — the epitome of a new-age upstart company — that he started giving to the needy. It might be an indication that it's not the baseness of human nature, as Bowe suggested, that keeps companies from being benevolent. In retirement, Gates turns out to be a pretty good guy. So instead, maybe it's an indication that, without regulation, the nature of capitalism itself is disposed toward ruthless competition and greed, no matter how nice the business leaders are outside the office.

So then the question is, can a system that is dependent on but also at odds with the working population survive? Neither Sennett nor Bowe think so. Sennett foresees that the regime which provides human beings no deep reasons to care about one another cannot long preserve its legitimacy. 12 And Bowe takes that prediction to its logical conclusion: The issue will then become one of self-preservation more than justice. Never mind the question 'Are you fine with your comfort relying on the misery of billions?' The question would be 'Do you want them to come kill you?' 13Despite Bowe's ringing warning, no one espouses the idea that an abusive system will naturally fall quite as fervently as Marx. In a world that looks like it has the potential to become more and more like Saipan, for Marx it's actually inching closer toward a proletariat revolution.

The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own gravediggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable, (Marx).14

The fall of the proletariat, perhapsalready apparent labor in conditions like the ones in developing countries or even in the American places Bowe describes, is only the first step toward the eventual victory of the proletariat. Whether they actually consider themselves Marxist or not, both Bowe and Sennett use his logic: Eventually class struggle will get so bad that it has to get better. It seems that as the upper 10 percent of the population gradually ends up owning a greater and greater percentage of the wealth, we're truly creating a system that isn't sustainable. There are other ways out that revolution though. As Bowe points out, the last time income disparity had grown to such monumental proportions there was a Depression. Though there was never a revolution, heavy-handed government regulation finally managed to revolutionize the existing system to protect workers and the poor. Will it take a depression or a revolution before that happens again?

Let's hope not. The recipe for revolution might actually be more complicated in America today than Marx, Bowe and even Sennett think it is. In his book Status Anxiety, Alain de Botton gives a compelling account of how decreased government regulation increases anxiety for workers, which is in many cases just as painful as relative poverty. But this anxiety is manifest in other ways than rebellion against the bourgeoisie. Instead, de Botton is in favor of putting one's status into perspective by looking at great art, or reading Jane Austin.15 In other words, as he put it in a Op-Ed in The New York Times, Workers of the World, Relax. 16 Though this might seem like ludicrous proposal in light of the huge changes that would be necessary to enact meaningful change for the working class, de Botton does give real reasons why a large-scale revolution in today's flexible work world is unlikely to carry the moral punch that it did in Marx's time. He describes the three stories that gave the poor the moral high ground, including Marx's victimization narrative, and then three more stories that seem unfortunately familiar today — all with the message that low status was not merely regrettable, but also deserved. 17 These stories, praising a gung-ho American up-by-the-bootstraps mentality, have served to undermine the moral authority of the people whose bootstraps proved defective.The result is that to the injury of poverty, a meritocratic system now added the insult of shame. 18 This is especially important because shame is a very bad word to associate with a military movement, especially a revolution. As long as the working classes remain convinced that they really are living in meritocracy, and are therefore willing to accept the idea that they're responsible for their own misfortune, uprising seems unlikely. Instead, we can expect self-help books to continue selling well.

Revolution isn't the only path to reform, of course. Bowe proposes another alternative — boycotts and consumer-driven actions against offending companies. For Bowe, it's hard to fathom why, in light of such terrible offenses as slavery on American soil, people seem content to sit back and do nothing. Here Bowe falls into the dangerous position of laying a good chunk of blame on the consumer, but what he fails to realize is that the consumers are doing exactly what they're supposed to do in the current system — buy the cheapest, high quality products. It's unrealistic to blame the average American, with limited information about the products he's buying and rent to pay, he's only playing his required role in a capitalist system. Capitalism is functioning exactly as it's supposed to, the real fault likes with government, whose responsibility it is to keep corporate interest in check. In the struggle between democracy and capitalism identified by Reich, the burden falls on democracy to ensure scales of the balance of power aren't tipped too far in either direction. So while doesn't make sense to blame the consumer, but might make sense to blame the citizen. Calling for capitalism to reign in its capitalist tendencies is untenable, democracy should be doing that for us. As citizens of a democracy, that's what we should be doing that on our own.

That said, what is it exactly that we as citizens should be calling for? Do we want a return to the not quite golden age 19 of democratic capitalism? The deadening politics of seniority and time entitlements Sennett described? De Botton's comforting world of patriarchal rigidity? Bowe seems to think so.

When free-trade enthusiasts mention that x million Chinese and y million Indians and anyone else from poor countries have been ""lifted"" out of poverty, what is seldom addressed is that they have been forced to join the world economy against their will. No one ever asked them if they wanted to sign up. … Prior to their joining the modern world and the global economy, most had lived on small subsistence farms, growing the bulk of the food they needed, earning precious little hard cash but staying alive and self-sufficient. 20

This argument, that poor people were probably happier while subsistence farming, is fallacious. In his romanticizing about the pre-capitalist system (the same one Max Weber seems slightly nostalgic for) Bowe fails to realize that there's a reason that people are voluntarily leaving these not-so idyllic farms and giving away all their money for the chance to go to the United States and work. Bowe is underestimating the benefits of the booming global economy. Scoffing that x million people were lifted out of poverty, he ignores how terribly important that is. Go live in their huts, he bids the elitist American consumers. Sniff some glue and pray with them. … And then come back and let's talk about freedom. 21 When I spent 5 weeks in India a few years ago, I did stay in a hut with a poor family for a while. I prayed with them (glue was not their drug of choice). I talked with the children about their dreams to become engineers, Bollywood stars and cartoonists. Not one of them dreamed of a life of subsistence farming. In wishing for a return to the pre-globalized economy, Bowe is falling into his own kind of out-of-touch elitism — the kind that thinks farming is more romantic, and therefore more desirable than a job in a textile mill. But as terrible as the word sweatshop might seem, in lots of developing countries, they call it something else the best job in town. There's a reason people in poor countries are anxious to get work in factories. Industrial jobs are providing people with a stepping-stone out of a dead-end existence, and giving their children a shot to acquire a lifestyle that was unimaginable before. As flawed as this new developing economy is, lifting millions of people out of poverty really is a pretty good thing.

Saying that the new economy is great, however, obviously glosses over its serious problems. But instead of talking about thwarting it or reversing it, we should instead talk about regulating it. As consumers, our pocket books do a good job of communicating what we want out of capitalism, now, as citizens we have to do a better job communicating what we want out of democracy. In a state like Michigan, it's impossible not to perceive the plight of the American worker, but the answer probably isn't sabotaging Toyota, or even the forces of globalization that brought it to a dealership near you. A better solution would be to call for increased government regulation, here and abroad, aimed at helping the worker as much as possible without destroying the company. While it's easy enough to say, it would mean making a break from the iron cage in the interest of worker's rights, and putting our civic interests above our economic ones — clearly a difficult feat. Still, as the strain on working America mounts, even if there's not a revolution, the concerns of and about the working classes will become more pressing. Eventually, when public officials owe their seats to entirely the votes of the disgruntled working class, perhaps worker-friendly regulation will finally become a priority.

Too bad Michigan's delegates won't be seated.",0,22.38,9.05,6.72,18647
Political Science,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,"""Safer, Stronger"" … is it?","I am George W. Bush, and I approve this message. Unlike most other political ads put out by candidates running for presidential elections, this is how the Safer, Stronger ad began its 30 seconds spot, which first aired on March 3rd, 2004. Obviously, just as the beginning line suggests, this is an ad by then-incumbent candidate, president of the United States campaigning for the 2004 presidential election that was so heavily contested. At the first time viewing the spot, I could not clearly figure out whether it was a candidate-positive ad or a negative attack ad put out by his opponents, even though I had found the ad from the Republican side of the 2004 presidential contest. Certain features of the ad, especially in the first half, such as negative images of American economy, stock market falling bright red, and struggling to rebuild the nation after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, were presented that could have misled many viewers. Not only were the presented images depressing and gloomy, the overall tone of the color of the spot was also bleak and murky. Even at the very last part of the ad, when the Americans were supposed to have turned the corner, as the caption had suggested, even though the sounds in the background definitely carried positive images, presenting giggling kids running around playing joyfully, sound of welding, which indicates rejuvenated and now bursting economy, and the sound of jet fighter, indicating strong defense and national security against our enemies, the visual images almost told a different story, buried in the heavy tone of the background color of darkness.

That is why I had decided, immediately to analyze this particular political ad, just as Professor Bucy had suggested, by viewing it without the background sound. With all the sounds muted, as I had suspected, this spot almost seemed as a negative ad against the incumbent candidate put out by the Kerry campaign. With all the background sounds and hope-inducing music excluded from the sensory system, first half of the ad appeared to be an attack ad against the President. After showing the clip of President George W. Bush taking oath, with his left hand on the Bible, and his right hand up in the air, for the inauguration ceremonies, the next clip the viewers find themselves in looking at the gloomy messages of an economy in recession, with so many big bright red arrows pointing down, definitely pointing to a stock market in decline. A man is seen shaking his head, unbelievably at what is happening with the American economy. With the caption A dot come boom… gone bust, it almost seemed like a lack of imagination to express what they had intended to appeal through this ad to the audiences, who are potential voters and possibly potential supporters to his cause, on Bush campaigners' part, when the ad showed http://www... being typed in. I thought showing these images clearly indicating to bad economy was not a sound plan for the President's campaign since it could raise a question that could serious hurt the incumbent candidate's position: Who is responsible for this mess? Obviously, he was the President of the United States of America for the past couple years. Apparent from the fact that the ad started with the January 2001 inauguration of President Bush, the Bush campaigned seemed to want to establish the incumbent-style ad that presented him as the only person who is fit to lead the country in time of economy in recession. But his political advisers also should have remembered that, it could have backfired on his cause and haunted him, a candidate-positive ad put out by him, blaming himself for the worsened economy, while he was in the position to lead the nation away from it.

As if it was not bad enough, in the next scene, the ad took the audiences back to the day of tragedy with showing the images of September 11, rubbles from the buildings that had been hit by the terrorist activities, and firefighters continuing on with the search and rescue efforts, while American people are mourning the national tragedy and raising up the American flag, the icon of American freedom and people's patriotic allegiance to the nation in distress. Showing of these images of vulnerable America, attacked by terrorists and deeply scarred could almost seem ironic with the title of this ad: Safer, Stronger.

In Chapter 8 of Going Dirty, David Mark gives examples of various levels of candidates, ranging from local mayoral candidates to presidential candidates, appealing to the emotions, related to nation's experience of September 11. Even though, most of these ads were part of negative campaigning, resting on the politics of fear, as the chapter's title had suggested, it was not the case with this particular political ad that I had chose to analyze. The incumbent president's campaign had tried to appeal to the voters that Bush is more apt at fighting terrorism and building safer nation against our enemies by establishing stronger defense and national system, and stayed away from naming Kerry as incapable of doing so, or at least, not as fit as President Bush, as other negative ads of the 2004 contest had claimed.

In Chapter 6 of Media Politics, Iyengar and McGrady talk about the issue ownership when candidates campaign for public positions. The authors give examples of owned-issues by the Republican Party, and they include: national security, defense, and foreign affairs. (p. 142, Iyengar & McGrady) Safer, Stronger ad aired by the Bush campaign, yet again, tries to claim the issues owned by their party. Two main things the Bush campaign had tried to boast as their advantages against their opponent were, fiscally conservative, indicating that he can bring back to life the economy in recession, and build stronger nation by focusing on national security and defense.

Also the Bush campaign had tried hard to present their candidate as a strong, well-established candidate. This ad tried to put out the incumbent style of campaigning by starting out with the inauguration ceremonies: I, Gorge Walker Bush, solemnly swear… Whenever the President is shown in the clip, he is wearing suit and tie in a very formal fashion, and showing what he had tried to do to establish safer and sounder economy and stronger national security and defense. As suggested in lecture, the incumbent rarely speaks directly to the audience, except for the part where he or she claims responsibility, after the passage of a new requirement enacted through the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA). BCRA requires candidates, parties and interest groups to include both an oral and written disclaimer statement with radio and television ads, thereby taking responsibility for the content of the political advertisement. Even so, in this particular ad, President Bush did not talk directly to the audiences, rather walking erectly towards the camera, while the voice-over of himself approved the message. Also, with his incumbent-style of campaigning, he appealed to the people to support the steady leadership.

This particular political spot tried very hard to establish strong association with the candidate it supported with the American flag. Just as West had suggested in the Overview of Ads article, the American flag is a strong symbol of patriotism. (West, p. 6) In the post-9/11 world, the appeal to American flag and patriotism associated with the most American symbol, swayed across the nation. Riding on the current, this ad presented the American flag five times in a seemingly short spot of 30 seconds. The ad begins with the American flag in the background while President Bush took the oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Then there is a flag standing firmly flying high in the sky, in front of the rubbles of fallen buildings from the terrorist attacks, indicating even though our enemies had managed to destroy the buildings, the American ideal did not fall and remained to stand firm against the vicious world out there. The next scene when the American flag is found is when the firefighters carry the victims of the attack, wrapped around the flag. This image is juxtaposed by a private citizen raising the flag. Then just as the ad began with the flag in the background, the spot ended with the flag at the last scene, in the background of the candidate's name.

Overall, I was not able to find any condensation symbols that were buried in the messages of this particular political ad, and also I could not grasp any ethically suspect editing or production techniques. From the beginning to the end, most of the images and clips put on were presented without much editing and I believe that is what the Bush campaign had tried to establish. Through candidly speaking to the viewers, even though there were hardships that the American nation faced, the message of the ad was to urge people to rise to the challenge with steady leadership in times of change. One thing that caught my eyes was that, it seemed very interesting that the ad tried to evoke the image of change. With all the incumbent-style of campaigning he had tried to establish up to that point, I do not think change was not such a good choice of word use, or a concept that he should have appealed to, since it could suggest changing the presidency. Also, with overall gloomy and depressing contents, accompanied with dark tone the images were presented with, I do not think that this particular ad would have helped the candidate's cause very much.",0,0,0,0,9541
Political Science,Proposal,Undergraduate,Introduction/Lit Review/Research Design,"Introduction
In my research, I will be attempting to answer the following question: what impact, if any, did the rise of political activity on the Internet have on Democratic victories in the midterm elections of 2006? And, if it did, how can this impact be understood in terms of new means of political participation? In the objective analysis of the election, I will be focusing on the impact of left-wing political websites in fundraising and voter mobilization in various Senate and House races. In my explanation of this potential phenomenon, I will attempt to understand political participation over the Internet in terms of three major concepts: individually-motivated participation, externally-motivated participation, and modern developments in information dissemination and participation (social epidemiology, participatory and collaborative websites, etc.).

Few could doubt the rising impact of the Internet on all aspects of our lives. It makes sense then, that the realm of politics is not exempt from this transformation. Over the past few election cycles, a class of political websites, or blogs, has emerged as a powerful force in American politics. Through fundraising and ground work, Daily Kos, the pre-eminent left-wing political blog, single-handedly guided an unknown, Ned Lamont, to a victory over the incumbent, Sen. Joe Lieberman, in the Connecticut Democratic primary. The list of successful candidates who found their start on Daily Kos includes Senators Jon Tester and Jim Webb, and Representatives Tim Walz, Jerry McNerney, and Joe Sestak, among others. Were the Netroots, the left-wing blogosphere, the driving movement behind the Democratic resurgence of 2006, or were they simply in the right place at the right time? The answer to this question will likely enlighten us to the future role of the Internet in politics. The nature of this role will dictate change on a number of fronts in American electoral politics: common qualities of successful candidates, strategies and effectiveness of political campaigns, accountability of politicians (both within their local constituency and to the national party), and regulatory campaign law. Thus, my inquiry addresses the future of politics in the light of new technological development. As communication grows ever faster and more comprehensive, the American political system will undergo great change. An examination of our most recent elections may shed some light on how that great change will manifest itself.

Review of the Literature
There has been some scholarship on the Internet and its effect on political participation, but little has been written specifically about the effect of blogs. As these blogs grow in influence and number, it will become increasingly necessary to account for their existence in any comprehensive examination of political participation. Assessing their current level of influence and investigating how they fit into the larger context of political participation literature is a good and necessary first step in incorporating them fully into our academic understanding of politics.

In this review, I will begin by summarizing the classical view of political participation, without reference to the impact of the Internet. Next, I will examine the more recent scholarship on the impact of the Internet on participation theory, in particular examining the radically changed cost/benefit model for individual participation and the potential for change in direct and indirect mobilization. I will also attempt to reconcile the work of one particular thinker, Malcolm Gladwell, with both traditional participation theory and newer models of participation. Finally, I will assess where my research may fit in the larger context of scholarship on the topics of participation and politics on the Internet.

I. Political Participation
Scholarship in the field of participation has a fairly singular focus. Why do people participate in politics, when do they do it, and how do they do so? Literature on the subject tends to begin with a distinction between individually-motivated political participation and externally-motivated political participation. In general, individually-motivated political participation falls under the category of why people participate. It identifies certain characteristics or tendencies that lend themselves to political participation. On the other hand, externally-motivated participation tends to fall under the category of when people participate and how they do so. The ways in which individuals are approached to participate politically go a long way to defining when they will do it and how they will do so.

Examinations of individually-motivated political participation focus on those personal characteristics that might make one more or less likely to participate in politics. These characteristics include personality traits, such as a sense of citizenship, specific circumstances, such as strong identification with a candidate, and cultural or socioeconomic labels, such as ethnicity or income level. Additionally, an individual-level approach to participation may be seen through the lens of a cost/benefit analysis. As suggested by Rosenstone and Hansen, individuals generally participate when the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs.1 Clearly, however, the context for participation is quite important, as the level of participation varies despite the relative consistency of the personal characteristics of the potential participants.

Thus, examinations of external motivations for political participation are crucial in aiding our understanding of when those people who are primed for participation by the aforementioned characteristics do actually act, and in what context they do so. Examinations of political mobilization, defined as the process by which candidates, parties, activists, and groups induce other people to participate, focus on ascertaining who is targeted by mobilization efforts and when mobilization efforts occur.2 Scholars tend to view externally-motivated participation as the product of political strategy. The specific targets and the timing of the targeting reflect an attempt by the political actor to most efficiently generate political action toward its desired end. Thus, political actors attempting to induce participation may engage in rational prospecting, a process by which recruiters seek individuals with characteristics that predispose them to political activity. 3

Without doubt, individual and external motivations for political participation are inextricably linked. A group of individuals may be ripe for participation, but without the proper prompting from an outside source, they may never realize this potential. On the other hand, political mobilization strategies rely heavily on understanding the conditions necessary for individual participation. Much of the debate in participation scholarship, then, is focused on how to weigh these two major factors. Jack Nagel, for example, suggests that people initiate little of what we normally call participation . . . Acts of participation are stimulated by elites—if not by the government, then by parties, interest groups, agitators, and organizers. 4 The authors of Voice and Equality, on the other hand, suggest that the two main factors in likelihood of participation are the motivation and the capacity to take part in political life, with networks of recruitment mentioned later as a third, minor factor.5 Different interpretations of this interaction between internal and external factors are not entirely at odds. Instead, they reflect a diversity of focus, which ultimately fleshes out the body of scholarship rather than attempting to refute or rebut what has been written from a different perspective.

II. Costs and Benefits
An important aspect of participation theory is the examination of an individual's cost/benefit analysis. The costs of participation are diverse, described as some combination of money, time, skill, knowledge, and self-confidence. 6 For example, volunteering on a campaign takes the time to perform the job, the money lost by working without pay, the skill necessary to be an effective volunteer, the knowledge to choose who to volunteer for, and the self-confidence to follow through on volunteering. Each of these costs has traditionally meant that political participation is an easier and more likely choice for those of higher income, education, and socioeconomic status. This generalization is not only a logical conclusion but is also statistically confirmed by Verba and Nie.7 Those with an abundance of wealth can withstand the financial cost of participation with little to no effect. The highly educated have an abundance of skill, knowledge, and self-confidence from years of instruction in the field of politics and the virtues of civic participation. These two qualities (wealth and education) are fairly good predictors of socio-economic status, further reinforcing the inequities inherent in political participation.

The thinking on the benefits of participation is fairly simple and straightforward. Though there are numerous classifications for the types of benefits received (such as James Wilson's categorization of material, solidary and purposive benefits8), there is a strong underlying definition to the types of benefits that induce political participation. Individuals tend to participate when they have more at stake in politics—because policies affect them more, politicians draw them in, options appeal to them more, or duty calls them more. 9 Potential for benefits can only be a compelling reason to participate if those benefits have a clear and direct effect on the individual in question. An organization backing a particular issue will likely find its constituents and participants to be those directly affected by the issue, or those who have such a strong psychological connection the issue that its realization has a very clear and direct benefit to them. This understanding of benefits is fairly intuitive and is met with little, if any, debate or dispute.

The Internet presents a serious challenge to accepted theories of political participation. By dramatically reducing the costs of political action, the Internet may have rendered notions of participation which rely on an individual weighing costs and benefits outdated. Financial costs to participation have been diminished in a number of significant ways. Firstly, the system of political donations has been somewhat democratized. Online donation sites have eased transaction costs and broadened the scope of available candidates, and campaign finance reform has placed a greater emphasis on small donations. Secondly, blogs provide open and free access to political information and discussion, weakening the skill and knowledge advantage of the highly educated. Thus, the costs of individually-motivated political participation have been radically reduced by the free and open nature of political content on the Internet. This development likely has a significant impact on the type of person who participates. As little has been written on the topic, it is a hole in the literature that I would like to fill.

III. The When of Political Participation – Mobilization
An understanding of the individual's cost/benefit analysis is crucial to the traditional mobilization strategies of politicians, parties, or interest groups. As noted earlier, mobilization is an attempt by an external actor to induce political participation in a group or individual. Mobilization can be further subdivided into direct mobilization and indirect mobilization. Direct mobilization previously served a similar function to what the Internet does today, diminishing costs to participation by driving voters to the polls, supplying information, or generally easing the process of participation.10 Indirect mobilization is not the opposite of direct mobilization, rather it is a means of spreading the effects of direct mobilization. Indirect mobilization utilizes social networks to encourage participation. An example would be a politician contacting the leader of the union and offering benefits or diminishing costs in exchange for the support of his organization, a strong social network. The strength of social networks maintains the benefits of direct mobilization while providing further encouragement to participation through social pressures.

Given that mobilization generally lowers costs to participation and increases benefits, one might assume that it also serves to democratize political participation. The reality is quite the opposite. Scholarship from the pre-Internet era consistently found that rather than encouraging politically disengaged individuals, mobilization efforts disproportionately reach the politically engaged, the civically skilled, and the socioeconomically advantaged. 11 The process of rational prospecting results in a disproportionately educated, wealthy, and politically inclined pool of mobilization targets. This serves to further reinforce, rather than combat, the inequality that results from individually-motivated participation.

Can the Internet, that great democratizer, change this fact? There has been some work done on the subject, the most relevant work being Brian Krueger's. Krueger examined the online mobilization done by politicians and organizations and found, contrary to his initial assumptions, that Although most of the long-standing determinants of offline political mobilization fail to predict online mobilization, political interest and Internet skills powerfully determine online mobilization [and] . . . because socioeconomic status, civic skills, and political interest directly predict online skills, these factors indirectly influence the likelihood of online mobilization. 12 Krueger, however, only examined online mobilization that operates through e-mail lists, the variability of which played a large role in his findings. My first instinct would be that pleas for donation or participation sent through massive e-mail lists would account for a fairly small percentage of the full mobilization done on the Internet. There has been no research done on the ability of websites to directly and indirectly mobilize through the content posted on their website, rather than that sent to e-mail inboxes. The question of the Internet's effect on mobilization, then, remains quite open to debate and investigation.

IV. Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen
In his popular and influential work The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell proposes a new model for the dissemination of information and the process of convincing people to participate, whether that participation is buying a certain type of shoe, refraining from committing a crime in a crowded city, or, perhaps, political action. In fleshing out his theory, Gladwell suggests there are three types of people primarily responsible for the spread of an idea or action: connectors, mavens, and salesmen. Connectors are people with unusually large social circles, capable of spreading information by virtue of their large number of acquaintances. Mavens are individuals with an uncommon level of knowledge of any given topic, predisposed to distribute this high level of information to their own social circle. Finally, salesmen are those with the ability to influence others, exerting influence over their peers on the strength of their own charisma.13

Gladwell's modeling of social interactions bears a strong resemblance to two classic aspects of political participation literature. The first is the concept of rational prospecting. Political mobilizers seek a certain type of individual in their recruitment efforts. One common type is the individual who is centrally positioned in social networks. 14 This description immediately calls to mind Gladwell's connectors, who use their central position in large-scale social networks to disseminate information many times more effectively than does the average person. The second is the concept of social networks as a key factor in the dissemination of information and the actualization of political participation. Political information is conveyed not only through speeches and media reports but also through a variety of informal social mechanisms. 15 Given the primacy of these informal social interactions over formal political mobilization in an individual's life, political behavior may be understood in terms of individuals tied together by, and located within, networks, groups, and other social formations that largely determine their opportunities for the exchange of political information. 16 This understanding of political behavior fits quite nicely with Gladwell's understanding of social interaction. In Gladwell's model, the products we buy, the songs we listen to, and the mannerisms we adopt can often be traced back to our social network, dominated by connectors, mavens, and salesmen. In Huckfeldt and Sprague's model of political behavior, political participation must be understood in the context of social networks, which exert great influence over the degree, type, and timing of participation in politics. The similarities are striking.

There has been no scholarship on the specific topic of Gladwell's thinking as applied to political participation. This is a gap in the literature that I hope to fill. How, then, can Gladwell's thinking be applied to the effect of the blogosphere on political participation in 2006? Bloggers can be seen as connectors, mavens, and salesmen. As connectors, they can use the huge network of their personal blog and the greater blogosphere to disseminate information (a good example is Markos Moultisas of DailyKos). As mavens, bloggers can use their specific expertise to spotlight a specific issue or call attention to the mainstream media's informational failings (a good example would be Brad DeLong, an expert in the field of economics). As salesmen, bloggers can use their position and writing ability to sell their audience on a specific candidate, issue, or action (a good example is the group of Connecticut bloggers who sold the DailyKos community on a primary challenge to Senator Joe Lieberman, and specifically on future candidate Ned Lamont). Viewing the blogosphere in these terms may shed light on its seeming ability to change minds, affect change, and remodel the political landscape.

V. The Modern Internet
The existing literature sheds light on important aspects of political participation and provides the framework for how I will approach my research. However, the game has undoubtedly changed significantly. Easy and cheap access to the Internet, and to blogs specifically, undermines previous theories that rely on notions of cost and benefit, as the costs to political participation have been radically downsized. The openness of the blogosphere may also serve to democratize the mobilization strategies of political actors. My thesis will investigate if these reduced barriers to participation have changed the nature of who participates and when they do so, or if it has changed how people participate in politics. Another important aspect of my research will be the apparent gap in fundraising by the right-wing and left-wing blogospheres, respectively. Given that advantages in fundraising have traditionally favored Republicans, it seems likely that there has been some significant change in the sources of individually-motivated participation, externally-motivated participation, or, perhaps, both.

There has been surprisingly little work done on the impact of the Internet, and much of the work done is focused on the structure of the Internet as of 1998 or 2002. In recent years, a notion has developed that was coined Web 2.0 by Internet entrepreneur Tim O'Reilly. The Web 2.0 idea suggests that the Internet has undergone a significant change from its initial composition, shifting from top-down information dissemination to interactive, collaborative compilation of information. Instead of Encyclopedia Britannica, we now have Wikipedia. Instead of mp3.com, we now have interactive, file-sharing programs like Limewire.17 Interactive blogs, like DailyKos, are sterling examples of this new development. Where heads of powerful interest groups and Washington insiders once controlled the national dialogue, we now find the open forum of the blogosphere. Where wealthy donors once dominated the landscape, we now find the financial clout of ActBlue.com. This shift from the World Wide Web of the 1990s to the Web 2.0 of 2007 is one that has been largely ignored in political science literature, despite its undeniable relevance to the practice of modern politics. This gap is where my research will hopefully fit, examining the impact of this significant shift on the process of political participation and the outcomes of our elections.",0,27.73,37.23,13.96,20866
Political Science,Proposal,Undergraduate,"The Electoral Micro-Macroeconomic Cycle: Taking Tufte to the State Level
","Introduction
Citizens of democratic governments wield a tool by which they can send a signal to their elected officials. Through voting these citizens can reward elected officials by reelecting them into office, or they may also signal discontent and vote them out of office. This accountability mechanism places emphasis on the performance their representatives. As a result, the politician should respond by attempting to enhance performance, or at least enhance perceived performance in order to win the election. A way to achieve this end is through the provision of public goods. One such public good includes favorable macroeconomic conditions. For example, the president of the United States has the available instruments, like transfer payments, public spending, and tax policies, to try to influence the economy in a positive direction. If he or she can successfully stimulate economic conditions, voters will likely reward the incumbent for their performance.

With that said, attempts to stimulate the economy to capture votes should increase in the months leading up to an election. Scholars and academics have explored this idea and have actually observed this trend of pre-election economic expansions (Tufte 1978; Nordhaus 1975), labeling it the political business cycle. Edward Tufte found a pronounced relationship between presidential election cycles and economic boosts. This is an interesting model that can be pushed further empirically.

In March 2006, Jennifer Granholm the governor of Michigan signed into law an increase in the minimum wage. This legislation was set to take effect October 2006, exactly a month before the gubernatorial election. It could have been altruistic, but the timing is suspect. It is my conjecture that other governors engage in the same sort of opportunistic behavior. Governors have the same incentives as presidents, and Tutfe's political business cycle model should extend empirically onto these sub-national elections.

Literature Review
First, it would be prudent to consider the academic literature on the political business cycle. Scholars have continuously revisited the topic since it was first posited in the 1970s. One of the early pioneers of this theory was Edward Tufte, as mentioned before. In his seminal work Political Control of the Economy, Tufte found that out of 27 democratic countries, 19 showed evidence for an electoral-economic cycle (1978). This meant that 19 of 27 countries showed economic acceleration in the months leading up to the election. The United States, in particular, exhibited increased short-run growth in the run up to elections as opposed to drop down in the non-election years for the majority of post-WWII presidencies (Tufte 1978).

As time went on, an alternative theory arose; some academics moved towards the partisan theory. Unlike the political business cycle, the partisan theory suggests that different parties will implement policies that appease to their base constituencies. Parties of the left often represent the working class. Thus, they will pursue policies that decrease unemployment since effects of unemployment fall disproportionately on lower income workers (Hibbs 1987). Parties on the right, on the other hand, tend to minimize inflation, because they typically represent the upper income populace.

More support for the political business cycle came in 1995. Improving on the model Kenneth Schultz (1995) observed a pronounced, and at times sizable, trend of expansionary policies in the pre-election months. His improvement included controlling for the political incentives to manipulate at election time, which previous works did not take into account. As a result previous studies displayed a higher level of variance in the data supporting this model; however, controlling this variable revealed robust evidence in favor of Tufte's theory (Schultz 1995).

Douglas Hibbs, a proponent of the partisan theory, even admits to empirical evidence in favor of the political business cycle. He stated that the Reagan administration was a textbook illustration of the political business cycle (Hibbs 1987). The two years preceding the election experienced an unprecedented growth in real disposable income and low unemployment. Hibbs conceded that the Nixonian heaping of social security checks just days preceding the election was also clear evidence in support of the political business cycle. Hibbs then goes on to say that none of the assumptions underlying the model is implausible.

These assumptions are consistent throughout the literature, and because of their importance, they are worth addressing. They also allow Tufte's political business cycle theory to map onto sub-national elections empirically. The first assumption is that politicians seek reelection, and an expanding economy prior to the election will increase votes (Tufte 1978). Assuming politicians seek reelection is a very plausible and reasonable assumption. The incumbent is presented with a choice between holding onto their job and losing it. If rational (meaning the benefits of keeping the job are greater than the costs), the incumbent would prefer to keep his or her job. If not, they would not be seeking reelection in the first place, unless the derived benefit from election process trumps the benefit from holding the office itself.

The second part of the first assumption reasons that favorable economic conditions prior to the election will increase ballots cast for the incumbent. This is realistic when evaluating previous literature and empirical studies on voting behavior. When people go to the polls to vote, a myriad of studies have shown them to be retrospective, instead of prospective (forward looking) (Tufte 1975; Fiorina 1981; Kinder and Kiewiet 1979; and Abramowitz et al. 1988). This suggests voters assess candidates based on economic prosperity before the election. If they feel as though they are better off, they reward the incumbent. To summarize, voters prefer candidates whom they expect, based on the incumbent's previous track record, will deliver them greater material well-being, perhaps through better aggregate economic performance. Thus, incumbents have powerful incentives to improve voters' economic fortunes. (Franzese 2002)

Now that the incumbent's motive (Tufte 1978) and the voter's preferences have been established as sound assumptions, it is appropriate to discuss the last assumption. This assumption relies on the government's, mainly the incumbent's, ability to affect macroeconomic outcomes given the institutional constraints of a democracy. The executive branch, the president's administration, has a lot of tools at its disposal to try to positively affect the macroeconomy.

One, the president gives the budget to Congress through executive communication. He or she can increase spending during the election year to help stimulate the desired effect. The president can also speed up the bureaucracy to distribute transfer payments right before the election (as in the case of Nixon). Increasing the amount of transfer payments to individuals is another tool the president can take advantage of with the approval of the legislature. Nixon increased social security benefits to stay in line with inflation prior to the election period. Lastly, the president may appoint the chairman of the federal reserve. The president cannot conduct monetary policy, but appointing a chairman with similar beliefs is beneficial to achieving the president's policy goals.

Empirical Application
Having stated the former, Tufte's political business cycle should be observed on the sub-federal level. Economic expansions should be evident on a state level preceding gubernatorial elections. Governors, like presidents, have the motive to expand their local economies.

One study reinforcing similar incentives for governors and presidents found that presidential voting and gubernatorial to be exclusive. Political Scientists Atkeson and Partin (1995) study showed that when evaluating a governor, the voter is retrospective in judging the governor's performance. The voters cast ballots based on their view of the state's economic condition, independent of the national economic condition. As the chief executive, the governor is seen as responsible for state economic fortune or woes. Their study furnished no evidence in support of the national referendum hypothesis (Atkeson and Partin 1995), or the idea that the gubernatorial election to be a referendum on the president's performance. These findings make it clear that the governor must present favorable macroeconomic conditions to get re-elected. They also discovered that this effect was not seen at the senatorial level. If the senators are of the president's party, depending on the national economic condition, voter's either reward or punish senators based on the president's performance.

A caveat, however, is that it would be hard to argue that the national economy and the state are completely separate. The state economy is inextricably linked to regional economies and the national economy. For example, an expanding national economy (assuming relatively cheap gas prices) could increase the demand for Cadillacs (assuming it is a normal good) from Michigan thereby improving economic conditions in Michigan. While the governor of Michigan had no direct impact on the state's expansion, this study suggests that they are held responsible. Therefore, regional and national economic conditions can without a doubt impact a state's gubernatorial elections, and this indirect effect would be difficult to parse out.

Another aspect allowing for empirical application is that the governors as the executive of their respective states share a similar role to that of the president. Most of the states give governors veto power, power of appointment, and often the governor plays an important role in the creation of the budget. Although the governors cannot engage in monetary policy, these features give the governor ample space and ability to try to effect macroeconomic outcomes. A survey of the state governments conducted by an American political scientist found that governors wield a considerable amount of power over their respective state's agenda (Wright 1967). In fact, this scholar's article found that the governor's office tended to be the dominant branch of state governments. As formerly stated the incumbent governor of Michigan was able to exert her executive power to get an increased minimum wage legislation passed despite a republican controlled legislature leading to the election. The Michigan election came, and she won with an overwhelming majority of the vote. Governors could also pursue policies that include, but are not limited to, increased public spending, expansion of state employment, manipulation of tax policies, increasing the minimum wage, etc.

Methodology and Results
To test this empirical application, it would be appropriate to look at pre- and post-gubernatorial election periods for all of the states (in the post-WWII/Keynesian period of demand management). The benefit of this experiment would be that there are 50 individual democratic states. More data points would give better picture on the existence of the political business cycle as compared to one national presidential race every four years. If the results do find evidence of electoral manipulation, it strengthens Tufte's argument, yet no results definitely weaken his claim.

Tufte posited that changes in real disposable income were a sound indicator of detecting pre-electoral manipulation. Tufte reasoned that positive changes in real disposable income were the desired outcome in pre-election periods for the incumbent. If a relationship existed, he thought there would be clear evidence for the political business cycle. Regressing this measure with pre- and post-elections periods should give the data needed to identify the presence of a trend. A sample equation is as follows:

Changes in Real Disposable Income = α + β (Pre/Post-election period) + ε

If the empirical application, lending support to Tufte's political business cycle, the beta coefficient should positive and the t-score yield a value greater than two for a robust statistical relationship between positive changes in real disposable income and pre-election periods. Conversely, the relationship between post-election periods and no changes (or negative changes) in disposable income should exhibit no relationship or (an inverse relationship); in other words, we should not see increases in real disposable income during non-election phases.

These relationships do not happen in a vacuum, however. There are instances in which the degree of the relationship should be magnified or mitigated depending on several factors. One dynamic to take into consideration is whether the gubernatorial election is synced with the presidential election or not, particularly a presidential election when the incumbent president is seeking re-election. In the states that are synced with the presidential election we would expect the pre-election economic expansion to be greater. The president's opportunistic behavior coupled with the similar behavior of the governor should amplify the short-run economic boost. States with different election years should display some sort of manipulation, but less pronounced since less is at stake on a national level with gubernatorial elections synced with congressional midterm elections; however, the effect should be positive.

Now that real disposable income has been examined, or the potential result of economic tampering, the means to achieve this end needs to be considered. Politicians may not be able to effect real disposable income as desired, but evidence of the attempting to increase disposable income should be present. Thus, policies like public spending and tax policies must be analyzed with election phases. There is an expectation to see a pattern of increasing public spending prior to elections. Increased public employment, social programs, increased public projects, etc would all be good examples. Changes in tax policy are another good way to discover an incumbent's attempt at manipulation. Tufte observed this idea on the national level. He found that increases in taxes did happen after the election and not before (Tufte 1979). State governors, if consistent with Tufte's model, should decrease taxes before the election and increase afterwards.

This effect, however, would vary depending on the composition of the state government. If the governor's office and the legislature are of the same party, the ability to manipulate is greater. Less veto players should increase the magnitude of the political business cycle. On the other hand, a governor and legislature of a different party stripe would minimize the effect. The governor ability to pass legislation slows when a gridlock exists; the legislature is less likely to agree with the opposing party's policies.

In addition, states that give more institutional power (i.e. less oversight by the legislature) should also exhibit a great effect of the political business cycle. For instance, some states allow governors to appoint the heads of agencies without the necessary approval of any other branch. States without these checks allow for governors to appoint officials in lock-step with their own policies. As a result of less institutional veto gates the more room the executive can more quickly and effectively alter policy outcomes that benefit his or her election bid.

Although no tests were conducted given the nature of the assignment, a study in Canada found that sub-national provincial elections did in fact show evidence of opportunistic behavior on behalf of the incumbent (Petry; Imbeau; Crête; Clavet 1999). Most of the provinces exhibit expansions in public spending before elections and spending reductions after the elections. They also found that in the non-election phase partisan differences between candidates surface, meaning that candidates will pursue policies that appeal to their party base. These partisan policies dissolve as the election approaches, and opportunistic policies are pursued. The cycle was found even amid overall government cutbacks in spending. This Canadian study of elections on the sub-national level could shed light on potential results for a future study on state gubernatorial elections and Tufte's model.

Another complement to this application comes from Political Scientist William Clark's book Capitalism, Not Globalism (2004). In his book Clark found that with fixed exchange rates, central bank independence, and capital mobility, countries in the European Union exhibit cycles of expansion pre-election. Since the United States is a conglomeration of the 50 independent economies brought together by an economic monetary union, the U.S. is analogous to the European Union. The individual states cannot manipulate monetary policy, making the central bank independent. Brought together under the one currency in the United States also brings a sort of fixed exchange rate among the states. Each state cannot alter the exchange rate regime. Lastly, capital is mobile. Assets can be moved from state to state with great ease. Thus, there similar behavior should be observed in the individual states in the U.S. as the countries of the European Union with regards to political business cycles.

Conclusion
So after the data is analyzed, there should be a clear attempt for governors to influence the economic conditions prior to elections. Governors and presidents share the same incentive, the same tools, and as long as the voters are retrospective, this sort of behavior should reward the incumbent. The assumptions are plausible, and such cycles have been observed on the provincial level in Canada as well as European nations under the constraints of the monetary union. Therefore, Tufte's idea of political business cycles should extend empirically to the American state governments.",0,0,4.81,7.51,18048
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Literature Review on the Impact of Institutional Reforms on Electoral Corruption,"Jose V. Abueva, head of the Citizen's Movement for a Federal Philippines (CMFP), is calling for change. Our obsolete form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of personality, patronage, cronyism and corruption without public accountability, he writes in Charter Change for Good Governance (Abueva 2005, 3). He and other supporters of a Philippine Charter Change (commonly referred to as cha-cha), assert that adopting a federal-parliamentary system in place of the traditional unitary-presidential system will help address the Philippines' fundamental problems (Abueva 2005, 33-38). But are they correct? Are cha-cha supporters justified in believing that overhauling their country's electoral system will solve its problems of corruption? I will explore the validity of their claim with particular focus on answering the question: to what extent can a country's electoral methods temper the effects of public office corruption?

I will center my analysis on the consequences of possible electoral reform in the Philippines—a switch from a majoritarian system to closed-list proportional representation—and its potential impact on vote buying. Vote buying involves the individual immediate and private exchange of goods services, or cash for electoral support, usually in violation of legal norms (Hicken, ""How do Rules…, 51). Although corruption has many forms, I will focus on its manifestation in the political arena, public offices in particular. In the context of this paper, corruption is defined generally as the misuse of public power, office or authority for private benefit—through bribery, extortion, influence, peddling, nepotism, fraud and embezzlement(United Nations Development Programme, Fighting Corruption to Improve Governance ). Although corruption is a serious and well known problem in the Philippines, and indeed in many countries around the world, measuring it is extremely challenging (Morató 2007, personal email). Thus, in addition to the challenge of determining appropriate electoral, one must also investigate proper techniques of corruption measurement.

The literature on comparative parties and elections offers insights into the possible motivations for candidates to engage in vote buying strategies. Differing electoral systems promote contrasting tactics for candidates to win elections. In certain systems candidates rely mainly on personal reputation and individually focused campaigns to gain voter support. Such systems are often characterized by intra-party competition, which occurs when members of the same party (copartisans) must campaign against each other within the same district (Hicken, ""How do Rules…, 49). In other systems, candidates depend on the label of their political party rather than their own status, opting to separate themselves from their competitors through partisan differences. These systems typically portray inter-party competition since the party's label and reputation constitute the key currency for candidates (Hicken, ""How do Rules…, 48). Ultimately, the extent to which a country's electoral rules encourage inter versus intra party competition plays a large role in determining the incentives to engage in electoral corruption.

In his discussion of the effectiveness of institutional reforms on electoral corruption, Allen Hicken identifies strong incentives to cultivate a personal vote (a feature distinctive to intra-party competition) as a key factor in facilitating vote buying strategies (Hicken 2007, How do Rules…, 48-49). Candidates adopt differing election tactics to suit their institutional and political environment. Because vote buying is a useful approach in garnering personal votes, it is more likely to occur in countries with extremely personalized electoral and party systems and less likely in countries where parties are stronger and party labels are more valuable to voters and candidates (Hicken 2007, ""How Effective are…, 146). Systems that promote intra-party competition and personal vote cultivation include single-non-transferable vote (SNTV) and open list proportional representation (Hicken 2007, “How Effective are…, 147).

In addition to vote buying, candidates may also cultivate personal votes by calling attention to policy or factional differences within their party. Such a strategy often leads to fighting between copartisans, which further undermines party cohesion and dilutes the value of the party label (Hicken, ""How do Rules…, 50). In order to bypass this dilemma, party leaders allow or encourage candidates to cultivate personal support networks by directing (or promising to direct) pork…to a candidate's constituents (Hicken, ""How do Rules…, 50). Pork barrel relates to the promise of particularistic forms of government largesse to a candidate's constituents (Hicken, “How do Rules…, 50). Though promises of pork are common in every democracy, they are especially prevalent in candidate-centered electoral systems. Pork barrel corruption is therefore an additional byproduct of systems lacking strong parties.

In summary, the strength of the party system, largely determined by a country's electoral methods, can influence the prevalence of corruption in the political arena. Candidate-centered electoral systems typically produce intra-party competition and increased incentives to shun party label in favor of personal vote cultivation. According to work conducted by Miriam Golden and Eric Chang, the resulting governments of candidate-centered electoral systems also tend to be more corrupt (Chang and Golden 2001, 61-62).

The current political environment in the Philippines is dominated by intra-party competition. During elections, it is not so much the political parties that are the real mobilizing organizations but the candidate's machinery and other networks of relatives, friends, political associates and allies (Rocamora 1998). Not surprisingly, vote buying is rampant during elections, with many selling their votes to the highest bidder (Coronel 2004).

The Philippine political system, established by the 1987 Constitution, consists of a bicameral national legislature. Its lower house is composed of 214 representatives elected through singe member district (SMD) plurality (ACE: The Electoral Knowledge Network). However, only 80% of the lower house representatives are elected through plurality; beginning in 1998, 20% of the house must be elected through party-list proportional representation (Holmes and Teehankee). The senate is composed of 24 members elected nationally for 6 year terms through simple plurality (ACE: The Electoral Knowledge Network). In addition to SNTV and open list PR, SMD plurality systems, which allow multiple candidates from the same party to run in a district, is known to promote intra-party competition (Hicken, ""How Effective are…). Essentially, the adversarial nature of Philippine politics and government is rooted in the fractured and personalistic nature of political contestation that has been abetted by predominant plurality systems (Holmes and Teehankee).

Because a country's electoral system can influence the prevalence of vote buying, one should theoretically be able to reverse the process through electoral reform. How can the hyper-personalistic—when intraparty competition becomes more prominent than interparty competition—Philippine system be impacted by electoral reform (Shugart 2001, 176)? If incentives to cultivate personal vote exacerbate vote buying and other forms of corruption, how can it be remedied? Hicken suggests that intra-party competition may be eliminated (or at least diminished) through the adoption of a closed list proportional representation (PR) system. Multiple winner rules, such as closed-list PR, have many advantages over majoritarian, or winner take all systems. First, because PR rules allow for more than one winner, candidates have less compulsion to actively cultivate a personal vote; there's more than one available seat, thus making competition less intense. In a closed list PR system, voters can indicate preference for a party list, but not for any single candidate; the list order is determined by party leaders. Because the list order is unknown to the candidates, their chances of victory are directly linked to their party's success. Candidates are more likely to promote the party label rather than themselves, thereby setting the foundation for strong parties (Hicken, “How do Rules..). Strong party labels will in turn diminish intra-party competition, thus shifting the favor away from personal vote cultivation toward party vote cultivation.

PR systems also impact voter turnout, typically increasing them (Hicken 2007, personal email). Because PR systems allow for more than one winner, voters have less incentive to vote strategically. They don't have to be concerned about wasting their vote by supporting a third, less prominent party since seats will be awarded based on the proportion of votes received. Voters are therefore more likely to have a party in the race that is closer to their ideal points, ultimately increasing their turnout at the polls (Hicken 2007, personal email).

Greater voter turnout may translate into a reduction in a candidate's motivation to vote buy. If a candidate is planning to buy his votes, higher voter turnouts would require him to buy more in order to win. An increase in voter turnout thus also increases the cost of vote buying, potentially making it too costly to be an effective strategy to win an election (Hicken 2007, How do Rules…). Candidates can either choose to spend more money, or if this is no longer a viable option, adopt an alternate strategy in order to gain the necessary support. However, politicians may be adapting by discovering new ways to purchase votes. Hicken, for example, has suggested that in addition to directly purchasing votes, politicians may now be using the construction of schools and universities as a new method to garner votes.

While there appears to be support from other authors in favor of closed-list PR systems, other authors have different views. Shugart's research on mixed electoral systems asserts that a combination of majoritarian and proportional representation is the most efficient form of government in relation to corruption control. Although Shugart makes a valid argument, a mixed member system is not suitable for the Philippines. Mixed member systems (MMS) will not deter the current candidate centered electoral system since it maintains a tier composed of single member districts elected through plurality. Vote buying and corruption are directly linked to a candidate's incentive to cultivate personal vote, and MMS retains this drive.

Thailand underwent revisions to its political structure, and much can be learned from its experience. In 1997, it adopted a new constitution which reformed its electoral system, though its reforms did not apply until the 2001 elections. While the drafters had many goals, it is fair to say that they designed the constitution chiefly to combat vote buying and money politics (Hicken, ""How Effective are…, 153). Prior to the 1997 reforms, Thailand employed a block-vote (BV), majoritarian system. Similar to the current state of the Philippines, Thailand was plagued with weak party labels, candidate centered-electoral systems and intra-party competition. The 1997 reforms replaced the BV method with a mixed member two tier system (Hicken, Lessons from Thailand). Under the new plan, the house consisted of 400 seats elected from single member districts via plurality rule, and 100 seats chosen from a single nationwide district via closed list PR (Hicken, Lessons from Thailand).

The reforms had a dramatic impact on the number of parties. Table 1 illustrates how the effective number of parties (ENP) was markedly reduced from a national, pre-reform average of 7.2 to 2.1 in the 2005 election. Significant party realignment occurred due to the new electoral system.

Table 1: Pre and Post Reform Effective Number of Political Parties (ENPP)

Table here
Source: Hicken 2005, Lessons from Thailand: The Constitution of 1997

Croissant and Pojar best describe the impact of the 1997 reforms on the Thai Party system:

The trend is from a highly fragmented albeit low ideologically polarized party system with shallow programmatic profiles of, and thus only rudimentary policy differences between, individual political parties towards deepening polarization between two large political parties with different political platforms and clearly distinguished groups of voters. While the 2001 election intensified this development, the 2005 election has consolidated it (2006, Quo Vadis Thailand…).

The impact of the reforms on vote buying was somewhat ambiguous, however. Hicken and others argue that there was an overall reduction in the amount of vote buying, yet none can point to a proper method to quantify these levels (Hicken, ""How effective are…).

Because party numbers were clearly reduced, the reforms ushered in a party-centered electoral system. The [2005] election strengthened the recent trend towards a highly concentrated party system (Croissant and Pojar ). Indeed, the newly established strong party labels also induced sharper policy profile of the parties (Croissant and Pojar). Intra-party competition began to disappear in the 2001 elections (Hicken, ""How do Rules…). For the first time in recent Thai electoral history, political parties…put significant effort into developing coordinated party-centered electoral strategies (Hicken, ""How do Rules…). The party fragmentation that characterized pre-reform elections was replaced with a clear domination of the newly formed Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party (Hicken, “How do Rule…) . For the first time since 1957 a single party (the TRT) nearly captured a majority of the seats; it later gained a majority after a smaller party disbanded and joined its ranks(Hicken, ""How do Rule…). As illustrated in Table 2, the TRT party secured clear majority in the 2005 elections. Also, note that smaller parties disbanded, and joined the dominant TRT party to further reduce party fragmentation.

Voter turnout was also greatly affected by the reforms, as shown in Table 3. The 2001 and 2005 elections marked record highs in voter registration and turnout. For example, there is a 6.4% jump in voter turnout between the 1996 and the 2001 parliamentary elections. This trend continued during the 2005 election, with a 6.9% jump from 1996.

As the table indicates, voter registration and turnout were higher during the post reform elections. At first glance, these results seem to indicate that a switch to PR increased voter turnout. However, the Thai case is more complicated. Amongst the reforms established by the 1997 Constitution was a stipulation that made voting compulsory (Croissant and Pojar 2006, Quo Vadis Thailand…). The cause for increased voter turnout during the 2001 and 2005 elections is therefore unclear. While it is still possible that PR was responsible more investigation needs to be conducted in order to separate the impact of these two reforms.

The data concerning the overall impact of the reforms on vote buying are mixed, sometimes even conflicting. According to data gathered by Croissant and Pojar, shown in figure 1, there appears to be a spike in vote buying during the 2001 election then a sudden reduction to typical levels in the 2005 races. These results indicate that electoral reform had, if anything, a negative impact on vote buying.

Figure 1: Estimated Amount of Money Spent in Vote Buying, 1995-2005, Billion Baht[47]

Figure here
*Source: Croissant and Pojar, 2005

These results indicate either of two conclusions. First that the 1997 reforms produced their desired effect. Political corruption went down, as evidenced by the reduction in the number of disqualified MPs. But because none of the disqualifications was on the grounds of vote buying, intimidation, violence, illegal promises, or other chicanery, there is reason to be dubious of the EC in 2005 (The Nation 2005). In fact, The Poll Watch Foundation, Thailand's most prominent election monitor, stated that vote buying in the 2005 election was more serious than in the 2001 election (Croissant and Pojar 2005, Quo Vadis Thailand…). The second conclusion is that the spike in vote buying and increased numbers of invalidated MPs indicates (contrary to logic) that the 1997 reforms were actually working. The establishment of stronger parties and the diminishment of personal vote cultivation helped increased vigilance for corruption. Perhaps the reason why previous numbers appeared lower was because there was less stringent monitoring over corruption practices.

In contrast to the Poll Watch Foundation's findings, other studies claim that less cash was involved in the 2005 elections than in previous years. According to Croissant and Pojar:

A survey conducted among 13,836 community leaders in all 400 constituencies throughout the country between January 24 and February 2, 2005, discovered widespread vote buying, totaling almost 10 billion Baht (approximately US $250 million), which would constitute a large decrease in the amount of money spent for vote-buying compared with previous elections (Croissant and Pojar 2005, Quo Vadis Thailand…).

Furthermore, some Thai political scientists also support the belief that vote buying was reduced in 2005 (Croissant and Pojar).

These conflicting analyses on corruption levels in post-reform Thailand testify to the difficulty involved in measuring political corruption. In order to properly assess whether or not reforms to governmental structures can impact the prevalence of political corruption, one must first identify a reliable method of corruption measurement.

Allen Hicken has begun investigating this problem, suggesting that perhaps corruption could be measured through the construction of schools. He is currently conducting a study to investigate whether schools and universities are being formed during election times in the Philippines as a new method of garnering votes. His theory is interesting and I propose looking into the locations of the schools in addition to the timing of their construction. For example, if politicians are indeed building schools to attain votes, communities with lesser populations and which are further away from major highways should not be of interest. Politicians will get more for their money by building in highly populated areas, and these communities should therefore be less likely to have universities or schools built in their areas. I also propose extending this concept beyond schools.

In addition to the construction of schools, politicians may also utilize healthcare as an additional incentive for votes. It should therefore also be worthwhile to investigate the construction of hospitals and clinics as well as the number of public health workers and supplies (e.g. ambulances) allotted during election times.

While PR reforms appear to have introduced significant changes to the governmental structure, its impact on corruption is still unclear. While various authors have shown the impact of PR reforms on party systems, they have yet to demonstrate that corruption really did diminish. Thus, prior to answering the question of whether electoral reforms can impact corruption, we must first address how corruption can be properly measured and tracked. Once reliable indicators are established, one can truly determine how electoral reforms can reduce political corruption.

Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Candidate debates in Vermont ??,"Question 1 Part A (1)
The Supreme Court has held that candidate debates are a special class of programming because they are by design a forum for political speech by candidates and they are of exceptional significance in the electoral process. 1 For this reason, public forum principles can be applied to candidate debates.

The debate in Vermont is a designated public forum because as the Court held in Forbes to create a forum of this type, the government must intend to make the property “generally available to a class of speakers. 2 The format of the VCB debate allows unfretted access to the candidates by members of the audience, while also allowing general access to a class of speakers, which in this case are the candidates for election to the US Senate seat. Candidate Osetek is a member of this class of speakers. Consequently, his exclusion by the government from the designated public forum is subject to strict scrutiny.3

As such the VCB's decision to exclude Osetek will fail to withstand a review by the courts. Osetek was excluded because he was, according to the VCB Administrator, a dirty hippy. Clearly, VCB prevented Osetek from participating in the debate because of his views as a member of the Green Party, which diverges on a wide range of issues from both Democrats and Republicans. The court's ruling in Forbes has been understood to prohibit limits on participation in debates based on subjective assessment of the seriousness of the viewpoint being expressed. 4 Accordingly, VCB's action towards Osetek fails to serve a compelling state interest narrowly drawn to achieve that interest. Furthermore, it only serves to prevent a legitimate candidate from expressing his views to a public gathering, at a public institution, at a publicly funded debate.

While VCB may claim that Osetek was excluded because of a lack of public interest in his candidacy, which was a successful approach for AETC in Forbes, that argument does not apply in this case. Osetek is currently in a statistical dead heat with both the Democratic and Republican candidate. Moreover, VCB may argue that the debate, in fact, is a non-public forum, where in order to exclude candidates it only needs to show that their action was a reasonable, viewpoint neutral exercise of journalistic discretion. 5 Yet, even if the court rules that the debate was in fact a non-public forum, VCB's actions will still fail to stand as a viewpoint neutral exercise. By their own admission, Osetek was excluded because of his status as a dirty hippy with views different from those of Republicans and Democrats.

PART A (2)
The 1st Amendment protects the rights of people and organizations to associate freely with whomever they choose. Candidate Osetek, the Green Party, and the Democratic Party have agreed to associate. This decision was based on each of the actors' determination that by listing Osetek as a Green Party / Democratic Party candidate on the ballot, all would benefit in the election. The Supreme Court has held that the Party's determination of the boundaries of its own association, and of the structure which best allows it to pursue its political goals, is protected by the constitution. 6 By denying the parties' request to include both the Green Party and Democratic Party name after Osetek, Vermont's Secretary of State has violated the associational rights of those involved. Party's… under the First Amendment, have the right to organize with like-minded citizens in support of common political goals. 7 Clearly the two parties feel that they share at least some common political goals; this is reflected in their desire to appear together on the ballot after Osetek's name. For this reason, the constitution protects their right to associate.

Vermont's Secretary of State may respond by arguing that the USSC in Timmons held that prohibiting fusion candidacies of the sort here is constitutional because the ban does not involve regulation of political parties' internal affairs and core associational activities. 8 The court held that since the burden on the party's associational rights is not severe, the state only needs to show that the interests behind the regulation are sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation. 9 Party labels provide voters with an indication of the views of the candidate, thus a candidate with two parties listed could confuse the electorate. States have an important interest in fostering informed and educated expressions of the popular will in a general election. 10 Thus, The Secretary of State will argue that Osetek's fusion candidacy will impair the voters' ability to make an educated decision. Finally, the court held that preventing fusion candidacies protects the 2-party system, an important state interest.11

PART B
The Good Government Coalition's proposed public financing scheme appears to be unconstitutional. When a public financing scheme becomes so beneficial that candidates would be foolish to not participate, the candidates 1st Amendment rights are violated. While the courts have upheld public financing schemes in the past, the benefits of participation in Good Government's proposed scheme far outweigh those considered previously by the courts. Although both participants and non-participants will see their contributions from PAC's and 527's limited, the matching funds and lack of an expenditure ceiling makes the proposed scheme unconstitutionally coercive.

As referenced in Daggett the 1st Circuit has held that the… benchmark of whether candidates 1st Amendment rights are burdened by a public financing system is whether the system allows candidates to make a voluntary choice about whether to pursue public funding 12 While the courts have realized that for any candidate to choose public financing there must be some benefits for making such a decision, the courts have held that when a system becomes beneficial to the point that candidates are coerced to join, that system infringes on their 1st Amendment rights.

In Daggett the 1st Circuit upheld Maine's public financing scheme that gave candidates matching funds up to two times the initial disbursement of public funds.13 The Court points to a 6th circuit decision, which upheld a Kentucky statute that gave candidates a two-for one match on private contributions raised- more beneficial then the scheme examined in Daggett.14 Nevertheless, Good Government proposes a scheme that would provide participating candidates with matching funds of 4 times each private donation. Additionally, the scheme sets no expenditure ceiling for those in the system. This scheme is more beneficial for participating candidates then the systems examined in both Daggett and Gabble.

Seeing that they system automatically gives participating candidates half of the total raised by the previous election's winning candidate and that it provides 4 times the amount of private donations received without an expenditure limit, candidates lack a rational voluntary choice for joining the system. Candidates would not rationally choose to forgo public funding because they would have to raise at least 4 times the amount of private dollars to match the spending power of those participating candidates. For this reason, the proposed system strays beyond the pale, creating disparities so profound that they become impermissibly coercive 15

Remember that the court in Buckley v. Valeo held that money is speech thus applying strict scrutiny review to any scheme that would limit the use of money by candidates to express their views.16 The contribution limits for PACs and 527s appear to be constitutional because they are narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest of preventing both the appearance and instances of actual corruption. However, since the scheme would place a coercive burden on the speech rights of candidates, overall it will fail a strict scrutiny review.

Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Correspondence Between South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and President Gerald Ford,"On January 27, 1973 the United States, North Vietnam, South Vietnam and the Viet Cong signed the Paris Peace Accords. The accords ended American involvement in Southeast Asia, and paved the way for the eventual conquest of South Vietnam by the communist North. The stated conditions of the Paris Accords were to end the hostilities, withdraw American troops within sixty days, guarantee of South Vietnam's right to self-determination, and facilitate peaceful negotiations between the North and South aimed at reunifying the country.1 In April of 1975 Saigon fell to the Communist North, in violation of the Paris Peace Accords, terminating the South Vietnamese government.

On August 9, 1974 Richard Nixon resigned as President of the United States following his impeachment in Congress. His Vice President, Gerald Ford, assumed the presidency. Shortly thereafter, on August 20, 1974, Congress significantly cut the levels of aid designated to South Vietnam, all but ensuring that country's loss at the hands of the North Vietnamese.2 This action goes against a promise by Nixon to aid South Vietnam if the North violated the terms of the Paris Peace Accords.3 The slashing of military aid, the growing desperation of the situation, and the promise made by Nixon became the basis for a series of correspondences between President Ford, and South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu regarding Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, several days after President Thieu resigned, the last U.S. citizens and military personally evacuated Saigon, ending nearly 25 years of American involvement in Southeast Asia.

On August 21st, 1974, one day following Congress' cutbacks of military aid to South Vietnam, President Thieu sent President Ford a letter. President Thieu emphasizes the amount of effort his people, and America, put into the country the previous twenty-five years, and reiterated, the Government of the Republic of Vietnam has done its utmost to respect and implement the Paris Agreement. 4 President Thieu highlights a growing fear of North Vietnamese aggression, which appeared inevitable. He asks President Ford to show the communist side that there is no hope for them either to break the will of the South Vietnamese People or to undermine the support of the U.S. for the Republic of Vietnam. 5 President Thieu admits that peace cannot be achieved with the communists without support from the United States, particularly Congress.

On September 19th, 1974 President Thieu again wrote a letter to President Ford, detailing him on the escalated armed attacks by communist forces. It does not appear that President Ford sent a reply to President Thieu's letter dated August 21, 1974. In the September letter, President Thieu shows his negativity regarding the resumption of peaceful talks with the North Vietnamese, which were a condition of the Paris Peace Accords.6 President Thieu declares, the Hanoi regime openly declare their active support for movements aimed at overthrowing the legal government of the Republic of Vietnam, while they intensify their infiltrations and military action, thus baring their plans for a forcible conquest of the whole South Vietnam. 7 President Thieu believes that the Communist stance is based on the (correct) belief that America will not intervene. The situation was worsening, and obviously President Thieu desperately needed American assistance.

In 1972 Congress passed the Case Amendment, which increased Congressional oversight on executive agreements with foreign nations.8 President Ford could not directly intervene, nor offer aid through an executive agreement without facing extreme criticism and backlash from Congress. Congress also was not willing to appropriate the funds after spending so much money in Vietnam. Public opinion against sending in troops to save the South Vietnamese government made that option impossible.

On October 26, 1974, President Ford sent President Thieu a response. President Ford's letter, which is notably not urgent and almost lackadaisical, has a very reassuring tone to it. President Ford confirms that his administrations policy remains the same as Nixon's.9 Ford acknowledges South Vietnam's need for aid, and assures President Thieu of his efforts to provide the needed assistance. President Ford wrote, I agree with you that it is essential that my government clearly indicate its support for your government and for the full implementation of the Paris Agreements. 10 Beyond simple rhetoric President Ford's response does not sufficiently address or mitigate the real needs of President Thieu's government.

The White House received two letters from President Thieu on January 24th and 25th. The close timing of the letters caused confusion amongst President Ford's advisors, and President Ford waited nearly a month to provide a response. The two letters from January outline the attacks made by North Vietnamese forces and the beginnings of a desperate situation. President Thieu also points out that the communist forces were re-supplied by other communist countries, while the South Vietnamese are not receiving such help.11 President Thieu pleaded to Ford:

I understand that some sections of the American public opinion have been induced into believing that too much aid to the Republic of Viet-Nam would only prolong the war and encourage us not to seek a political solution. The record clearly shows the opposite. Reduction of military assistance to Viet-Nam by the U.S. Congress has only encouraged the Communists…Taking advantage of the scarcity of our supplies and hoping that adequate aid for us will not be forthcoming, they are once again undertaking to destroy our government structure by force of arms with a view of imposing a solution of their own.

By the time of President Ford's response on February 24, 1974 North Vietnamese forces were on a heavy offensive into South Vietnam. President Ford confirmed in a press conference in January that the United States would not re-enter the war, and administration officials publicly said that America reneged on its promise to retaliate against the North Vietnamese for violating the Paris Agreement.12

President Ford's letter dated in February promises more rhetoric from the United States against North Vietnam. President Ford commends President Thieu's efforts to continue negotiations with the communists, and emphasizes that the North Vietnamese are the aggressors.13 This letter promises no additional help beyond President Ford's reassuring words. It is clear from the delayed timing, and lack of action that the South Vietnamese cause is not worth the potential political damage to President Ford.

On March 22, 1975, President Ford sent President Thieu another letter. This letter followed massive losses by the South Vietnamese at the hands of the communists, resulting in a massive and chaotic retreat by South Vietnamese forces and civilians.14 In the letter President Ford mentions his disturbances at the aggression from Hanoi, and expresses his confidence in Thieu's ability to hold his country together. President Ford assures President Thieu that he will make every effort to supply South Vietnam with adequate military assistance.15

Three days later President Thieu sent his response. In very desperate terms President Thieu declares, the military situation in South Viet-Nam is very grave and is growing worse by the hour…Saigon itself is threatened. 16 Furthermore Thieu points out:

That [South Vietnam] signed [the Paris Agreement], not because we credulously believed in the enemy's goodwill, but because we were certain of the common resolution of our two governments to make the Agreement work…firm pledges were then given to us that the United States will retaliate swiftly and vigorously to any violation of the Agreement by the enemy and will provide the Republic of Viet-Nam with adequate military and economic assistance…those pledges have now become the most crucial ones to our survival. 17

After this desperate plea, President Thieu highlights two steps that would help stop the North Vietnamese. Thieu requests a B-52 bombing raid and military aid, both of which never came. At the end of the letter President Thieu appeals to President Ford's, and America's, conscience regarding the credibility of American foreign policy, as well as the ability of the South Vietnamese people to remain free.18

The March 25 letter from President Thieu reflects the growing desperation in South Vietnam. The country was a month away from being completely overtaken, and President Thieu obviously recognized the growing urgency. He unfortunately did not realize that President Ford could not respond in a way that would save South Vietnam. Congress would not allow him to commit more troops, nor increase military aid.19 President Ford was effectively powerless to help the South Vietnamese.

The last correspondence between President Ford and President Thieu was a letter from the former to the latter on March 25, 1975, a response to the latter's message that same day. President Ford said, I am convinced that in the end the South Vietnamese people, under your leadership, will be successful in their fight to preserve their independence and free institutions. 20 Whether President Ford believed this or not is unclear. Ford talks about making urgent efforts to get Congress to approve aid for South Vietnam, which later failed.21 It appears that President Ford is prepared to take every step he possibly can to remain committed to South Vietnam, but it is Congress that eventually declined to help President Thieu.

On April 12, 1975, President Thieu resigned. Saigon would fall on April 30th, a few hours after the last Marines left the embassy.22 The correspondence between President Ford and President Thieu depict an accurate timeline of the growing desperation in South Vietnam. President Thieu became increasingly desperate for American aid, which would never sufficiently come. President Ford tried to reassure the South Vietnamese leader by expressing his confidence as the situation deteriorated. In the end, there was not much President Ford could actually do. He needed Congressional approval, and that was impossible to get considering the domestic policy implications involvement in Vietnam had. American involvement in Vietnam just ended, and our elected leaders were not about to re-enter.

The United States pressured the South Vietnamese to accept the Paris Agreement to end American involvement, with the assurance of continued aid. Nixon's departure because of political scandal negatively impacted the strength and feasibility of this assurance. Many South Vietnamese foresaw their inevitable destruction if the Americans withdrew.23 The correspondences between the two country's leaders gives an insight into the decline of the South Vietnamese country, and the inability of President Ford to fulfill promises made by his predecessor. The letters reflect the culmination of an American foreign policy nightmare that lasted nearly three decades, and took the lives of nearly 50,000 young Americans. In the end, America's reputation was significantly damaged by its inability to protect its South Vietnamese ally.",100,93.22,35.24,19.1,11214
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Background of Policy Issue- Human Trafficking in an International Context,"International organizations have been created to advance trade, peace, and solve diplomatic problems among many states (Slomanson 119). International society has, in spite of the diversity of culture and political systems, been progressively drawn closer together and become more unified as problems become more global than local or regional (Slomanson 121). Increasingly, people do not want to wait until problems in distant parts of the world spread to their own area and are beginning to pressure their government, the United Nations, and international organizations to act on problems before they get to out of hand (Slomanson 121).

Human trafficking is a serious and virtually unpublicized crime, which exists in many countries, including developed nations in Europe and North America. Human trafficking, mainly of women and children for prostitution and child sex, is the fastest growing organized crime activity in the world, producing an estimated $70 billion in illegal profits and enslaving as many as two million individuals (Kreisher). Slaves are now often kept for only a short time for agricultural or other forms of labor, are very inexpensive and considered disposable (Bales 9). The main predictors of slavery in a country from highest to lowest are high levels of government and police corruption, high level of infant mortality, population has high proportion of young people and children, and the country has low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (Bales p. 99). Until corruption and economic difficulties can be addressed in a productive and meaningful way in many countries, there will be more than adequate supply of potential trafficking victims.

Various types of organizations are involved in combating the world's problems, including human trafficking. Public international organizations (PIO) must be: (1) established by some form of international agreement among States; (2) created as a new international legal entity that functions independently of State sovereign control; and (3) created under International Law (Slomanson 118). Nongovernmental organizations are those organizations not created by treaties but still operating at international levels (Slomanson 129). The NGOs have been carrying a heavy load of researching and informing others about the levels of human trafficking around the world. Governments and international organizations are beginning to take notice and slowly develop plans of action. International organizations and governments must continue to research human trafficking causes and affects, educate the publics of both origin and destination countries, and develop practical and sustainable plans to address the corruption and economic difficulties which leave people especially vulnerable to human trafficking

The United Nations
When the United Nations was forming and developing since World War II, it was conceived to implement a system of collective security to discourage the unilateral use of military force. The United Nations also serves as a forum for improving the economic and social conditions of its member States (Slomanson 128). Powerful states have tried to maintain their sovereignty as much as possible, while less developed and economically secured states have usually tried to work through the United Nations to advance their countries capabilities on the world stage, as well as domestically. The six principal organs of the United Nations are the: General Assembly (GA), Security Council (SC), Economic and Social Council (ESCO), Trusteeship Council (TC), Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), (Slomanson 136) many of which could be, and are, used to combat human trafficking.

The General Assembly cannot issue binding laws to the nation-states of the world, but can and does promote conferences and studies on social, economic, political and other issues which allow local, regional, and international organizations the opportunity to share information and coordinate action (Slomanson 139). The Security Council does not include all member states in a debating body, as the General Assembly does, but both can perform dispute resolution between states.

The Security Council consists of five permanent countries and ten rotating states, and despite the dramatically fewer number of states involved, because of the relative power of the security council's permanent states it has much more influence than the inclusive General Assembly. There have been movements to implement reform of the Security Council distribution to reflect world demographic trends more accurately, by encouraging permanent representatives from each continent (Slomanson 141). The Group of 77 developing states as well as the Non-Aligned Movement remain disparate, dislocated, collectively weak, and ineligible for structural leadership (Puchala 93) within the United Nations, greatly reducing their ability to affect any meaningful change of policy without the express support of the United States (Puchala 94). The Security Council is responsible for maintaining, or creating, international peace through the use of diplomacy, economic pressure, and force as a last resort (Slomanson 141). Because states more often then not refuse to cede any substantial sovereignty to the United Nations, veto authority was given to the five permanent members of the Security Council. States are reluctant to cede sovereignty because they wish to continue to decide if, when and where to engage in hostilities with other states, or even their own citizens (Slomanson 143). Therefore the United Nations' standing army called for in Article 43 was not created because states did not want an international police force able to react to threats to the peace in different ways than UN members might prefer (Slomanson 143). This insistence on substantial sovereignty has certainly hindered the United Nations as a whole in performing some of the goals of the charter, specifically investigations into trafficking throughout various states, which must be coordinated through local police with their express consent, which cannot be expected if high levels of corruption and complicity exist within the state or region from which the trafficking originates.

The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations is charged with promoting (a) higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; (b) solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems; and international cultural and educational cooperation; and (c) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex, language, or religion (Slomanson 144). Like the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council commissions reports and conferences on various issues, including human trafficking. The focus is usually on migration, information campaigns, and victim services in the reports issued from Europe or North America. There is very little research or expressed opinion on how to specifically address the circumstances which contributed to the victims being vulnerable to trafficking in the first place.

Within the Secretariat, or bureaucracy of the United Nations, the Secretary General issued a 2005 report on the new types of threats faced by the world, now that people are threatened most not by inter-state conflicts, but by individuals, transnational groups, or their own governments (Puchala 113). He was promoting collective security, development, and human rights on the part of all nations to combat common security threats, recognizing that different states had different priorities and interests, not to mention different beliefs about the best approaches to solve various problems within the greater security setting (Puchala 114). While stopping human trafficking through increased aid and development is generally considered a security, as well as humanitarian, goal, development is vague and undefined, with no specific directives given to states or organizations on the best development plan for each of the hotspot regions for human trafficking.

The European Union
The European Union has been evolving over time starting wit the 1957 Treaty of Rome creating a common market, and greatly expanded powers given away by the nation-states in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty which anticipated the region having no internal frontiers, economic and monetary union, common foreign and security policy, and citizenship of the Union rather than just nation-state citizenship (Slomanson 159). International organizations are sometimes given the ability to make member states agree to an enforcement policy regarding a particular issue which affects the states involved in the organization. An example would be the European Union, in which individual states forgo their sovereignty in some areas to the EU institutions (Slomanson 128- 129). Unlike the United Nations, the EU's institutions are generally endowed with the necessary sovereignty to require member States to treat their citizens in ways that they would not otherwise be required under national law (Slomanson 161).

The European Union is able to use its ever expanding economic power to influence other nation-states' actions on certain issues, (Slomanson 161) which can be a powerful force to helping regions known for human trafficking reduce corruption and improve economic situations, if the state is at all interested in changing. Within the United Nations, the European Union is much more, than the current leader the United States, committed to and interested in leading the United Nations. The European Union is more open to using the United Nations as a multilateral, consensus building forum to promote a broad range of issues throughout the world than the United States, which sees the United Nations as just another tool for pursing its own interests (Puchala 91). Because of a lack of a common security policy or a meaningful foreign policy, the European Union is not yet able to take over the lead from the United States in most areas (Puchala 92). The European Union is very involved with the United Nations as the largest financial contributor to the UN system paying almost 40% of the regular budget and two fifths of the peacekeeping budget, as well as being the world's largest provider of overseas development assistance (Puchala 97) much of which no doubt will help in reducing the extreme circumstances tied to high human trafficking rates in certain countries.

The United States
The United States has a very complicated and turbulent relationship with the United Nations. The role of the United Nations varies according to which country and at what time is asked. Some countries feel free to ignore the United Nations and international opinion on most issues, especially internal or very distant problems, which most of the rest of the international community is extremely interested in or focused on at the time (Puchala 89). This continued disregard for the United Nations as the preeminent opinion and action dispenser of international relations by substantial numbers of countries, although certainly not all, has led to the weakening of power within the organization in certain areas, many of which were not considered consistently powerful over time anyway (Puchala 89). The role of the United States in this apparent decline, or at least ebb and flow of power within the United Nations is undeniable. The United States has not had a truly consistent and far-sighted policy with regards to the United Nations as a whole, and specific organizations with in the United Nations. Therefore, although power qualifies the United States to lead at the UN and even as this power bestows considerable influence, proclivity and policy render 'the only remaining superpower' a reluctant multilateral leader (Puchala 91). The United States still sees the United Nations as a convenient forum for the pursuit of the interests of the United States (Puchala 91).

The United States Department of State has become very concerned with human trafficking, especially in the last few years, with new legislation and increased funding such as the renewed Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 which gives the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice $2.5 million each in the fiscal year of 2008 which will be increased for both to $15 million in 2001 (Kreisher). The bill directs the State Department to establish an office to monitor and combat human trafficking, authorizes the president to support international efforts to combat trafficking and to rescue and care for victims. It also tightens rules restricting U.S. aid to countries cited for failure to stop human trafficking (Kreisher). The United States is thus interested enough in human trafficking to encourage international participation and coordination with others. There is also an economic element that can be used like the European Union to encourage offending states to toe the line. Government programs have been created to raise public awareness about reducing the demand that contributes to trafficking exploitation (Fact Sheet). The Department of Labor is currently researching potential sources of forced labor to provide to consumers but will not have a list available until 2009 (Fact Sheet). Since 2001, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorneys' Offices have seen a 600 percent increase in prosecutions and four straight years of record-high convictions (Fact Sheet) of human traffickers, proving that interest, research, and international cooperation and participation have resulted in at least some results.

Policy Recommendations
The United Nations, the European Union, and the United States along with other international and local organizations are slowly responding to the issues surrounding human trafficking. They are commissioning studies, conferences, and proposing and passing laws with harsh penalties to combat human trafficking from all angles. This approach includes necessary elements of protecting the victim and prosecuting the trafficker, but it does not address the circumstances which allowed the person to become prey for the trafficker in their place of origin. Again, the main predictors of slavery in a country are high levels of government and police corruption, high level of infant mortality, population has high proportion of young people and children, and the country has low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (Bales 99). Information from the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations along with many other international organizations is percolating down into local levels across the globe through internet, television and print campaigns warning people of the risks and consequences to those involved in human trafficking in any number of ways. Educating local law enforcement and government official is a main policy goal of the United States and organizations affiliated with it. This is only useful in places where the level of corruption is not serious enough to permeate the police and government officials. In countries with high levels of trafficking though, corruption is usually endemic, often the police will charge protection fees to ignore trafficking or even participate in the act of kidnapping itself (Bales 8). It is impossible to enslave people without the tacit support of the government and police (Bales 8).

There are calls for having permanent Security Council members from each continent to provide a more balanced representation of world demographics and issues than is currently perceived. This would be useful from the perspective of stopping human trafficking if it encouraged greater coordination between the main countries of origin, usually very underdeveloped, and the main destination countries, usually moderately to very developed in comparison. This will probably not sit well with more developed nations who will feel pressured to send more resources to affected areas then they are currently willing to send. Just sending more money to the areas seems to be the general plan espoused by many, but it should be tailored to each specific region's particular needs and strengths, as an investment instead of just aid, which is often mismanaged and brings no long lasting gains to the receiving nation.

The fight against human trafficking has been led by non-governmental organizations and international organizations for quite some time. International organizations like the European Union, are beginning to really produce procedures and results for others to study and implement. The United States must continue to work multilaterally on human trafficking issues, as it has proved capable of doing so in this area of international affairs. The United Nations must continue to promote this problem to member states and affiliated international organizations so it can be effectively recognized and ideas for solutions, from different types of economic and educational investment to prosecution standards, can be widely disseminated and implemented.

Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Increases in HIV/AIDS Education and Prevention in China,"Margaret Hamburg writes that, In the case of potential epidemics of infectious disease – whether SARS, avian flu, HIV/AIDS or the next unknown – weaknesses in the public health capabilities of China could have devastating impacts around the globe. 1 This paper will work from that assumption to track how vulnerabilities in China's ability to combat HIV/AIDS have impacted and will continue to impact both its citizens and the citizens of the world. The paper is divided into two sections: domestic responses and international collaboration. The first section briefly explores the emergence of HIV/AIDS in China and looks at the government's efforts to cope with the problem, exploring both its successes and the challenges it continues to face. The second section analyzes ways that China has collaborated with foreign nations and international organizations in the past and considers potential avenues for continued cooperation in the future. Throughout both sections, I argue that knowledge dissemination and open dialogue are the keys to solving the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China; that is, a lack of openness about the disease hindered government efforts in early years and an increase in the dissemination of information about the disease will be crucial in helping contain HIV/AIDS in the future.

Domestic Responses
The first reports of AIDS appeared in Beijing in 1985. From that year until 1988, most of China's HIV/AIDS cases were among people in coastal cities, generally foreigners or Chinese citizens who had traveled abroad. From 1989 to 1993, the disease was mainly found in the Yunnan province and was largely confined to injection drug users. By 1994, HIV began to spread beyond Yunnan, and instances of it were reported among drug users and blood donors from a variety of provinces. By 1998, there were reports of HIV infections in all 31 provinces. Additionally, while drug users still accounted for a signification portion of HIV patients at that time, there was also a steady increase in heterosexual transmission of the disease.2

Recent data reflect the growing magnitude of the HIV/AIDS crisis. In 2005, the Chinese Ministry of Health approximated that 650,000 people were infected with the disease and that there were around 70,000 new cases per year.3 These cases have moved beyond simply impacting drug users, with 48.6% of new HIV infections caused by drug use, 49.8% by sexual transmission, and 1.6% by mother-to-child transmission.4 Additionally, due to current economic, social, and cultural changes, China is more vulnerable than ever to an epidemic. Occurrences of prostitution and illegal drug use are increasing,5 while taboos against premarital and extramarital sex are decreasing.6 Additionally, as Hamburg notes, there is a growing 'floating population' of migrant workers whose circumstances make them more likely to engage in risky behaviors for HIV such as unprotected sex and/or drug use.7  These factors highlight the growing urgency for an effective government response to the ever-growing program of HIV/AIDS.

Perhaps the most notable feature of the Chinese government's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis has been an unwillingness to admit that a crisis even exists. In fact, China's first AIDS cases were discovered in 1985, yet the government refused to publicly acknowledge the epidemic until 2001.8 Indeed, Hamburg notes that the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China were marked by official denial, secrecy, and blame. As the epidemic grew, Chinese response remained surprisingly passive, despite considerable pressure – both public and private – by international organizations, donor countries, and non-governmental organizations. 9 The secrecy surrounding HIV/AIDS was a clear impediment to solving the problem; if the government would not even acknowledge the disease's existence it certainly would not create policies or fund programs dedicated to solving it. Thus, the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China were characterized by government inaction and public ignorance of the burgeoning epidemic.

However, in 2003, the government's attitude toward HIV/AIDS shifted dramatically. This transformation can be traced to two key developments. First, China's SARS outbreak generated international scrutiny and shame 10 and prompted Chinese leaders to pay more attention to other public health crises, such as HIV/AIDS. Second, a new administration – led by President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, and Health Minister Wu Yi – took office in 2003.11 The new administration radically changed the government's approach to the disease, creating a national AIDS treatment program and increasing the budget for combating HIV/AIDS from $12.5 million in 2002 to $185 million in 2006.12 New government policies, programs, and funding reflected a political will and commitment not previously in evidence 13 and signaled that the official response to HIV/AIDS was at last assuming a positive direction.

Government openness was therefore a critical development in the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS in China. In fact, once leaders became willing to acknowledge and discuss the epidemic, domestic responses to the problem became much more effective and visible. The government responded in three ways of particular interest for this study: collaborating with the media to publicize the disease, creating education and prevention programs, and implementing new HIV/AIDS policies. While each of these responses had distinct goals, the common thread among all three was that they attempted to increase public knowledge about HIV/AIDS, reflecting the fact that information dissemination has been and will continue to be a crucial strategy in combating the epidemic.

One of the government's first strategies was to publicize HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment information. For example, in November 1998, the State Council published the Medium and Long Term Plan for AIDS Prevention and Control. This Plan contained an ambitious goal: make information about HIV/AIDS available to 70% of the population by 2002. Additionally, in 1999, the government requested the Central Radio Station, CCTV, and provincial Bureaus of Broadcasting, Film and Television to make HIV/AIDS prevention and education priority topics for education through the mass media. 14 These initial efforts underlined the growing awareness that information itself would be the most potent weapon in HIV/AIDS prevention.

However, in working with the mass media to spread information about the disease, the government faced certain difficulties. For example, in 1999, China's first condom advertisement appeared on television. Shortly after it aired, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce banned the advertisement because condom advertisements were, at the time, illegal.15 This setback reflected a common problem: the taboo nature of many sexual issues. Though these taboos will be discussed at greater length below, it is sufficient here to note how a level of unease with discussing sexuality impeded HIV/AIDS prevention. Additionally, many observers criticized mass media campaigns for unrealistically portraying the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Following a weeklong media blitz in 2001 for World Aids Day, Elisabeth Rosenthal reported:

Still, many of the offerings this week seemed to be more propaganda than information. The Chinese AIDS patients featured on television news shows had generally contracted H.I.V. overseas, for example. Most ''came out'' wearing sunglasses or with backs turned to conceal their identity. On talk shows, experts were told not to discuss the many villages in central China that have been decimated by AIDS, a result of problems with the rural blood collection and supply. 16

Though the government's efforts to launch media campaigns certainly constituted a positive step forward, they were not without their shortcomings. By portraying AIDS patients disguising themselves, for example, the add campaigns only increased the stigma surrounding the disease. Additionally, by attempting to conceal information about the villages hardest hit by AIDS, the government betrayed its tendency to minimize the devastation of the epidemic.

The Chinese government looked not only to the media to publicize HIV/AIDS, but also called on local government officials and schools to increase education and prevention campaigns. State Council Document Number 7, published in 2004, instructed local governments to begin mass education campaigns in their areas. These campaigns were intended to help people avoid infection and to decrease the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS.17 The pamphlet also stressed the need to improve classroom education, especially in rural areas. For example, the government ordered that AIDS education be integrated into the curriculums of middle schools, vocational schools, and colleges.18

The results of these increased education and prevention campaigns have been mixed at best. A 2003 Human Rights Watch report noted that China had made progress with its pilot projects on HIV/AIDS education and prevention. 19 However, other studies suggest that China still has far to go in its efforts to educate the public. A January 2003 study found that 17% of Chinese citizens had never heard of HIV/AIDS and that 77% were unaware that using a condom could prevent HIV transmission. While there is some cause to be optimistic about the increased information dissemination in China, these studies remind us that, in a country with as large a population as China's, spreading information to the entire population takes great time and effort.

In addition to spreading information about HIV/AIDS, the Chinese government has also assumed a more active role in designing policies to combat the disease. In December 2003, Wen Jiabao and Wu Yu announced the Four Free and One Care policy. The program promises to provide free antiretroviral therapy to rural and impoverished citizens with HIV, free counseling and testing, free schooling to children orphaned by AIDS, free drugs that reduce the likelihood of pregnant women transmitting HIV to their unborn children, and increased economic support to households with people infected with HIV/AIDS.20 However, the 2003 Human Rights Watch report argued that the implementation of many of these policies remained little more than a distant dream. Though these policies were ambitious, they were impeded by an array of practical difficulties: insufficient funding, a weak health care infrastructure, and the lack of a national agency with sufficient authority for enforcing these policies.21 These impediments reveal the basic structural challenges faced by China's government in coping with the HIV/AIDS crisis and highlight the need for international cooperation in overcoming these challenges (discussed at length in the next section).

Though the Chinese government has certainly made great strides in addressing HIV/AIDS, it has also encountered many setbacks. Perhaps the most basic of these is the aforementioned fact that China's entire health care system is damaged. During the 1980s, economic reforms decimated China's health care system, as China's policy decision to move toward a market-based economy, combined with a general effort to decrease the role of Beijing's central government in China's regional and local affairs, resulted in enormous disruptions in public health and health care finance and delivery. 22 In fact, health care soon became too expensive for many poorer citizens to afford.23 And, as Kaufman argues, this inequity and underinvestment in health care was particularly damaging to efforts to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, which depend on public health prevention. 24 To successfully address HIV/AIDS, vulnerable groups must be educated in order for them to avoid risk behaviors. Thus, the 1980s reforms left many unable to afford treatment for HIV/AIDS and many more unable to receive the information that might have prevented them from acquiring the disease in the first place.

Another problem with China's domestic response to HIV/AIDS is a disconnect between official government policy and local actions. That is, though the government has in recent years called for a variety of reforms, local officials have often been slow to implement them or have chosen to ignore them altogether. For example, national officials frequently pledge to care for people with HIV, yet local hospitals often hesitate to admit such patients. These hospitals fear either that they will have to compensate people who acquired the virus through blood transfusions at their hospital or that awareness of the disease's presence will deter local investment. Hospitals are negligent in other ways as well; for example, some do not offer HIV tests while others deliberately misdiagnose in an attempt to cover up HIV's presence. In fact, some health officials say that the Chinese governmental system itself makes it impossible to effectively combat HIV/AIDS, arguing that the central government has the means to curb the epidemic…but the control and corruption inherent in a one-party system prevent courts and state-run news media from uncovering abuses. 25 Here, an interesting contradiction emerges: earlier, this paper showed that the media has been helpful in disseminating information about HIV/AIDS, yet these examples show the media's power to withhold information as well. Again, the idea that knowledge is crucial to stopping the epidemic is central, for unless people are made aware of local negligence, these abuses will persist.

Finally, one of the most difficult challenges the government faces is in erasing stigmas about HIV/AIDS patients. People suffering from HIV/AIDS are often feared and discriminated against because HIV/AIDS is viewed as an 'indecent' disease. 26 A recent survey by the China Social Survey Firm reveals the extent of this stigmatization; 75% of respondents said they avoided people with HIV/AIDS, while 45% asserted that the disease was a consequence of moral degeneration.27 The impact of this shunning is enormous: some HIV/AIDS patients are refused admission to hospitals because they carry the disease,28 others are unable to access employment, housing, and state services.29 This discrimination also has profound social and psychological effects, propelling AIDS sufferers into extreme social and psychological isolation at a time when they need support the most. 30 And, this stigmatization discourages people from seeking testing and treatment, allowing HIV to spread even further.31

Though the overwhelming social stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS sufferers poses a potent challenge, the government has made considerable efforts to address it. Recent legislation has attempted to safeguard the basic rights of HIV/AIDS patients. For example, a law that came into effect on March 1, 2006, stated: Any working unit and individual should not discriminate against HIV carriers, AIDS patients or their families. The legal rights of marriage, job, studying and receiving medical treatment should be under the protection of law. 32 Additionally, the government has made simpler – but perhaps equally powerful – symbolic gestures designed to reduce the stigma surrounding the disease. Senior political figures have become actively involved in anti-discrimination campaigns, hoping to dispel common myths, such as the belief that HIV can be transmitted through casual contact. On December 1, 2003 (World AIDS Day), Wen Jiabao publicly shook hands with AIDS patients in Beijing.33 This act, though seemingly minor, was a powerful way to dispel a common misperception about HIV. Though overwhelming social stigmas remain, acts like this suggest that political leaders are becoming increasingly dedicated to erasing such discrimination.

International Collaboration
Though China faces serious challenges in coping with its HIV/AIDS epidemic, it does not face them alone. Indeed, HIV/AIDS in China is actually a global problem. As Hamburg explains, As the epidemic expands, issues of transmission across borders with adjacent nations have begun to emerge as a potential source of conflict and concern. 34 In an age of increasing globalization, the health problems of one country become the health problems of the world. Thus, when analyzing efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic, an assessment of the ways in which China has collaborated with and received assistance from other countries, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is also crucial.

Assistance from IGOs has been integral to China's efforts to halt the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly with regard to knowledge dissemination. For example, in its Goals for China, the United Nations pledges to assist the government in the development of a communication strategy to increase public awareness about HIV/AIDS and to design…comprehensive and appealing mass media campaigns about the disease as well.35 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has also assumed an active role in the fight against HIV/AIDS in China. For example, Kanabus and Noble explain that UNICEF has supported innovative education and prevention projects in ethnic minority languages that aim to draw on traditional educational practices to transmit HIV/AIDS information around the borderlands. In Yunnan, UNICEF printed posters and educational materials in the Tai alphabet, an alphabet not officially endorsed by the government.36 Thus, with its educational campaigns, UNICEF acknowledges the importance of educating those traditionally ignored by Chinese government campaigns. Additionally, by working in the border regions, UNICEF helps minimize instances of cross-border transfers of HIV/AIDS to and from nearby Burma, Laos, and Thailand.

NGOs have also played pivotal roles in HIV/AIDS education and prevention campaigns in China. In 2005, the government of Yunnan province formed a partnership with the Clinton Foundation to combat the spread of HIV and AIDS in the area. 37 Additionally, the Safe Blood International Foundation, an American nonprofit organization, also joined forces with China's Health Ministry in 2005. Safe Blood has since worked to improve the blood supply in Yunnan and Henan, a vital goal if China is to make any headway in tackling not only HIV but hepatitis. 38 The Chinese government's willingness to work with these organizations is a sign of its evolving attitude toward HIV/AIDS. As Bruce Einhorn writes, The news [of partnerships with the Clinton Foundation and Safe Blood] is significant because for many years, China was unwilling to admit the scope of its HIV problem. As a result, asking for help – let alone from the U.S. – was unthinkable. 39 Thus, increased openness from government officials has not only allowed the Chinese public to become better educated about the disease, but it has also been instrumental in securing international assistance.

This international assistance has also come in the form of financial and technical assistance from various foreign governments. Accepting this aid has allowed China to greatly expand its resource base and to learn important lessons about what works and what doesn't from countries that are further along the epidemic trajectory. 40 Though exchanges of money and of knowledge have benefited China, there are also several opportunities for China to increase its international partnerships. For example, Yunnan province – which has the second-highest number of HIV/AIDS cases in China – is right next to the Golden Triangle heroin centers of Laos, Thailand, and Burma.41 As sex workers and drug users cross borders, all four countries are left vulnerable to the spread of HIV/AIDS. For instance, in Burma, there are major concerns about…border areas where drug use and the movement of labour is high. Along the eastern border with Thailand and the northern border with China the incidence of HIV has already reached epidemic proportions. 42 Though the concentration of drug users in these border areas poses a distinct challenge, it also offers an opportunity for China to collaborate with its neighbors on policies that would reduce the instances of HIV/AIDS in the entire region. For example, the Chinese government could cooperate with neighboring governments to reach out to drug users in the area, perhaps through educational campaigns or needle exchange programs.

In both its reconfiguration of domestic policy and in its interactions with international organizations, China's government has demonstrated an awareness that increased openness about HIV/AIDS is the first key to successfully curbing the spread of the disease. On the domestic front, the recent trend of leaders acknowledging and discussing the HIV/AIDS epidemic set the tone for a variety of domestic reforms. These changes, such as increased education and prevention campaigns and a variety of new legislation, have further emphasized the value of educating the public about HIV/AIDS and removing the social stigma that has long surrounded the disease. Additionally, government officials' willingness to acknowledge the problem of HIV/AIDS has also allowed them to accept foreign aid from a variety of sources, including IGOs, NGOs, and foreign countries. These domestic policy changes and new international avenues of collaboration have been welcome developments. However, the HIV/AIDS crisis still looms large in China; in 2007, the government revealed that the number of new AIDS cases had risen 45% from the year before.43 These startling figures suggest that the government cannot afford to be satisfied with its current policies. Though increased openness and policy reforms have produced modest gains, they have not solved the problem. Rather than be satisfied with its recent achievements, the Chinese government must continue to increase openness about HIV/AIDS, to educate its citizens, and to implement its new policies. Only through a serious commitment to these goals will China ever be able to effectively address the problem of HIV/AIDS.",0,46.19,51.48,57.05,22026
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,"Space, Class, and Party—Critical Tools of Democratization in Nicaragua","I. INTRODUCTION
In 1990, amidst an environment of exploitation, revolution, violence, and harsh dictatorship, the people of Nicaragua shifted their support behind Violeta Chamorro, a democratic and conservative candidate. Without the theoretical prerequisites of democratization, the poor electorate was able to peacefully transition their government from the socialist Sandinistas to a developing democracy. Although democracy would seem unlikely in the Nicaraguan context, Leslie E. Anderson and Lawrence C. Dodd argue in their book, Learning Democracy: Civic Engagement and Electoral Choice in Nicaragua, 1990-2001, that democracy, Developed through the emergence of three specific historical conditions: political space, conscious class difference, and strong political parties, with these conditions emerging in a context that would seem antithetical to democracy (42). Specifically, they believe space, class, and party interacted with one another to allow the key democratic conditions of inclusion and contestation to flourish—two of Dahl's preconditions for democracy to develop. This paper clarifies that Anderson and Dodd see space, class, and party as historical developments that were used as tools for democratic foundation; once democracy was established, the inclusivity and contestation afforded by democratization allowed space, class, and party to evolve according to the people of Nicaragua's values, effectively strengthening the quality of democracy.

II. HISTORICAL ROOTS OF DEMOCRACY: SPACE, CLASS, AND PARTY
A. Colonial Roots of Space, Class, and Party
While space, class, and party were the essential components that created a foundation for democracy in Nicaragua, they evolved slowly over the centuries. Anderson and Dodd believe these concepts were first developed in colonial times, explaining the tumultuous experience of the native population under Spanish rule, Produced disagreement, protest, and rebellion, and with them the beginning of political space for contestation (44). Native unrest created a space for contestation, which allowed class divisions to emerge as issues to contend over. The larger, poorer segment of the population rebelled against the smaller, more affluent population of Spanish landlords. While space was initially created for more popular dissent, space was also created for contestation amongst the elites, which was fought through division of political camps into the Liberal and Conservative parties. Space for parties was critical as, The formation of elite disagreement into political parties brought to Nicaragua a distinct advantage that would later favor democratization (45). While the development of space, class, and party in colonial times did not allow for greater freedoms amongst the people, they served as critical tools that would teach the importance of contestation and inclusivity to the popular consciousness—creating a greater foundation for democratization in the future.

B. Space, Class, and Party under Somocismo
Although the Somoza regime kept Nicaragua in a dictatorship from 1936-1979, the traditions of space, class, and party still existed. Regarding space, The Somozas could restrict but not eliminate the voices of political dissent against the authoritarian dynasty. Nor could they eliminate the secret public spaces where dissent was nourished and spread. Popular contestation stood muted but not stifled (51). This was accomplished through forums of opposition outside the dictatorship—which were expressed through class and party lines. As an oppressed group, the peasantry clung to the small spaces of opposition, using Sandino as a popular figure and learning the value of contestation and inclusivity this space provided. The authoritarian regime also redefined the party system, altering the perception of the Conservative party as, The less extreme […] of the two elite political parties (52). The popularity of the traditional parties would increase by the end of the century—UNO, a coalition Conservative-Liberal party, became a more appealing option in 1990 as it promoted the civil liberties denied during the dictatorial oppression of the Somozas. It is ironic that while the authoritarian Somoza regimes attempted to clamp down on civil society through corruption and wealth concentration, leading to massive poverty, they inadvertently created an opposition that would strengthen the preconditions for democracy. Continuing the traditions of space, class, and party under such stringent regimes actually reinforced these tools, allowing for a stronger foundation for a transition to democracy in 1990.

C. Space, Class, and Party under the Sandinistas
Anderson and Dodd argue the space, class, and party developed most through Sandinista rule and allowed for inclusivity, which Gave citizens the beginning of the democratic requisites scholars have described as necessary for democratization (57). Under Ortega, class and space were empowered, specifically as these issues related to the majority of poor that existed within Nicaragua. Class was transformed through land redistribution, as land reforms aimed, To transform the rural social class structure by extending access of the landless and near-landless to land and work (59). By empowering the lower classes, Ortega was able to inculcate a critical prerequisite for democracy—inclusivity. Further, new spaces were created throughout Nicaragua that would empower sectors of society that were formerly excluded. This was accomplished through the creation of unions of groups such as peasants and women. More scholars agree that the Sandinista efforts provided the groundwork for democracy vis-à-vis inclusive participation. Luis Serra agreed, The grassroots organizations served as important channels for the democratic expression of popular interests, while Gary Ruchwarger felt the mass organizations under Sandinista rule served as, Schools of democracy (64). However, an essential lesson in democracy was undermined by Sandinista rule—contestation. Multi-party development was not encouraged under the unilateral rule of the Sandinistas, who held a general election in 1984 only at the behest of international pressure. This election drew upon, The democratic foundations of political space, class politics, and parties […] and encouraged contestation and participation as formulated by Dahl (65). The Sandinistas created tools of their own demise as the space, class, and party they developed would be utilized by the masses to create social agency, allowing them to transition into a more conservative democracy through electoral choice. The space, class, and party developed under Sandinista rule strengthened democratic foundations, allowing for democracy to emerge in a country that did not possess the theoretical prerequisites of democracy like affluence and urbanization. Instead, as Anderson and Dodd suggest, the working class and peasantry were able to use the social resources of space, class politics, and party in place of affluence to induce contestation and inclusivity, creating a basis for democratization.

III. THE EVOLUTION OF SPACE, CLASS, AND PARTY
A. Evolution of Space after 1990
As democracy took shape after the 1990 election, the tool of space was able to evolve further, strengthening democracy in the region. This was apparent through the public's reaction to Chamorro's initial economic reforms. Although the people voted for a conservative, democratic government believing it would alleviate the woes created by the radical Sandinistas, Chamorro's economic reforms actually intensified domestic poverty. In response, The very citizens who had elected Chamorro moved to curb her policies once she was in power, uniting in mobilized opposition (212). As an accountable, democratic government, Chamorro listened to her constituents by moderating, although not stopping, these economic reforms. By voting in a democratic government, the people were allowed a more open space for contestation and inclusive participation that the government would more effectively respond to. Throughout the nineties, The political space for contestation and participation expanded to include a more meaningful role for democratic institutions (215). This action secured and formalized the political space that was more vulnerable in the past. Not only did space create the foundation for democracy, but democratic governance helped evolve the role of political space, effectively improving the quality of democracy.

B. Evolution of Class after 1990
Although class politics were an essential component in bringing a democratic, conservative government to power, the transition to democracy initially weakened the power of the poorer classes. Anderson and Dodd explain that upon the transition, Nicaraguans faced the long-term implications of their choice: the transition to a market economy and the loss of the Sandinista social safety net (213). A market economy and the elimination of Sandinista social services led to greater inequality amongst class wherein the majority poor populous became increasingly subordinate to more affluent elites. Under Chamorro, Not only were there more poor citizens, [but] poor citizens were considerably poorer (220). Although class inequality continued, Chamorro remained popular as her regime still afforded the people their political space. The fact that Chamorro remained popular through her governance implies that the Nicaraguan people put more value on their civil liberties created through space, leading to inclusivity and contestation, than on the economic hardships created out of class inequality. The theoretical quality of democracy was weakened by class inequality, but to the people of Nicaragua the quality of democracy was high as their values, specifically civil liberties, were supported and promoted by the government.

C. Evolution of Party after 1990
Party politics evolved after 1990 through the reemergence of traditional political parties; this created contestation amongst political elites, causing them to pander to the values of the populous, thereby strengthening the quality of democracy. By the middle of the nineties, Nicaragua's party system had begun to resemble the 'two and a half party systems' that occasionally arise in established democracy (224). In 1996, the two main parties people identified with were the Sandinistas and the traditional Liberal party. The half party was identified as the Conservatives while 22.7 percent of the population still identified themselves as independent. The fact that more than one-fifth of the population was not loyal to a party would force the more major parties to contend over issues salient to the public. To engage the public, the traditional parties would promote a, Regime devoted to civil liberties and democratic process, then all classes could unite behind a rightist candidate of democratic conservatism. By contrast, an election centering on social policies could generate a class-based result beneficial to the Sandinistas (224). Mindful of the cross-class value of civil liberties, the traditional parties contended in a political space over this issue. By battling over an issue so significant to the majority of the public a sense of inclusivity was created, effectively increasing the quality of democracy in Nicaragua.

IV. CONCLUSION
On a theoretical basis, the environment in Nicaragua was inadequate for democratization to occur; however, the historical evolution of space, class, and party under oppressive and revolutionary regimes allowed democracy to develop in the nation. Anderson and Dodd support space, class, and party as the essential components to democratization in Nicaragua, arguing, A country with strong foundations of space, class, and party, whether derived through gradualist evolution or social revolution, has most of the domestic conditions necessary for rapid learning of electoral democracy (32). A long history of repression and radical revolution has taught the people of Nicaragua the value of democracy. Through the informal contestation and inclusivity that was cultivated through their history, the people of Nicaragua were finally able to vote in a government that supported their vital value—civil liberties. Though democratic conservatism may have hindered class equality, the people still supported this rule as the evolution of spatial inclusivity and party contestation afforded the public the cherished liberties they were denied throughout a shared history of oppression. Anderson and Dodd use space, class, and party as conditions in Nicaragua to show that when, Mobilized politics combine with genuine electoral competition, […] the poor and poorly educated can engage in extensive citizen participation and serious vote choice, thereby taking their fate and that of their nation into their own hands (33). By using space, class, and party as tools to support Dahl's democratic prerequisites of inclusivity and contestation, Anderson and Dodd show that Nicaragua is not an anomaly—instead, it is a case that provides an alternative theoretical explanation of how democratization can develop and the quality of democracy can improve in a nation without the standard prerequisites for the transition to democracy.",0,0,0,0,13266
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Implications of Georgian NATO membership for the South Caucasus,"In a speech made in November 2005, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared that the door is open for Georgian membership.1 Although recent events in the country have cast doubt on the strength of government institutions and President Mikheil Saakashvili's commitment to democracy, NATO and American officials insist that Georgia will almost certainly become a member in due time. In order to become a member state, Tbilisi must make military and political reforms. However, the extent of these changes and the long-term commitment of the Georgian government to reform remain to be seen. Should Georgia join NATO, it will represent a significant shift of power in the Caucasus. The change in status will have repercussions for each state in the Caucasus.

The two key issues that will be affected by Georgian entry into NATO are its internal secessionist conflicts and its testy relations with Russia. To the Georgian government, the two issues are one and the same. They believe that Russia is the root of separatist movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Tbilisi alleges that Russia supplies secessionists with arms, money, and refuge.2 Georgia also accuses Russia of promoting secessionist sentiment in order to gain influence by rushing to Tbilisi's rescue with military bases and peacekeeping troops. The Georgian government hopes that NATO membership will prevent Russian interference in Georgian affairs, thereby also breaking the back of the secessionist movements. Although this stance will likely prevent overt Russian interference, it may be oversimplified, and it also bears a degree of danger.

Russian disengagement from Abkhazia and South Ossetia may provoke separatists. Russia supplies the breakaway regions with heavily subsidized fuel, and Russian peacekeepers make important contributions to the local economies.3 There was a great deal of dissatisfaction among Ajarian merchants due to the loss of steady customers when the Russian military base in Batumi closed. Furthermore, the Abkhaz and South Ossetians view Russia as their guardian, and a Russian withdrawal will make them upset, particularly if Georgian forces replace them. Russia has also extended citizenship and issued passports to many Abkhaz and Ossetians.4 Moscow could raise a ruckus if it claims that Georgia is not respecting the rights of its citizens. Having Abkhaz and Ossetian citizens, along with ethnic Russians living in Georgia, gives Russia a reason to intervene in Georgian affairs. One positive aspect of NATO membership for Georgia in this regard is that Russian intervention on behalf of Abkhaz, Ossetians, and ethnic Russians will take the form of political, economic, or diplomatic action rather than the use of force.

If Russian forces leave Abkhazia and South Ossetia, they will not be replaced by Western forces. NATO officials have made it clear that although they may be willing to consider Georgia for membership without its internal conflicts resolved, it will not become involved in their resolution. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will be the only international organization charged with resolving the disputes.5 This may not prevent NATO from becoming involved in the conflicts. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon recently criticized the Georgian government for constructing two new NATO-standard military bases within miles of the Abkhaz and Ossetian borders.6 These bases are currently being used only by Georgian units, but should NATO forces be stationed there, it could be seen as a tacit sign of Western support for Georgian military operations in the area.

Figure here
This map details the location of closed Russian military bases, as well as the Russian base at Gudauta which Russia claims is closed, but refuses to allow inspectors to verify this. The white boxes indicate the location of newly constructed NATO-standard Georgian military bases.

One concern that has been raised by analysts is the prospect of hostilities between NATO and Russian forces. The Kremlin recently announced that they would raise two elite alpine brigades and station them in the mountains along Russia's border with Georgia in response to the increasing Western interest in Georgia.7 In Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, NATO has placed a high priority on securing the airspace of its members. Georgian officials routinely accuse Russian aircraft of violating Georgian airspace, most notably in the recent missile incident in the north of the country. The Georgian air force is not equipped with aircraft capable of intercepting Russian jets, so the responsibility for securing the skies over Georgia will fall to NATO aircraft. Additionally, Moscow has already lodged complaints with the US over intelligence-gathering flights along Georgia's northern border. American U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and AWACS radar intelligence aircraft have been flying sorties from Georgia for several years.8 While it is unlikely that either side will resort to open combat, it is possible that an event like the China spy plane incident will occur. That incident occurred when an American surveillance aircraft was intercepted by two Chinese jets on the border of their airspace, and amidst the aerial posturing, a Chinese jet and the surveillance aircraft collided, killing the Chinese pilot, causing the American crew to fall into Chinese hands, and sparking an international incident. Additionally, the Russian air force has recently become much more confrontational with the West. Russian bombers have flown missions over Scotland and an US carrier group in the Pacific, and Russian fighter jets have been sent to intercept NATO aircraft flying well within international airspace. The prospect of aerial confrontations between Russian and NATO aircraft must be taken into consideration should Georgia join NATO.

Russian officials have expressed their deep concerns about American strategic objectives in Georgia. Several senior Russian officers have suggested that the US intends to station components of a missile defense shield in Georgia. Although the Bush administration has asked the Czech Republic to host an anti-missile radar system, it has also indicated that it would like to station a radar base in the Caucasus, ostensibly to track Iranian missiles.9 Of course, Georgia does not need to be a member of NATO to host the American project. Agreeing to host the radar site will tie Georgia more closely to the US, and will likely improve its chances of gaining NATO membership.

These military developments will impact Georgia in a number of ways. In terms of Georgian foreign relations, its relationship with Russia has already deteriorated, and will deteriorate farther should Georgia become a NATO member. This breakdown in relations will likely result in border tensions, both on the ground and in the air. Although NATO officials have stated that they will not become directly involved in the breakaway regions, the military assistance and reforms that the Georgian military must undergo to join NATO will put Tbilisi in a much stronger position to deal with the breakaway regions, whether through negotiations or through force. Additionally, the removal of Russian forces from Georgia, coupled with NATO's mutual protection guarantee, will diminish Russia's ability to influence Georgian affairs.

Politically, many members of NATO have expressed their reservations about democracy in Georgia. Although the 2003 Rose Revolution endeared the country to many Western politicians, President Saakashvili has become increasingly authoritarian. The recent declaration of emergency rule by Tbilisi led to a statement by Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer that the imposition of Emergency Rule, and the closure of media outlets in Georgia, a Partner with which the Alliance has an Intensified Dialogue, are of particular concern and not in line with Euro-Atlantic values. 10 Western officials have also expressed doubts about the fairness of elections in Georgia, along with a number of human rights concerns. Significantly, while NATO statements on the membership process in 2003 and 2004 highlighted military standards and compatibility with Western forces as the biggest obstacle to overcome, updates on Georgia's progress towards membership lately have expressed that democracy and human rights are the biggest concern. Specifically, NATO officials have stressed the need for free and fair elections, as well as strong democratic institutions (particularly an independent judiciary) in Georgia.11

These concerns may cause changes in Tbilisi. Saakashvili has already made reforms in order to placate NATO. It remains to be seen, however, whether these reforms have any real substance. An English-language website set up by the Georgian government for members of the Western media trumpets a variety of economic, security, judicial, legislative, and environmental reforms. In the area of security, much detail is given to the overhaul of the police forces, anticorruption initiatives among military and law enforcement officials, restructuring the Georgian military, and improving training.12 Interestingly, many of the reforms that were intended to limit corruption and streamline the command structure of security forces did so by placing them under the direct command of the president. Significantly, although the press releases speak glowingly of democratic progress in Georgia, the details of democratic reform are vague. In response to the findings of an advisory committee hired by the Georgian government, Tbilisi promises to improve the power of parliamentary committees and liaisons, and makes a vague promise to improve public access to information. As for judicial reform, a major concern of NATO, the government promises to increase the number of courts and judges, remove the right of original jurisdiction from the Court of Cassation (the highest court in Georgia), improve the quality of lawyers, and increase judges' pay.13

Some analysts have suggested that the likelihood of any meaningful move towards democracy in Georgia is slim. Thomas de Waal writes in Internationale Politik that the leaders of the South Caucasian countries take steps towards introducing some reforms, while taking care that nothing they do threatens their own survival. They hang onto their membership in the Council of Europe by holding elections that, although not fully fair, are not so outrageous as to earn them the threat of expulsion. 14 In the same article, de Waal points out Saakashvili's Janus-face. To foreigners, he presents the image of an idealistic democrat, focused on rooting out corruption and dedicated to peace. Yet at home Saakashvili is a staunch nationalist who is not particularly tolerant of ethnic minorities, or of dissenting voices. Saakashvili's announcement this week that he would resign as president in order to stand for re-election is an example of this. Although he is acting in accordance with Georgian law by resigning, which is intended to prevent an incumbent president from interfering on his own behalf in an election, it is very likely that he will again be president after the election. Although the headline the on the BBC reads Georgian leader resigns for poll, 15 further down in the text of the article are references to Saakashvili's decision to shut down an independent television station, as well as his nine day declaration of emergency rule. Even though Saakashvili is giving up the title of president, he and his supporters have already set things into motion that will make him the president again.

To be cynical however, it is important to note that NATO's ideological commitment to democracy is not absolute. Both Turkey and Greece have experienced several military coups while NATO members, and neither country faced expulsion or other serious penalties. There have been a few parties that have called for greater discipline and penalties for NATO member states when it comes to democratic practices, particularly in light of NATO's expansion east into the former Soviet Union. However, these voices are few and scattered. Practical considerations, such as Georgia's strategic location close to Russia, Iran, and the Caspian oil fields, will doubtlessly play a role in how far NATO will pressure Tbilisi to make genuine reforms.

Lastly, Georgia will make some economic gains from joining NATO. Georgia is in some ways naturally inclined to Western trade, due to its Black Sea ports. Georgian ports on the Black Sea enable the country to trade with NATO members Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, as well as the Mediterranean countries past the Turkish Straits. Georgia could find new markets for its products there. It is fortunate that Georgia has both land and sea links to the west, because economic relations with Russia have suffered greatly as a result of Tbilisi's cozying up to the West. Russia has banned the importation of some Georgian goods, notably wine. During crises, such as the 2006 incident where Georgia seized four Russian military officers on suspicion of being spies, Russia has shown a willingness to halt trade with Georgia. The border was closed, flights to Tbilisi were cancelled, and the Duma passed a bill to ban money transfers to Georgia.16

Economic reforms, including lowering taxes, deregulation, and the privatization of government-owned businesses are helping to integrate the Georgian economy into the West. These efforts have yielded results. The World Bank named Georgia as the world's top reforming country in 2006, and the country recently was ranked the eighteenth-best country in the world to run a business in.17 It is very likely that Saakashvili will remain dedicated to economic reform, given his country's economic growth and the fact that economic reform does not threaten his hold on power. Between Tbilisi's economic reforms and the building hostility of Russia towards Georgia as a result of its NATO bid, Georgia is becoming economically tied to the West. In the future, a NATO-oriented Georgia will likely develop close economic ties with the West, will witness a decrease in the importance of trade of Russia, and will experience an influx of foreign investment. Georgia will move beyond the Caucasus and become part of a global economy.

If Georgia becomes a NATO member, it will have significant implications for neighboring Armenia and Azerbaijan. Although Georgia has friendly relations with both countries, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, coupled with the each country's relationship with regional powers, makes the situation more complex. NATO has approached all three countries and invited them to participate in a number of programs, including pre-membership programs. All three countries have participated in the Individual Partnership Action Plan and Partnership for Peace programs, which establish bilateral ties between individual states and NATO.18 NATO involvement in the Caucasus beyond basic cooperation agreements varies, however. While Georgia has enthusiastically embraced a path to NATO membership, Armenia has ruled out becoming a member state, and Azerbaijan has not definitively declared one way or the other.19 These differences will influence the stance that NATO takes towards each country, and the potential impact that Georgian membership will have on the Caucasus.

Armenia in particular will be affected by Georgian membership in NATO. Should Georgia become a member state, it will enable the West to influence Armenia. This will lead to a change in the region's dynamics. Armenians tend to consider Russia to be their protector, even if it is sometimes less than reliable. President Kocharyan has stressed that developing ties with the West will not harm Armenia's relationship with Russia. However, in terms of security and geography, maintaining ties with both could be difficult. Armenia is geographically isolated from Russia, and the growing Western influence in Georgia and Azerbaijan could spill over into the country.

Should conflict resume with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh or the Armenian-occupied territory in western Azerbaijan, Armenia could be at a distinct disadvantage. Russia is the primary supplier of arms to Armenia. If Georgia joins NATO, the West could urge Tbilisi to forbid the movement of Russian arms through Georgian territory and airspace. Western countries may have an interest in preventing the movement of Russian arms to Armenia. The West may look favorably at the opportunity to dent the Russian arms export business. It is also possible that some countries may seek to pressure Armenia into moving closer to the West by cutting them off from Russian support. Most importantly, if Armenia threatens the flow of Azerbaijani oil (which is a primary goal of the Armenian military should open conflict resume20) the West will be very anxious to ensure that its flow is uninterrupted. If Georgia's borders are closed to Russian arms, Armenia's options will be extremely limited. Azerbaijan obviously will not permit arms destined for Armenia to pass, and Turkey, out of historical animosity, solidarity with the Azerbaijanis, and allegiance to NATO, likely will not allow Russian weapons to move through its territory or airspace either. This would leave the Armenians with the unpleasant choice of flying or shipping arms from Russia around the Caucasus and up through Iran's narrow border with Armenia. This could dramatically change the balance of power between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly if Azerbaijani forces could seize the corridor between southwestern Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan, thereby cutting off Armenia from Iran.

Azerbaijan will also be affected by Georgian entry into NATO. NATO investment in Georgia increases the security and confidence in the oil pipeline that runs from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey. Azerbaijan's oil reserves guarantee that the West will attempt to maintain good relations with Baku, even if their democratic record is less than stellar. The lavish welcome that President Bush put on for Aliyev when he made a state visit to Washington DC last year points to the high standing of Azerbaijan in the West.21 The high price of oil also guarantees the Azerbaijani government quite a bit of money, giving the country a degree of insulation against outside coercion. The disadvantage of being an oil supplier for the West is that will put Azerbaijan directly into competition with Russia. That may also drive Azerbaijan closer to the West as its profile builds in the region.

The Azerbaijani government has been noncommittal on the issue of NATO membership. President Ilham Aliyev may consider the issue of NATO membership to be leverage in negotiations with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azerbaijani territory held by Armenian forces. Although Azerbaijan joining NATO would give the country a definite advantage against Armenia, it would be a risky proposition. Azerbaijan is certainly a less than democratic country, and the reforms that NATO would require from President Aliyev would most likely be asking too much of him. Additionally, Azerbaijan enjoys relatively friendly relations with Iran, which would obviously be harmed by NATO membership. Baku does not want to act as a staging area for military action against Iran. The fact that there is a sizable Azeri population in northern Iran also is a factor, as Aliyev will come under domestic pressure if Azeris are killed in an attack. It is also possible that Tehran would retaliate, either against Azerbaijan or against the Iran's Azeri population if a strike is launched from Azerbaijani territory.

Despite Russia's traditional role as the dominant power in the Caucasus, it is very likely that it will have to be content, at best, with sharing influence in the future. Although neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan have been enthusiastic about applying for NATO membership, it is likely that they will be drawn further into the Western sphere of influence. In Armenia's case, physical isolation from Russia and Western influence from its neighbors will become a prominent factor in its policies. Armenia will still likely maintain strong ties with Russia though. Azerbaijan's future is staked on the Caspian—Georgia—Turkey pipeline. The pipeline will tie Azerbaijan to Georgia and Turkey, along with all of the NATO members receiving the product. It also makes Azerbaijan a serious contender in the oil export market, which puts it in Russia's crosshairs. Having Russia as an economic competitor may push Baku closer to NATO. The benefits of increased Western trade with Georgia should also spill over into Armenia and Azerbaijan, creating more ties between the South Caucasus and the West.

Detractors of the NATO plan to expand into Georgia claim that it would create a miniature cold war in the Caucasus. Yet many historians and political scientists now believe that the Cold War standoff was actually quite stable, and even beneficial in some ways.22 In a bipolar system, the two powers tend to balance each other out. If the leaders of the South Caucasus states are wily enough, they could take advantage of the absence of one clear regional power. Like Egypt during the Cold War, they could play both the US and Russia for their own benefit, leaning one way or the other as their needs suit them.

Although there are many uncertainties about the effect of Georgia entering into NATO, there are many indications that it may destabilize the region. Georgian relations with Russia will mostly likely deteriorate severely. Armenia and Azerbaijan will be influenced to varying degrees by the growing Western presence. Conflict may become more likely, whether between Georgia and separatists, NATO and Russia, NATO and Iran, or Armenia and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, one could argue that one man's stability is another man's oppression. Having NATO in the Caucasus could loosen Russia's hold on the region, and reduce the political and economic dependency of the Caucasus states.",91.67,83.76,60.08,39.22,22041
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Political Realignment in the South,"A nation as large and diverse as America must certainly face a multitude of social and political problems. From debates over war and national security to disagreements over social security and healthcare coverage, the clash of ideas and ideologies on this country's socio-political stage never ends. However, despite the emergence of hundreds of new, controversial issues over the past few decades, no issue has remained as persistently relevant and explosive as race. Perhaps owing to America's history as a nation of immigrants, willing and forced, segments within our population remain distinct, holding individual ideologies and values. Though some may deny that racism still exists in this country, and indeed one rarely encounters its most explicit, institutionalized forms today, our nation is far from color blind. On the political front, our differences remain profound. In 2004, about 69 percent of African American voters identified with the Democratic party whereas only 35 percent of the total electorate fell into this category (Winneg and Jamieson, 581). Clearly, there is a difference in the manifestations of political beliefs among black and white voters. This difference becomes especially sizable in the South (identified here as the 11 states of the old Confederacy), where white voters have significantly moved away from the Democratic party in favor of the Republican party since the early 1960's. Once dominant in the South, the Democratic party no longer controls the majority of southern states because a massive party realignment occurred between 1964 and 2000. Having supported civil rights in the 1960's, busing to achieve integration of public schools in the 1970's, and affirmative action in the 1980's, the Democrats no longer reflected the racial attitudes of the majority of the white southern electorate. Many factors played a role in this ideological realignment, but the Democrats lost the South not simply because of liberal agendas or ideological rifts, but because of the concrete issue of race.

To analyze the intricacies of this realignment argument and to prove its racial nature, this discussion must begin by assaying the fallout from the Civil War. Whether for ideological or, as historians often argued today, pragmatic reasons, President Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery with his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln was a Republican, the South considered slavery vital to its way of life, and thus support for Republicans in the South shrunk drastically after the Civil War. Though subsequent realignments occurred (1896, 1932, etc.), Democrats continued to dominate southern politics until about 1964. In that year, a significant turning point for political parties in America, about 66 percent of southerners officially considered themselves Democrats. This number dwindled slowly and dropped to 36 percent in 2000 (Flanigan and Zingale, 74). The change began with what Hanes Walton deems bold legislation of the Johnson Administration, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Open Housing Act of 1968. The Democratic Johnson administration strongly supported these bills and by doing so remade the historic character of the Democratic party on race (Walton, 37-38).

While some of the southerners that left the Democratic party became Republicans, many more chose to not officially identify with either party. While the Democratic party lost about 30 percent of its southern base between 1964 and 2000, only about six percent of this 30 percent felt ideologically inclined to join the Republican party. On the other hand, the number of independents in the South jumped from 15 percent in 1964 to 38 percent in 2000 (Flanigan and Zingale, 74). Some political scientists contend that southerners left the Democratic party because of an overall ideological shift, not specific grievances regarding race (Knuckley, 5, 11). However, this data shows that ex-Democratic southerners felt hesitant to officially join the Republican party even after leaving the Democrats, effectively defeating Knuckley's argument that southerners had an ideological rift with the Democrats. Given this data, a more logical argument would conclude that southerners felt unable to continue their support for the Democrats given the party's changed stance on racial issues (it had once supported slavery but had now become liberal on issues of race), yet they did not shift to the Republican party because they still did not agree with Republican ideology. An ideological rift did not occur, simply a disagreement with the Democrats on the vital issue of race which caused southerners to leave the party and become, by and large, independents. It is important to clarify here that although southerners who left the Democrats did not become Republicans in name, a realignment did occur because they overwhelmingly voted Republican from that time onwards. We must remember that though their ideology may not have been aligned with that of Republicans, their votes have taken Democrats out of power in the South and brought Republicans into power. Evidence for this lies in the fact that, as of 2003, Democrats had lost 64 percent of southern governorships, 59 percent of Senate seats and 56 percent of House seats that they held in 1951 (Black, 1006).

If racial attitudes alone split the majority of white southerners from the Democratic party, then this discussion must address the manifestations of racial attitudes both before and after the realignment. Racial attitudes in the South trace back to some of the nation's most pivotal moments: the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the events triggering the Civil War, and the wrenching abandonment of Jim Crow (Valentino and Sears, 673). These events left racial attitudes deeply ingrained in the minds of southern voters. Using these assumptions, Valentino and Sears seek to prove two things. First, white Southerners' votes and partisanship have become increasingly aligned with their racial attitudes since the Civil War. No similar increase exists for whites elsewhere in the country. Second, regional attitudes have a significantly stronger impact on white Southerners' partisanship than elsewhere. Moreover, this regional difference is not due simply to nonracial conservatism (675). Their findings prove both of these hypotheses true. They find that symbolic racism (measured by a four-question agree/disagree survey gauging attitudes of whites towards blacks), remains highest in the Deep South. More significantly, symbolic racism has fallen in all other parts of the country since 1994, but has actually risen in the Deep South (678). Valentino and Sears also note that though support for Jim Crow has declined nationwide since 1990, it remains highest in the Deep South.

These data indicate that racial attitudes remain most significant in the South, however, how can we prove that overall ideology did not also change and lead to the realignment? In the same survey, Valentino and Sears find party ideology in the South to be surprisingly similar to the North and West throughout the years of the realignment. They conclude:

Jim Crow or ""old fashioned"" racism has diminished drastically, but the South has retained slightly more of it than the rest of the country …White Southerners have consistently been more ideologically conservative than other whites over this period, but there has been no change in the size of that difference … Changes in these differences are therefore unlikely to account for the white Southern realignment over the past three decades. (678)

By this account, we can reasonably conclude that though the ideology of Southern Democrats of old remains more conservative than their counterparts in other parts of the country, this difference alone cannot account for their increased support for the Republican party. The Democratic party's changed stance on race drove white southerners away, even though on other issues, the Democrats remained a suitable choice.

Can just one single issue cause such a major shift in party identification, even if it is race? This thesis is supported by data from at least one other recent major realignment, that of Hispanic voters in California. In 1994, California's Proposition 187, which the state's Republican party supported, passed with 59 percent of the vote. California's Hispanic voters were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposition because of its anti-immigrant underpinnings (Bowler et al, 148-149). As recent events have shown us, immigration is a racial issue, and Bowler et al declare that the majority of Hispanics considered the proposition a racial issue (150). Before it passed, more Hispanic voters identified with the Republican party than Democrat, but this scenario was reversed after Proposition 187 passed (156-157). This example adds further proof to the theory of party realignment caused by the issue of race.

Though it may seem difficult to believe that one issue alone could cause voters to change their party identification, race is one example powerful enough to do it. Southerners have always been more ideologically conservative than voters in other parts of the country, but this ideology alone is insufficient in explaining their exodus from the Democratic to the Republican party since the early 1960's. Had the civil rights movement not brought the issue of race to the forefront, Democrats may have still held control over the South. Southern Democratic candidates remain adequately conservative to garner support from the southern white electorate, but their party's stand on the one issue of race continues to drive white voters toward Republicans. Ideology is important in determining voter identification, but some issues may at times override ideological leanings. Race, given its historically significant status in the foundations of the American social fabric, remains the foremost of such issues.",0,31.74,20.78,20.22,9958
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,China's Evolving Role in Peacekeeping,"On August 31st 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1706, calling for the expansion of the existing United Nations Mission in the Sudan to the devastated Darfur region.1 A notable achievement for the international community in its efforts to address the ongoing genocide within Darfur, this resolution also revealed a concurrent shift in China's views towards UN peacekeeping. The People's Republic did not vote in support of the resolution, but after two years of obstruction, the Chinese delegation chose to abstain rather than block the resolution's passage. This single instance illustrates multiple trends influencing China's evolving views of such matters, including the increasing benefits to China of participation and the increasing costs of opposition. In short, China has moved from a strongly skeptical opinion of international intervention to a more pragmatic outlook, balancing the traditional focus on state sovereignty with the need for stabilization abroad, domestic military development and international reputational benefits. This change in both doctrine and practice has important implications as China rises to great power status.

The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, during the formative years for United Nations peacekeeping operations and doctrine. Here a distinction should be drawn between peacekeeping, defined as military and civilian efforts to establish a secure environment in which to carry out peacebuilding activities, and peace enforcement, which is enforcement aimed at guaranteeing the implementation of a peace agreement or arrangement, including compliance, through judicious application of incentives and disincentives including military force. 2 Only peace enforcement is explicitly outlined, under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter.3 With the advent of the Cold War and the demise of any envisaged standing United Nations forces, the legal and practical conditions under which peacekeeping and peace enforcement might be undertaken had not yet been defined; in fact, the term peacekeeping itself did not come into use until 1956.4,5 Thus, it is important to remember that China's first direct experience with a United Nations military operation was the wholly atypical Korean War, in which a Soviet boycott of the Security Council allowed an American-led, United Nations-sanctioned force to enter the war in direct opposition to North Korea and, eventually, China itself.6 While most certainly not a peacekeeping operation in the current sense, this intervention strongly colored Chinese views of United Nations operations for decades. The experience in Korea combined with several other features of modern Chinese history, including foreign aggression in the 19th century, PRC exclusion from the United Nations in favor of the Republic of China and the Sino-Soviet split to create a deep mistrust of external powers and a belief that international interventions were simply covers for action taken by those strong enough to impose their will.7

However, the seating of the PRC on the Security Council in 1971 began a process of expanding engagement. After the launch of Deng's economic reforms in 1978 and subsequent growth in China's ties with the general international community, Chinese perceptions of peacekeeping became increasingly positive. The year 1981 saw China's first vote in favor of a peacekeeping action, and 1990 saw the country's first participation in a United Nations peacekeeping effort when Chinese military observers were sent to serve with the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East.8 Over the course of the beginning and middle of the last decade, China became steadily more involved in such actions, sending observers to locales such as Mozambique and Liberia and even providing troops for the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).9 Part of the credit for this development may be due to the overall explosion in UN peacekeeping operations in the post-Cold War period, but it is also clear that China made a strategic decision to involve itself in operations when feasible and low-risk, abandoning its earlier policies of strict non-involvement along with the command economy.

During the past ten years, China has continued and expanded upon this course. In its stated doctrine, China has taken on the role of a country that actively supports peacekeeping efforts. Materially, the PRC is the largest contributor to peacekeeping among the permanent Security Council members, although it still lags far behind the largest contributors to peacekeeping overall.10,11 A State Council white paper declares that, The United Nations' status and role in world affairs are being upheld and strengthened, and China observes the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, honors its international obligations, and participates in UN peacekeeping operations. 12 Of course, China has its own view of peacekeeping beyond simply participating, and remains decidedly cool to more interventionist approaches. Today, as in the past, China supports the application of Chapter I, Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter to peacekeeping doctrine: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 13 In practice, this means that China requires the full consent of any country before participating in peacekeeping operations of any kind. China has all along attached importance and rendered support to peacekeeping activities in accordance with the spirit of the UN Charter, said Chinese Major General Liu Pei, who added that the leading role of the Security Council must be strengthened and that peacekeeping activities can only be implemented when the conditions are right. 14 While this doctrine has been in place since China began to participate in peacekeeping efforts, the breathing room which it gives the PRC leadership in decision-making is important to recognize. Beijing has taken full advantage of this leeway over the past ten years. As long as peacekeepers enter into a state with the consent of that nation and do not become parties to the conflict, China has the ability to pick and choose which efforts it would like to support. To date, these have included such diverse countries as Haiti, Bosnia and Afghanistan in addition to those already mentioned above. A common motivating factor is lacking, however, and sheer benevolence is unlikely to provide a satisfactory explanation for Chinese choices. Instead, one must look to the general reasons for which the PRC backs peacekeeping operations to explain the connection between a permissive but non-interventionist Chinese doctrine and the nation's growing practical support.

First, and most clearly, China's international reputation is both increasingly important and increasingly at stake. Pang writes that, China's reputation as a major power in the UN has become an important national goal. Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, China has been pursuing its new role as a 'responsible power' with increasing confidence. 15 In 1997, China still strongly identified as a developing nation with little involvement in international diplomacy beyond its own borders. Since then, China has helped stabilize its region during the financial crisis, joined the World Trade Organization, become a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and taken on the role of a major player in the six-party talks aimed at defusing the North Korean nuclear issue. Chinese GNP has risen from $620 to $1,740 per capita from 1998 to 2005,16,17 and coastal cities and provinces are attaining levels of development approaching or even equaling the West. This increased involvement abroad and domestic development have combined with China's ballooning economic stature to put the country in the world spotlight, for good and for ill.

As a nation embarking on a self-proclaimed peaceful rise in economic, diplomatic and military terms, the PRC faces a constant struggle to convince others of its own benign intentions. Absent this goodwill on the part of the world community and especially the United States, China could certainly face larger barriers to trade, strengthening of the American system of bilateral alliances along its borders, or even a concerted and ongoing effort to contain the expansion of Chinese prosperity and power.18 In 2005, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick stated that, As it becomes a major global player, we are now encouraging China to become a ""responsible stakeholder"" that will work with the United States and others to sustain, adapt, and advance the peaceful international system that has enabled its success. 19 The PRC government has taken up the responsible stakeholder phrase as a desirable description of China and its developmental path. With increased pressure to support international standards of behavior and to promote conformity within the current system, leaders know that China must act in a way which strongly projects an image of benign influence.

To that end, China has indeed moved to become a responsible stakeholder in the field of UN peacekeeping over the last decade. This shift is easily observed in the pattern of Chinese deployments. Before 1997, China's major peacekeeping experience consisted of the deployment of 800 total troops and 97 observers as part of UNTAC.20 China underwrote the mission politically and financially in addition to its military contributions, but The involvement was not repeated in subsequent missions. 21 China's next mission contribution of more than 40 personnel did not occur until the UN Mission of Support in East Timor in 2000, but since that time, the UN has witnessed still greater Chinese involvement in its missions in the Congo, Liberia and now the Sudan.22 Whereas earlier major involvement was clearly focused on China's local neighborhood, support for recent interventions in Africa now takes center stage among Chinese operations. While hard to measure, this support may have plausibly brought some of the sought-after reputational benefits among local populations: as Thompson notes, Images of Chinese police officers and People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers wearing blue helmets and Chinese national flags project a positive image that dispels fears of a rising China. 23 Indeed, Chinese officials and government releases highlight these reputational aspects: Chinese peacekeeping forces have earned praise from the United Nations and from the government and people of host nations for their courage, perseverance, professionalism and discipline …, said Major General Liu.24 More importantly, practical support for peacekeeping has played into the U.S hopes for China as a stakeholder described above, demonstrating visible financial and military support for collective actions taken in support of peace.

More recently, China's involvement in the Sudan has given even greater weight to the argument that international reputational benefits are China's largest concern in increasing its peacekeeping involvement. Since 2003, conflict and admitted genocide have been decimating the Darfur region, addressed on the ground only through an ill-equipped 7,000 member African Union Mission in Sudan.25 Initially, Chinese, Russian and French interests all worked against Security Council action on the issue, but as pressure mounted, attention focused on persistent Chinese opposition to intervention.26 Most of the criticism has centered on China's oil ties to Sudan and the assumed link between energy supplies and its support for the Sudanese government on the Security Council. Finally, the pressure began to generate calls for an association between China's abetting genocide and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, an intended showpiece for China's modernization and development.27 Fearing permanent damage to the image of the Games, the PRC ultimately ratcheted down its support for Khartoum and abstained from the eventual vote on UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which allows any eventual peacekeepers the mandate to use all necessary means … to prevent attacks and threats against civilians, as well as expanding their deployment specifically to the Darfur region pending Sudan's consent.28 While the Chinese leadership may well have had other legitimate reasons for softening its stance, international censure and the threat of a major blow to prestige certainly had some effect. Since the Resolution's passage, China has committed to send a detachment of 315 engineers to Darfur, and the initially reluctant authorization of Resolution 1706 has already been appropriated by the leadership as an example of positive action on the part of the PRC. Again according to Liu, The Chinese government's active participation in peacekeeping in the Darfur region has won commendation and appreciation from relevant departments of the United Nations and from the international community. 29

Besides reputational concerns, the second major reason for China's changing actions over the last ten years is the PRC concern with stability, both in its own near abroad and in more distant areas of strategic importance. This stability has become inextricably linked to China's development and CCP legitimacy, which is predicated on globalization and reliable institutions in order to provide an environment for continued Chinese growth. As Lieberthal writes, China's grand strategy is designed both to sustain high speed economic development and to blunt any concerns that other countries may have about rapidly growing PRC capabilities. This strategy seeks to reduce to a minimum the chances that conflict abroad will disrupt the path to development at home; assure access to the raw materials, parts and components, and technology necessary to sustain China's unprecedented economic growth; and prevent developments in Taiwan from provoking either cross-Strait military conflict or a domestic political crisis in the PRC. 30 In order to reduce to a minimum chances for disruptive conflict abroad and assure access to raw materials, China has come to view United Nations peacekeeping as a useful tool. Access to raw materials often depends on the domestic stability of other nations, and this same stability helps ensure favorable conditions for international trade and investment. Admittedly, opportunities for peacekeeping mainly occur in smaller, resource poor states.31 Overall stability in such states, however, can produce positive externalities among states around them and eliminate the potentially massive negative externalities associated with war in any state. For instance, China's current assistance (182 engineers) to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon helps build peace and security in the most energy-critical region of the world, even if only in a limited fashion.32 The eventual acceptance of action in Sudan also falls into this category, as long-term stability in that country can only benefit Chinese access to Sudanese natural resources.

Finally, China has used peacekeeping not only as a carrot to induce cooperation but also as a stick, actively withdrawing support for peacekeeping as punishment for actions which violate core Communist Party interests such as the Taiwan issue. Two major cases outline this type of approach to peacekeeping. First, in Liberia, China's deployment of troops to Liberia shortly after it switched recognition from Taiwan to China was quickly followed up with aid packages that included food aid, motorcycles for the Liberian police force, a rebuilt sports complex, and even a US $2 million grant to help restructure the Liberian army and provide pensions and pay-outs for demobilizing troops. 33 This type of incentive to go along with Beijing's principles is highly visible to any of the other remaining countries which recognize the Republic of China. Second, in the case of the United Nations Preventative Deployment to Macedonia, China used its position on the Security Council to prematurely end one of the two most successful missions in Southeast Europe in 1999.34 This action came on the heels of Macedonian recognition of the Republic of China, which was subsequently switched to the People's Republic in 2001. In both of the above cases, Beijing has been able to use peacekeeping as a means to the end of securing diplomatic support for its own viewpoints and further isolating the Republic of China, arguably shifting Macedonia's behavior decisively simply through its power over peacekeeping and aid in the United Nations.

In a more minor case, Chinese involvement in Haiti may also have been related to Haiti's ongoing recognition of the ROC, but this is less clear. Thompson asserts that, China has recently [2004] provided over 100 riot police from the People's Armed Police (PAP) to the UN mission in Haiti [MINUSTAH], their only deployment in the Western hemisphere, and a nation that still recognizes Taiwan. While Haiti has not switched recognition from Taiwan to China, it can be assumed that this goal factored into China's decision to deploy police on that mission. 35 This assumption seems contradictory to China's earlier willingness to deny a country aid and peacekeeping involvement based on the Taiwan question as witnessed in Macedonia, as well as the positive feedback from Macedonia's subsequent compliance. Either Beijing's policy on the issue shifted between 1999 and 2004, or else Haiti possessed some outside set of factors inviting Chinese participation that outweighed any concerns over ROC recognition. Regardless, Haiti appears to be something of an outlier in Beijing's peacekeeping policy. Idealistically, China's involvement in MINUSTAH may represent an early example of Chinese peacekeeping for the sake of keeping the peace rather than a shrewdly calculated geopolitical maneuver. Realistically, the PRC support for this mission appears to be a miscalculation of potential benefits.

Each of the above justifications for expanding Chinese involvement in peacekeeping is important, but a final domestic matter both contributes to and feeds off this change. At the same time that China has found new reasons to support deployments diplomatically, it has been increasing its military capability to participate as needed and using UN operations as learning labs for the People's Liberation Army. Because China has not had occasion to deploy its armed forces externally since the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979, very few of its current personnel and equipment have field experience. This makes United Nations deployments especially attractive means to gain such experience in a diplomatically safe way. By 2002, the PLA was able to field One UN-standard engineering battalion, one UN-standard medical team and two UN-standard transport companies. Since that time, China also made its largest deployment ever of peacekeepers: 550 to Liberia.36 These increased capabilities have come during a period of unprecedented Chinese military expansion and modernization, an expansion that is coincident with China's growth into a legitimate international power during the past decade. From 2000 to 2005, even the PRC's own conservative numbers show Chinese defense expenditures as doubling, from $14.6 billion to $30.6 billion.37,38 While individual contributions to UN missions have been modest in military terms, they have helped the PLA to gain invaluable experience in coordinating with other militaries, to field-test equipment and to undergo rigorous and specialized UN training programs required for peacekeeping personnel.39 All of this has served to assist in China's drive to move the PLA from a primarily continental, numbers-based force to one that is more mobile, technologically advanced and able to respond rapidly throughout China's immediate region.40 At the same time, China's ongoing military transformation further increases its ability to participate in and even lead intensive UN peacekeeping operations.

Looking over the actions enumerated above, one clearly sees the trend of expansion in peacekeeping participation by China, a trend made possible by doctrinal changes of the 1980's but which only began in earnest during the mid-1990's. As China carries its military development and growing stature in international relations forward, a few different possibilities for longer-term peacekeeping policy present themselves. Based on the trajectory of the past ten years, some may seem more likely than others, but all appear plausible.

First, Beijing may simply continue as it is now, offering peacekeeping support where a clear national benefit exists and occasionally using its position on the Security Council to enforce unique Chinese perspectives. In this case, China would continue to maintain a lower overall profile than its economy and status as a veto-wielder might suggest. This outcome would play primarily off of acknowledgement that the United States will remain the dominant world power for the foreseeable future and that Beijing must therefore make pragmatic use of the tools available. Such a course would see China continue to support actions in nations with obvious impact on Chinese diplomatic, economic or energy interests.

Alternatively, China might expand its use of peacekeeping to help bring about closer contacts with other Asian nations and the West in addition to further bolstering its international reputation as a responsible power. Attaining such a characterization in the world community might prove especially valuable in light of the present period of American unilateralism. Like other developing nations such as Pakistan and India, China could find that the relatively low cost of engaging as part of a multi-national force is outweighed by respect gained among fellow nations. Moreover, peacekeeping activities present an opportunity for the PLA to forge greater trust and understanding between the Chinese and foreign military establishments, as well as potentially bringing Chinese and foreign non-governmental relief organizations together with the central government on specific issues.41

Finally, one can envision a future in which Chinese attitudes towards peacekeeping tend towards those exhibited by the United States as a great power. As China rises, Beijing may increasingly find itself wary of material involvement in external affairs in which it does not command exclusive control. Such an outcome would of course be generally negative for peacekeeping efforts, with the two largest economies and militaries in the world refusing much more than financial aid in this respect. Unfortunately, skepticism regarding multilateral security initiatives may be a corollary of growing individual state power.

Regardless of Beijing's ultimate views on peacekeeping, China's clout in the decision-making process surrounding future interventions and missions will only increase. Along with this power will come expectations from the world community that China exercise its influence and capabilities in a responsible, constructive manner, preferably different from the interests which have too often characterized UN peacekeeping policy during the past 60 years. On this, the world community is likely to be disappointed. Even as China has engaged more closely with the outside world since 1997 through the mechanism of peacekeeping, it has continued to promote its own interests and principles even above material requirements for peace. However, such behavior is nothing new to the exercise of collective security. The ultimate significance of China's role in the process will be to bring to bear additional resources, new perspectives and, with some luck, a firm commitment to safeguarding peace and stability in an ever-volatile world.

To conclude, the People's Republic of China has undertaken a concerted effort to expand its involvement in UN peacekeeping operations over the past ten years as made evident by its recent behavior. Though little has changed in official PRC doctrine since the 1980s, the willingness of Beijing to take action and the attendant benefits of doing so have significantly changed the decision-making calculus. For China, these benefits come in the form of reputational gains, stability which complements Chinese economic growth, fulfilled diplomatic objectives and enhanced military experience for the PLA. Chinese actions have already produced tangible results in countries such as Liberia, the Congo and the Sudan, while perceived failure of China to act constructively now provokes worldwide comment and criticism. Although the ultimate results of pursuing greater involvement in peacekeeping operations may yet be unclear, even to the Chinese themselves, none should doubt that China can and will remain a significant player in the world's most visible collective security arrangement.",73.44,56.53,67.06,25.07,24949
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,"""In God we trust?""
The Battle between Evolution and Intelligent Design","Where has God, or spirituality, gone in the United States? Religion is an important part of the world. It influences people in the way they talk, act, and engage with others. To know the world, one must know religion. However, today we are taking spirituality out of our courts, our public buildings, and eliminating any talk of religion from our schools. Education has gone through a transforming process of secularization, separating public schools from any religious ideas. In the U.S., prayers and readings of religious texts have been taken out of the schools, and today the argument continues over evolution and intelligent design. This process of secularization seen throughout the history of the U.S. educational system has been influenced and motivated by the legal process, grassroots organizers (specifically parents), and the media.

Religion has played a significant role in the U.S. education system. Until the late 19th century, creationism was taught in nearly all schools through a literal interpretation of the Bible. With the acceptance of the theory of evolution in the 1860's along with developments in other sciences public schools began to teach science that was reconciled with Christianity by most people (Creation and Evolution). After World War I, the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy brought strong opposition to the theory of evolution, which led to legislation that prohibited the teaching of this subject. In 1925, John T. Scopes, a Tennessee teacher that taught evolution in defiance, and the American Civil Liberties Union brought a case against this legislation, which became known as the Scopes Monkey Trial. Scopes was convicted, but the publicity from the media encouraged supporters of evolution to take a stand. Scopes was convicted for his lessons, but this was quickly overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court; however, the legislation was not declared unconstitutional by the court. The court stated:

We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927) (Creation and Evolution).

The teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee because the interpretation of the First Amendment was that Congress could not establish a particular religion as the State religion (Creation and Evolution). Since the legislation did not establish one religion as the State religion it was not unconstitutional.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that Congress should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise of religion (First Amendment). The interpretation of the First Amendment by the legal system, schools, and the public has been extremely important in the impact that religion and specific science curriculum has had on the U.S. education system. The amendment's interpretation has changed since the Scopes Monkey Trial and this has had a significant impact on legislation and the separation of church and state.

Lemon v. Kurtzman was a vital case in U.S. history that helped to define the First Amendment and religion's role in education. In 1968, Pennsylvania's Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Education Act allowed the state Superintendent of Public Instruction to reimburse nonpublic schools (most of which were Catholic) for teachers' salaries, textbooks and instructional materials (Edwards - U.S. Supreme Court). Therefore, Pennsylvania provided continuing financial aid directly to the church-related schools. In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled this act to be in violation of the Establishment clause in the First Amendment with an 8-1 decision. The Court's decision in this case established the Lemon test, which defines the requirements for legislation concerning religion. It consists of three rules:

1. The government's action must have a secular legislative purpose; 2. The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; 3. The government's action must not result in an ""excessive government entanglement"" with religion (Lemon - Wikipedia).
If any of these 3 rules is violated, the government's action is deemed unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (Lemon - Wikipedia). Lemon v. Kurtzman helped to define the First Amendment and the role it would play in the battle between religion and education in the future.

Another important case, Abington Township School District v. Schempp, occurred in 1963 and is vilified as one that ‘kicked God and prayer out of the schools (Corbett 1). During this time, Pennsylvania had statutes that called for the daily reading of a chapter from the Bible and recitation of the Lord's Prayer in that state's tax-funded schools (2). Edward Schempp was a parent in the Abington Township School District and a Unitarian that disagreed with the promotion of Christianity at state expense. During this time, five states had statutes compelling schools to perform Bible readings, while twenty-five states had laws allowing optional Bible reading. Schempp's complaint alleged the state-sponsored Bible reading and accompanying recitation of the Lord's Prayer were unconstitutional establishments of religion which prohibited the free exercise thereof for both him and his children (2). On the other hand, the defense contended that such reading was an invaluable aid in the development of the minds and morals of school children that the State had a constitutional right to employ (2). The defense also argued that the Bible was not an inherently religious work. However, the Court did not believe this implicit claim. The US District Court of Pennsylvania said, The Bible is essentially a religious work…The daily reading of the Bible…can hardly do less than inculcate…various religious doctrines in childish minds (3). Furthermore, the bench was equally unconvinced of any true freedom enjoyed by the children to interpret the Bible readings as they saw fit (3). The Supreme Court handed down a controversial 8-1 decision in favor of Schempp declaring school sponsored Bible reading and prayer in public schools to be unconstitutional (1).

The media and the public were divided in their reaction to the Court's decision. Newspapers were found to be either critical or supportive. The Washington Evening Star declared that God and religion have all but been driven from the public schools. What remains? Will the baccalaureate service and Christmas carols be the next to go? (6). In contrast, the New York Times was more supportive of the Court's decision. The view of Christian denominations was also diverse. Figures such as Reverend Dr. Billy Graham were in outright disagreement, while others were less critical. Congress responded immediately by proposing bills to overturn the decision by amending the Constitution. By April 1964, over one hundred-fifty such amendments had been proposed (6). Colbert explains that this strong reaction from Congress, school districts, parents, and concerned religious groups was brought on by an erroneous belief that Abington v. Schempp prohibited such religious activity, when in reality it merely restrained the government from interfering either to promote or prohibit such activity (7). The reaction of Congress shows the impact that its constituents – parents, religious groups, schools – have on their actions.

Louisiana's Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction Act brought about another essential case that would help to define the First Amendment and religions role in schools. The Creationism Act forbids the teaching of the theory of evolution in public elementary and secondary schools unless accompanied by instruction in the theory of creation science. The Act does not require the teaching of either theory unless the other is taught (Edwards - Wikipedia). The act was made into law through aggressive lobbying by Creationists. The case, known as Edwards v. Aguillard, was decided by the Supreme Court in 1987. The Court ruled with a 7-2 decision, using the Lemon test, that the Louisiana act was unconstitutional and in violation of the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment. The majority of the Court argued the following:

The Act does not further its stated secular purpose of ""protecting academic freedom."" It does not enhance the freedom of teachers to teach what they choose, and fails to further the goal of ""teaching all of the evidence."" Forbidding the teaching of evolution when creation science is not also taught undermines the provision of a comprehensive scientific education… Instead, this Act has the distinctly different purpose of discrediting evolution by counterbalancing its teaching at every turn with the teaching of creationism. The Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind (Edwards – US Supreme Court).

The ruling effectively removed creationism from public schools. Although the ruling only impacted state schools and not others, it had a great effect on the creationist movement. Within two years of the decision a Creationist textbook was written, Of Pandas and People, which attacked evolutionary biology. In the 1990s the Creationism movement changed to be known as the Intelligent Design movement, which would lead to further community action and further legal action involving U.S. education (Edwards - Wikipedia).

In more recent years, the controversy between religion and education in the U.S. has been over the factual teaching of the theory of evolution. The argument has been over the content that students are exposed to and the lack of other teachings about the beginning of life. Different school districts, parents, and teachers have supported the teaching of intelligent design along with the curriculum on evolution. The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection (Discovery Institute). The Dover Area School District in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania required students in biology classes to be made aware of intelligent design as an alternative to the theory of evolution. Questions about the statement and questions related to intelligent design could not be addressed in the classroom and were encouraged to be discussed at home. A federal lawsuit was filed against the Dover School District on behalf of 8 families by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State…The two groups allege intelligent design is merely a secular variation of creationism, the biblical-based view that regards God as the creator of life (Kuehnel 2). Their argument claims that the district's action violated the constitutional separation of church and state.

The questions that the Court addressed are the following: Is the school district simply making kids aware of an 'alternative scientific view,' as the school board contends? Or do the four paragraphs undermine science education and unconstitutionally advance religion? (Haynes). The court ruled that a teaching, or even statement, about intelligent design was unconstitutional under the first amendment. Judge Jones went even further in his ruling, finding that intelligent design was not science: It is our view that a reasonable, objective observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, and our narrative, reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science (Evolution and Creation). The Discovery Institute, the leading proponent of the idea of intelligent design, probably wishes this trial had never happened. Discovery wants schools to raise questions about evolutionary theory, but not mandate (at least not yet) that intelligent design be mentioned as a scientific alternative. A loss in court that labels intelligent design religious can result in devastating effects to the movement for intelligent design (Haynes).

Social change within the Dover Area School District occurred because of the organizing efforts of parents and the legal action that they pursued. Eight parents came together to challenge the school district and through their passion and the legal process that they pursued they were able to create change for their children. This change not only impacted their school district and their children, but every school district across the United States.

A similar case occurred in 2002 in Georgia between the Cobb County Board of Education and a group of parents involving the teaching of evolution. Two thousand parents in the school district complained and organized against the factual representation of evolution taught to their children. In response, the school board placed stickers addressing evolution in all of the science books. The sticker said the following, This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered (Judge). In response to the sticker, 6 parents, along with the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the Cobb County Board of Education. In January 2005, Judge Clarence Cooper ruled that the stickers were unconstitutional and that they be removed from all science textbooks. An agreement was reached when the school district agreed not to attempt to place similar stickers in textbooks again and when the plaintiffs agreed to end all legal action against the school district (Agreement).

The court cases over the past few years have resulted in several consequences for school districts. School districts have had to pay the costs of defending their stance in legal action. For example, the Cobb County School District had to pay $166,659 for a portion of the plaintiff's legal fees on top of their own legal fees (Agreement). These legal actions divert funds that the district could be using for the education of their students. Furthermore, tax-payers and voters may see this as irresponsible and a burden on their tax money.

One problem that parents and school districts have with the teaching of evolution is the way it is defined. According to the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian group active in the evolution debate (but not supportive of the teaching of intelligent design), evolution in science textbooks has six principal meanings:

1. Change over time; history of nature; any sequence of events in nature. 2. Changes in the frequencies of alleles in the gene pool of a population. 3. Limited common descent: the idea that particular groups of organisms have descended from a common ancestor. 4. The mechanisms responsible for the change required to produce limited descent with modification, chiefly natural selection acting on random variations or mutations. 5. Universal common descent: the idea that all organisms have descended from a single common ancestor. 6. Blind watchmaker thesis: the idea that all organisms have descended from common ancestors solely through an unguided, unintelligent, purposeless, material processes such as natural selection acting on random variations or mutations; that the mechanisms of natural selection, random variation and mutation, and perhaps other similarly naturalistic mechanisms, are completely sufficient to account for the appearance of design in living organisms (Meyer 136).
Controversy develops when scientists, teachers, and students try to evaluate evolution in the 5th or 6th sense of the term. At present, many public policy (and other) statements about how to teach evolution lapse uncritically into describing evolution (that is, universal common descent) as a fact (Meyer 140). This causes problems for students because they are not given the information in a way to think critically about evolution and the origin of life. Furthermore, this causes problems for parents because this kind of teaching influences the beliefs and values that they want for their children.

The other problem with defining evolution is by saying it is just a theory. Defining evolution with these words insinuates that evolution does not have widespread acceptance amongst scientists, promoting the teaching of alternative pseudosciences such as intelligent design, and completely ignoring evolution in biology classes (Creation and Evolution). In general, these controversies with the teaching of evolution have resulted in Federal and state court actions, such as those in the Dover Area School District and in Cobb County, which are usually brought about by parents opposed to any religious teaching in schools. There needs to be a balance in the teaching of evolution that does not undermine or discredit one's religious beliefs, but that also clearly represents the subject of evolution. The Discovery Institute and Phillip E. Johnson, support the policy of Teach the Controversy, which entails presenting to students evidence for and against evolution, and then encouraging students to evaluate that evidence themselves.

The grassroots efforts for intelligent design have continued to strive to impact the teaching of evolution and the science curriculum in the education system. Many proponents of intelligent design desire to greatly undermine or eliminate the teaching of evolution in public schools. However, opponents argue that intelligent design and teaching of the supernatural is not scientific and has no place in schools. Philip E. Johnson, a leader in the intelligent design movement, says, Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story...When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind...known as 'culture war' (Intelligent Design). This culture war has encouraged many to be involved and to organize on both sides of the battle. Many Christians, religious believers, and other intelligent design supporters have started organizations (such as the Discovery Institute), written books and documents, lobbied to their politicians, and held conferences on the subject. These efforts have caused school districts and politicians to take action, but they have not created the desired results.

Despite grassroots efforts by supporters of intelligent design, the organizing efforts by parents against intelligent design and the impact of the legal system have led to significant social change in U.S. education. From Abington Township School District v. Schempp to the Dover Area School District case, parents have been active in their fight for change and they have been winning the fight. Though there has been opposition against them, they have found success because of their use of the legal system. Through their efforts they have forced the Court to clearly define the First Amendment and they have caused sweeping change that is impacting the entire United States. Their success shows that grassroots activists working through the legal system can impact the political process to bring about social change.

Do I agree with the direction our education has been heading in regards to evolution? No, because I do not think that evolution is clearly defined for students to make their own opinions about the origin of life. There needs to be a strict, unbiased curriculum that does not influence or persuade the minds of students. My Uncle Bud grew up in a Christian household, but he was negatively impacted by his teacher in school. His teacher held a piece of chalk in the air and said, If there is a God, he won't let this chalk break. Upon dropping it, the chalk broke on the ground. The teacher's own beliefs and ideas turned my uncle against religion and caused him to become an atheist. I believe that the way evolution is defined and portrayed to students can also impact the way they view spirituality and the existence of god(s). This is not only a Christian argument, which it is often made out to be (because they are the strongest protesting voices). The way this subject is taught affects Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Baha'ism, and all religions. I think it would be beneficial to students to know the flaws and specific evidence for evolution (especially the 5th and 6th definitions), but also to know that there are alternatives to evolution and the origin of life.

My fear is that we are pushing God and spirituality out of every part of our lives. Even here at the University of Michigan religion has been replaced. It is no longer offered as a major that one can pursue. People argue that religion is private (The Case Against School Prayer). This has become true in our country. To many, religion has become a private matter that is not discussed and that is not a part of our everyday lives. However, I don't think religion is meant to be private. We learn about other subjects, like evolution, by discussing it with each other and by wrestling with questions that we don't understand. I think all people ask themselves, What's my purpose? Was I created? Is there more to life on this Earth? I believe that this is the most important question that we need to ask ourselves, Is there a God, or higher power? I believe that we cannot answer this question, or the other ones alone, and I don't think that we were meant to answer them alone. Unfortunately, I think the current education system answers this question for students without allowing them to think critically about other possibilities. Does this mean I think evolution should not be taught? No. However, I do think that evolution and any of its flaws need to be clearly defined for students, which will allow them to develop their own foundation on the origin of life. For this to happen people, especially parents and students, will need to organize and work through the courts and the media to impact the political process and bring about social change.",22.18,48.47,33.33,25.5,22333
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Ethics in International Development,"Whether it's Bono organizing a concert for AIDS relief or Angelina Jolie speaking about the plight of millions of the world's children, nothing has become more popular than promoting international aid to Africa. Celebrities, politicians and the world's rich all pontificate on the need to save the rest of the world by sending a massive influx of aid relief that will finally raise developing nations out of extreme poverty. But what is popular is not always right.

Does the West really know where to direct aid? Who should be put in charge of the valuable resources sent to help the poor? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that the people who really need aid will receive it? How does one even know if foreign aid guarantees the outcomes it is sent to ensure? As long as aid demands continue to be made in sound bytes ready for the national media and MTV these questions will never be addressed. If the advocates of increasing foreign aid truly care about improving the conditions of the world's poor, and not just about making themselves feel better, the answers to these questions must to be investigated before action is taken.

Two authors have attempted to address some of these questions in their books on aid to the developing world. While they arrive at vastly different conclusions they both attempt to address the infinite questions surrounding the effectiveness of foreign aid. Jeffrey Sachs in his book titled The End of Poverty joined the popular crowd in his quest to ramp up foreign aid spending. While Dr. Sachs attempts to use economic data to support his increased calls for foreign aid funding, his book fails to clearly establish the effectiveness of foreign aid. However, this does not mean his book is without purpose. If popular movements use social pressure to achieve positive goals then drastic changes can occur. Dr. Sachs, Bono and the myriad of other celebrities can wake the general public from a coma of isolation and a refusal to acknowledge the horrors that occur daily in the rest of the world. By helping people in the West understand the conditions faced by individuals in developing nations, Dr. Sachs increased support for foreign aid spending.

In The White Man's Burden Dr. William Easterly demands that Western nations own up to their past actions in the developing world and begin to take account for the impact of foreign aid. Dr. Easterly forces the aid community to examine the effects of foreign aid that are often ignored. He argues that foreign aid is often ineffective and can actually have a negative impact on countries it is designed to help. Dr. Easterly states that foreign aid needs the same type of policy recommendations that are often directed at developing countries: a diversification of investments, independent monitoring of outcomes and a requirement that aid organizations take responsibility for the outcomes of their actions (Easterly, 370). While these recommendations are unpopular to many, they represent one way to improve the dismal success rate of foreign aid intervention.

Many individuals see these two authors' recommendations as incompatible. One cannot possibly support both Dr. Sachs and Dr. Easterly. However, it is possible to support both if one considers each author to have a different purpose. Dr. Sachs wants more money to be spent on aid and Dr. Easterly wants the money to be spent more effectively. It is possible to support both if you realize that Dr. Sachs has a comparative advantage in raising money and Dr. Easterly understands how to distribute it more effectively. Both of their recommendations can be accepted if they are put towards different components of the same problem: how to improve the effectiveness of foreign aid.

Foreign aid is a controversial issue in domestic politics, regardless of the industrialized country where it is being discussed. A common objection to supporting increases in foreign aid is the belief that developed nations were able to grow by themselves in the past. If the West was able to do it why do these other countries need help? Why can't they do it themselves? Dr. Sachs argues that these nations are stuck in a poverty trap and need aid to move them up the development ladder (Sachs, 19). However, this response does not answer the original question; who helped Europe move out of the poverty trap of the dark ages? The answer is no one and this is why Dr. Sachs answer is unsatisfying.

It is possible that the reason the West was able to pull itself out of the poverty trap was because no one was there to help them. Few people acknowledge that the methods used during the development of the West are no longer acceptable options exactly because they were already used to propel the West to economic success. Let's pretend that an imaginary continent experienced an industrial revolution in 1400's and was an economic superpower by the time Europe got around to the Renaissance. How would the presence of a more developed nation have impacted Europe's development? While all factors cannot be accounted for let's re-examine a few major historical events with this new superpower in mind, ready to help at the first sign of trouble.

Great Britain is often considered to be the leader of the economic transformation that led the development of Europe and eventually the United States. However, would Great Britain have achieved such astonishing success if a West had existed during their development? The answer is probably not because many of their activities would have been prevented. An economically advanced big brother would not have let Great Britain colonize the numerous nations that powered their growth. Therefore, they would not have had access to the vast quantities of raw material that they extracted from their colonies. The widespread colonization that led to the growth of so many European countries would most likely have been impossible if an economically superior nation had existed.

In addition to preventing colonization and mass resource extraction how would a superpower have felt about the French and American revolutions? These two events are often viewed as critical turning points in world history. However, it is unlikely that if our imaginary superpower reacted to revolution the same way the West does know that either of these historical events would have occurred. A superpower would most likely have restored King Louis after the French revolution and would most likely have sided with the British during the American Revolution. Even if the Americans had been allowed to discard British rule would they have been left alone to create their own government? If our imaginary superpower followed current international policy protocol the answer is most likely no.

Even if we imagine a more enlightened superpower that acted more benevolently than the west has been known to in the past the United States would not have developed as quickly as it did. First of all, a massive genocide occurred following the American war for independence. The Native American population was essentially destroyed. While the West has conveniently ignored genocide in the past the pretend superpower may have taken notice and stepped in to prevent the destruction of the native population. Even if they had ignored the genocide, the West loves nothing better than to try and resolve a civil war through peace talks and negotiations. The American civil war would have been interrupted before a decisive winner was decided. A shaky peace agreement might have been reached and the conflict would never have been truly resolved. The stability achieved by a concrete northern victory would never have been occurred. As these examples illustrate if an imaginary superpower had existed to provide aid and expertise to a fledgling Europe it is unlikely that the West would have been able to develop as quickly or as successfully as they were able to. Regardless of why they were first, certain advantages accompanied this position and the circumstances around that development should be recognized when analyzing current development attempts by the rest of the world.

Luckily for the West, they were the first to develop and did not have to account for the influence of a more powerful neighbor. In addition to policy interference, the influx of foreign aid affects economic outcomes and not always in positive ways. Foreign aid is often a majority component of developing nation's budgets. This makes it a resource for developing governments similar to oil or mineral deposits. If one resource dominates economic outcomes in a resource rich country then economic disaster can occur because the leader only monitors the performance of one economic variable. A multitude of research studies have been published on the resource curse described above. The resource curse describes the trend that countries abundant in natural resources tend to have worse economic growth as compared with their resource poor neighbors. While this may seem counterintuitive it has proven true across numerous regions and countries. Because political leaders have a resource to rely on that is independent from the people there is little incentive to create economic policies that will promote growth for the entire economy. As long as the political leader has access to resources no drive exists to improve the economy because all government revenue is derived from the lone resource (Auty, 1999).

The resource curse was first used to describe economies dependent on natural resources but the problems should also develop with dependence on foreign aid that funds a majority of the governments' expenditures. In fact it seems possible that the resource curse caused by reliance on foreign aid may create even worse incentive structures for leaders than dependence on a single natural resource. This is because the quantity of foreign aid is tied to the economic performance of the country. Poorer countries tend to get more aid. Unlike oil revenues, foreign aid will start to decrease if a country begins to improve economically. Therefore, a corrupt leader might have an incentive to ensure that the economy stays stagnant or regresses to ensure that foreign aid flows stay sufficiently high. This distorted incentive structure does not exist for leaders dependent on natural resources.

This reasoning, if validated, could prove to be a strong counterargument to Dr. Sachs concept of the Big Push. Dr. Sachs advocates that poor countries need a huge influx of aid to raise them out of the poverty trap (Sachs, 256). He argues that a complete package of services needs to be introduced and only then will true economic growth occur. However, if this package causes foreign aid to become a majority of the budget the distorted incentives become possibilities. Unless strict measures are implemented to ensure that all aid reaches the intended recipients, aid agencies are providing a resource pool for an advantageous leader to derive a profit from. Also if it becomes clear that foreign agencies are willing to provide all social services any previous incentive for the government to provide these services evaporates.

Instead of the Big Push that Dr. Sachs promotes, Dr. Easterly recommends a diversification of aid projects into many small and specialized projects that have set objectives and that can be held accountable for the success or failure of those objectives. To accomplish this goal increased feedback from aid recipients is crucial. Dr. Easterly points out that feedback in the West is accomplished through democracy. Aid agencies stress the importance of democratic governments in recipient countries but there is no accountability in the governance of foreign aid projects (Easterly, 381). Remote donors often decide which projects are funded and there is no mechanism in place to hold aid organizations accountable for results. Instead of a big push of aid funneled through governments that are not always reliable, funding should be given to small groups capable with specific goals to be completed in a given timeframe.

Opportunities to match donors with local projects of this nature are already under way. One website that tackles the problem of matching small scale local aid requests with international donors is globalgiving.com. The website allows project coordinators to post projects on the website with a funding goal. Potential donors are free to browse the website and can give to an organization of their choice. Project coordinators post progress updates so donors stay informed of the impact of their gift. The website also offers a refund in the form of a voucher to all donors. This proves that the website coordinators have carefully researched each project and are willing to guarantee the legitimacy of the projects. Small opportunities of this nature could help revolutionize the distribution of foreign aid.

Unfortunately, small projects like the one described above can not solve the problems of the extreme poor by themselves. As long as problems exist that require large economies of scale to be successful the role of massive aid organizations can not be overlooked. But what type of projects should large agencies address. Dr. Sachs would argue that every problem of the poor needs to be addressed simultaneously in a massive push. However, as the text above indicates this strategy will not be pursued. Instead aid agencies need to focus on improving basic needs of those living in extreme poor.

Foreign aid specialists from The International Monetary Fund and The World Bank often discuss the need for economic growth above all else. In order to accomplish this prioritized goal they often recommend policies that prevent governments from getting basic resources to their citizens. Before economic growth can occur, developing nations need a workforce that is not listless from malnutrition and sick from a variety of preventable diseases. Improving agricultural yields and healthcare outcomes should be the first priorities of foreign aid.

Support for this recommended focus on agriculture and healthcare can be found by examining former third world countries that have now achieved some degree of economic success. China and India are two countries that began their economic transformation through revolutions in the agricultural sector. China's agricultural revolution began in Xiaogang, China; a rural village comprised of peasant farmers. A few farmers met secretly and decided to cast off the communist system of communal farming and instituted property rights (Easterly, 107). This seemingly simple action, the creation of property rights, allowed the Chinese peasants to feed themselves. Instead of rejecting the peasants insight, communist officials adopted private farming and as a result saw crop yields skyrocket. China went from a poor nation that was unable to keep its people from starving to a nation posting the highest consistent growth rates of the last 30 years. While many other factors contributed to the massive growth spurt, it all began in the agricultural sector. When people can feed themselves, new opportunities arise.

India's Green Revolution is another example of how agricultural reform allows future economic growth to occur. In the 1970's, thanks to the work of plant breeders, several high yield versions of familiar crops were introduced in agricultural regions of India. The crops were a success and for the first time in history, India no longer had to worry about mass starvation (Sachs, 177). Just as in China, the agricultural revolution did not guarantee economic growth. Instead it made economic growth a possibility. Regardless of which economic policies are adopted, if a significant portion of a population is suffering from malnutrition, little economic growth can occur because worker productivity will remain low. Both of these countries illustrate the benefits that can accrue once mass starvation is eliminated through agricultural reforms.

Even with these two shining examples the IMF, World Bank, and donor nations often refuse to allow countries to offer fertilizer subsidies or introduce high yield seed at a reduced cost. These countries insist that developing nations follow free market practices even if it means that farmers will be denied access to desperately needed fertilizer. Malawi is a perfect example of the positive benefits that can occur when agriculture is made a priority. In 2005 almost 5 million of Malawi's 13 million citizens received emergency food aid to prevent starvation. In 2006 Malawi's President refused to give in to donor demands and insisted on heavily subsidizing fertilizer. As a result, this former food aid importer is now the largest exporter of food in sub-Saharan Africa. For the first time Malawi is able to not only feed itself, but actually export goods for a profit (NYT, 12-2-07). While this is no guarantee that further economic growth will occur in Malawi, it does guarantee that true growth is now at least a possibility. Previously, with almost half of its population starving, growth was unlikely. With lower rates of malnutrition, disease rates should also be expected to decrease because individuals have the caloric resources to battle pathogens. If crop yields remain high, it is possible that people could begin to specialize with fewer people having to farm for survival. This specialization could spur economic growth. While these predictions are only possibilities, something as simple as fertilizer subsidies created possibilities for economic growth where none had existed before.

Once a population moves away from the brink of mass starvation, the next priority should be improving basic healthcare. When diseases consistently ravage populations it is difficult, if not impossible, for economic growth to occur. Africa represents a complex healthcare challenge because of the myriad of diseases afflicting people. From preventable conditions like malaria to the worst virus to plague man in centuries, AIDS, Africa must combat all of these conditions even though each disease requires its own treatment approach to be effective.

Controlling disease is a necessary condition for economic growth. An excellent example of this fact can be found by tracing European health and economic development. The dark ages are considered a time of economic stagnation accompanied by terrible disease. From the Black Plague to Smallpox, Europe had its share of horrendous diseases. As these diseases ravaged the population little economic growth could occur because much of the workforce was incapacitated due to a plethora of disease. Additionally, high birth rates due to high rates of child mortality resulted in little investment per child. This resulted in a burgeoning population, sick from disease, with a low rate of investment in human capital. Not exactly an excellent formula for economic growth, and yet people continue to be surprised that African countries have such low growth rates, even though they face the conditions described above.

Europe was not able to take off economically until these diseases were addressed. People slowly began to understand how the plague was transmitted and outbreaks decreased. Edward Jenner found a vaccine for smallpox that would save billions of lives throughout history. Basic medicine began to improve as the importance of sanitation was realized. All of these advances led to a healthier population which made it possible for economic growth to occur.

Thanks to World Health Organization efforts Africa no longer has to face smallpox, however, an equally preventable disease has not received the same attention. Malaria remains one of the largest killers of children under five. Once infected, malaria can be lethal. However, simple and inexpensive measures such as a bed net used while sleeping can be extremely effective. Something as simple as a bed net should be the ideal product for aid organizations to distribute. Very little training is required for proper use and recipients do not need follow up appointments with medical personal after they have received the net. The key is educating people to ensure that they understand the importance of using the nets.

Even though the bed net seems like the ideal item for aid organizations to distribute, there are still numerous problems. Donated nets often do not find their way to the people who need them most. Also usage rates among people who received nets for free is quite low. According to Dr. Easterly these problems exist because planners remote from recipients are determining where the nets go and who receives them. Instead, he advocates that recipients who want nets be required to pay a small fee for them. Additionally, local health workers responsible for selling the nets would receive a small portion of the sale to keep for themselves (Easterly, 13). This use of the market makes sure nets go to the people who actually value them. Allowing healthcare workers to keep a small percentage of each sale also provides an incentive for workers to keep nets in stock at locations where they are in demand. A market system that utilizes the knowledge and preferences unique to each community will be far more effective than a system where donors have the power to choose who receives life saving products.

Installing a market based system to fight other preventable diseases is an exciting possibility. If a similar setup could be established to distribute vaccines for childhood illnesses or oral rehydration therapy for common ailments like diarrhea significant advances could be made against these preventable diseases. While it is impossible to guarantee that a market based solution will work, it is possible to agree that the current solution is failing. In a world where treatments are available for as little as 12 cents per dose it is unacceptable that the treatments are not reaching those who need them. When cost is not a prohibitive factor something must be wrong with the distribution of the product in preventing its delivery. That problem is created by donors acting as planners trying to organize who gets what and when. Unfortunately, coordinating the delivery of medicine across a continent without an understanding of local preferences is to complex a task for even the best intentioned planners.

The challenges to treating disease are infinitely compounded when treatment price skyrockets from a few cents per dose to thousands of dollars per patient. This is the case with treatment efforts for HIV/AIDS. The world has not seen a disease as lethal as AIDS since smallpox. AIDS has decimated a generation of adult Africans leaving behind a generation of orphans to be cared for by their aging grandparents. The disease has paralyzed economic growth by killing much of the adult workforce (Sachs, 201). Economic advances can not be made if the majority of the workforce is too sick to actually work.

The complications from AIDS are compounded by the fact that no effective treatment or prevention yet exists. Until a vaccine or cure is developed AIDS will continue to stunt African growth. What treatment does exist has been prohibitively expensive and complicated to administer. Antiretroviral therapy (ARV's) used to cost thousands of dollars per patient. While donations from drug companies and new production methods have significantly reduced this price the treatment is still too expensive to be available to all individuals affected with the disease. Even if treatment price was somehow dramatically lowered it could still not be mass distributed. This is because while ARV's are often the only shot patients have at life, they cause a variety of complicated side effects. Patients need to be monitored by healthcare workers who are able to adjust dosages to control side effects. Additionally if the medicine is not taken correctly the HIV virus can mutate and develop resistance. It is for these reasons that it has taken so long for donors to make AIDS treatments widely available.

Even with these complications people possibly infected with the disease need to believe that treatments are available. If no treatment is available no motivation exists to get tested. If individuals are not tested they will never know their HIV status and will continue to spread the disease to others. Dr. Easterly disagrees with this point by playing a numbers game, he points out that many more lives could be saved if the money used to buy ARV's was instead directed to mass purchases of cheaper medicines. However, Dr. Easterly fails to account for the lives saved by prevention. Because ARV's became available more people were tested and therefore fewer people should have been infected. Avoiding new infections is a key component in controlling the AIDS epidemic. Oddly enough, in this situation treating AIDS can be thought of as a type of prevention. While this paper could continue on indefinitely discussing possible prevention and treatment measures for a host of infectious diseases that affect the developing world, the main point is that the healthcare situation in these countries needs to be improved for the economy to grow. As long as a majority of the population continues to be sick growth will remain elusive.

Many people will ask what about education and infrastructure and electricity, don't these things deserve some portion of foreign aid funds. The answer is that in an ideal world of course they deserve to be funded. However, in the imperfect world that exists, funding is limited. Choices have to be made between projects. The reasoning above explains one argument for why agriculture and healthcare should be given priority. However, this is not the logic that has to be followed. It is the Poor's voices who should be consulted when making difficult choices between aid projects. Donors need only ask the poor which project they value most. While deciding between a new school or a healthcare clinic is not a choice anyone wants to make, the people affected by the choice most should have the final say. Planners, like Dr. Sachs, seem incapable of recognizing the fact that these types of decisions must be made. Maybe this is because planners have never had to make a decision of this magnitude that affected their very survival. People in developing nations however, are forced to make these types of decisions daily. Since they have the most experience with decisions of this magnitude and they are the ones affected by the decision it seems only logical that donors follow the Poor's preferences. Unfortunately, foreign aid rarely follows the dictates of logic.",20.71,29.68,19.5,8.46,26625
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,What Is A Jew?,"There are few religions or cultures as nebulous as Judaism. No offspring of one Christian and one nonreligious parent ever says, I’m half-Christian. Yet, it is not uncommon to hear half-Jews say so. Nor do people who follow a completely different religion ever say that they have Christian heritage. Some argue that Judaism is entirely based on faith and values, and has nothing to do with blood lineage, while others claim they are Jewish due to their heritage, even though they ascribe to other beliefs. Still others assert their Jewishness despite a lack of religious or parental ties, in decisions based solely on genetics tracing back thousands of years. So, truly, who are the Jews? Are they a race? Even if they consider themselves, and are considered by others, to be a race, does genetics agree?

In his recent book, Abraham’s Children: Race, Identity, and the DNA of the Chosen People, Jon Entine tackles these questions and more, though few are answered. Few can be answered, as they are all linked and dependent upon one another. He delves even further into the issues of Jewish race and identity, deepening his exploration to ask controversial questions such as: are the Jews more intelligent than others? If so, can this hyperintelligence be linked to certain diseases prevalent among Jews? Though Entine’s book promises to answer compelling questions about Jewish identity, genes, and intelligence, it leaves the reader unfulfilled. Entine, however, cannot be faulted for this. The worlds of genetics, and of religion, are both inordinately large and changing, and though Entine may not address all topics in great depth or detail, his work provides a valuable overview of the current research and discussion about Jewish identity and the questions that accompany it.

Entine simply entitles the first section Identity, and here he lays the groundwork for the rest of the book. His own quest to reveal the truth behind Jews as a race and genetic community began when several members of his family developed breast cancer, many of the cases fatal. In this section, he addresses the broad questions behind DNA and identity and repeals the anthropological assertion that there is no race. He calls anthropological efforts to underplay DNA understandable, but misleading as DNA ensures that we differ not only as individuals, but as groups. 1 Speaking further of DNA, he says that it confirms our common humanity and yet challenges deeply held beliefs of equality. 2 Though he discusses other populations of Jews throughout the book, his main focus is on Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors are from Central and Eastern Europe and who make up 90 percent of the six million Jews living in the United States today.3Though, before the Inquisition, Sephardic Jews were considered the intelligent Jewish population, compared to their downtrodden Ashkenazim brethren, this tolerance actually kept them from becoming good research subjects now. The welcoming attitudes of their new countries allowed for too much genetic mixing; as it is, Dutch Jews are the most genetically mixed of any Jewish group in Europe.4 It is Ashkenazim, therefore, that are the preferred subject of research and of Entine’s writing.

Ashkenazi Jews and the diseases by which they are plagued has long been a favorite subject of scientific study. But, Jews are not the only race with their own associated diseases; cystic fibrosis is common among Northern Europeans, though rare among blacks and Asians. Blacks and some Mediterranean people are more susceptible to sickle cell anemia. One gene mutation accounts for Japanese peoples’ sensitivity to alcohol, while another single mutation present in one fifth of Semites helps them break it down.5 Entine asks, therefore, why Jews?

Due to their restrictive practices, the Jews have kept themselves rather untouched genetically, making them a dream come true for DNA researchers.6 Entine exclaims that, Only Jews have a set of closely linked genetic markers found in ethnic communities in all corners of the globe… an almost incomprehensible genetic confirmation of religious continuity and solidarity. 7 Jews do not have more defective DNA nor more hereditary diseases than other populations, but living and marrying within the confines of the ghettoes for centuries have produced a relatively homogenous population in which tiny genetic alterations, or mutations, that cause disease are easy to find. 8 Throughout history, Jewish survival has been based on fidelity to the religion and the spouse, or in genetic terms, consanguinity and endogamy.9Jews did not begin to marry outside their communities until the early 19th century, but even these outside marriages did not harm the pristine Jewish gene pool.10 These outside marriages have, in fact, had the opposite effect. Those members of the Jewish community who married non-Jews most often did not raise their children as Jews, effectively removing themselves from the Jewish gene pool.11 This explains how Jews, who wandered without a homeland for 2,000 years, could remain so cohesive a genetic group. At the end of this section, Entine provides a reassuring disclaimer about DNA, almost as if justifying his motives behind writing the book. He says, Our identity is based on oral tradition, law, culture, custom and not on physical attributes, including DNA. But, genetics can tell us a great deal about origins and common destiny. 12

In the second part of the book, entitled History, Entine gives a thorough history of the Jewish people, including the wandering tribes and subsequent Jewish pockets around the globe, as well as a discussion of the Ashkenazi Jews. This section of the book, though the least thought provoking, is well-researched and factually very solid. Entine carefully recounts Jewish biblical and secular history until the present. He even includes some interesting genetic research demonstrating that though throughout history Jewish men often paired with local women, less than 0.5 percent of each succeeding generation of Ashkenazi women had children with non-Jewish Europeans, substantiating the Jewish matrilineal tradition.13 This knowledge also reaffirms the solidity of the Jewish gene pool. This historical briefing, however, is only background for the true heart of the book, which is the third section. This final section, which is the most controversial and the most scientific, is aptly called Race.

In Race, Entine continues to elaborate on the history of Jews, though now with a purpose: to try and explain why Jews account for a remarkably high percentage of doctors, lawyers, university students, and Nobel Prize winners, while only making up .25% of the world’s population.14The first element that Entine addresses is cultural heritage, claiming that education is in the Jewish blood. He explains that Jews have always shared a broad commitment to education, because of Judaism’s requirement that its holy texts be read. Unlike the low literacy rate in most rural Christian communities, Jews, by faith, were forced to be able to read every day.15 According to one scholar, this meant that being a Jew required being smart. 16 One of the smartest and most famous Jews, Albert Einstein, advanced a different, yet compatible, theory, saying that It may be thanks to anti-Semitism that we are able to preserve our existence as a race. 17 Entine, like many other scholars, agrees. They argue that continual discrimination against the Jews actually benefited them in terms of intelligence. One of the first proponents of this idea was Joseph Jacobs, a British anthropologist. In 1885, he published a paper entitled The Comparative Distribution of Jewish Ability, in which he compared the ghettoes to genetic jungles, where only the fittest survived.18 Though many weak and poor Jews did perish in the harsh environment of the ghetto, positive selection occurred at this time, as well. The rich families of merchants and rabbis, considered to be the best and the brightest, married each other earlier and had more children, whereas poor families had fewer children and were also less likely to survive.19 This form of positive selection encouraged breeding only by the most intelligent members of the community, and it seemed to work. By the beginning of the 20th century, Jews accounted for 50 percent of doctors in Berlin and 60 percent in Vienna, while only accounting for one percent of the population.20

Not all of history has been so positive, however, and it is understandable why society often shies away from the concepts of race and racial differences. After the Holocaust, the notion of biological races, with the implied ranking of human capacities, came under assault. 21 Universalism, embodied by the newly founded United Nations, became the new ideology of choice, with the hope that ethnic and racial problems would yield to egalitarianism.22 Along with race, genetics came under attack. A group of prominent social scientists created a manifesto called The Statement of Race, which distanced biology from mental and intellectual differences and declared that genes played little role in shaping cultures.23

This new commitment to universalism and the minimization of genetic and racial differences (the nurture side of the nature v. nurture debate) was advanced again in the early 1970s by Harvard zoologist Richard Lewontin. Through studies of genetic markers across populations, he concluded that 85 percent of all human variation is randomly found between individuals with a nation or tribe, setting racial differences at a little more than 10 percent.24 This study became a useful tool for the nurture side and was used to attack any scientific attempts to study racial differences. This eventually led to the downfall of a very promising project known as the Human Genome Diversity Project.25 Despite its attempts to be wholly ethical, a small faction of objectors shut the project down.26 Entine’s disappointment in this fact is palpable throughout the section; it is clear that he truly supported the vision of this project. Recently, however, prominent Stanford University geneticist Neil Risch has questioned the 85 percent figure, claiming that this analysis is based on commonly occurring versions of genes, and rare versions of genes, when measured, may show a greater tendency to be specific to different populations. 27Like Entine, he emphasizes that every race has its own set of diseases and clinical priorities. He believes that, We need to value our diversity rather than fear it. Ignoring our differences, even if with the best of intentions, will ultimately lead to the disservice of those who are in the minority. 28

Not everyone agrees with Risch and Entine, however, as is reflected by the remarks of the scientists who headed the human genome project. In 2000, the human genome map was unveiled, which, surprisingly, dealt another blow to the concept of race. Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute, declared that Americans, regardless of ethnic group are 99.9 percent genetically identical. 29 J. Craig Venter, another chief scientist on the project, added that race has no genetic or scientific basis. 30 These have been the mainstays of the nurture argument, and anthropological and sociological communities across the country have embraced them. Entine does a good job of putting this percentage into perspective, explaining that these numbers alone can paint a misleading picture.

Though all humans are 99.9 percent identical, which seems like a great deal to any layman, it is important to note that bone marrow extracted from Neanderthal skeletons show that they were 99.5 percent identical to modern day humans. Mice, dogs, cattle, and elephants share close to 90 percent of human DNA, while daffodils, members of an entirely different natural kingdom, share 35 percent.31 When put into context, this information implies a very different conclusion. Given that each human has six billion base pairs of DNA per cell, even 1/1000 of six billion base pairs is still six million different base pairs per cell, and therefore, though each person differs from another in a very tiny proportion of their DNA, they differ by a large number of DNA bases.32Entine also points out that this information might even be inaccurate, as well as misleading. In a new study that examined blocks of gene sequences, instead of mere genes, researchers estimated that percentage of differences can vary from 0.1 to 0.3 percent, which is a drastic difference in terms of DNA sequencing. They also concluded that the greatest differences appear in the most complex organs, like the brain.33

The brain, particularly the Jewish brain, and its relation to Jewish health and intelligence, is Entine’s focus for the rest of the book. He begins by discussing health, race, and the Jewish community in broad strokes. His first reference is to a 2002 study led by Risch, which determined that there are five different main races and that each of these races had their own collection of diseases and reactions to drugs. Risch, one of the only scientists willing to discuss and study race and genetics, stated that Ignoring racial and ethnic differences in medical and biomedical research does not make them disappear. 34 He argued that race is a valid area of medical research because it reflects the genetic differences that arose on each continent after the ancestral human population dispersed from its African homeland. 35 An interesting article that Entine includes in his notes but does not cite is a New York Times Magazine piece by a female doctor who declares that she is a racially profiling doctor, because it is not in the patients’ best interests to deny the reality of differences. 36 Though Entine cites Risch and his study as one supporting the existence of racial differences and their importance to global health, which it is, he fails to address Risch’s opposition to the positive selection theory that Entine seems to support. Risch is a strong supporter of genetic drift and not positive selection, but Entine conveniently omits this, as it is not directly related to discussion of the study.

Risch’s study is important, however, because it affirms that there are racial dimensions to health, which was one of Entine’s main goals in writing the book. Though he focuses more later on the diseases of the nervous system, he also discusses breast cancer, and more importantly, the breast cancer gene, in depth. Though breast cancer afflicts the American population at large, striking every one in eight American women, three gene mutations have been discovered that make it even more common among Jewish women.37 Two of the three mutations are BRCA1 and BRCA2, and they are all particularly common among Jewish women. Though one in every 800 women (0.1 percent) in the general population carries the mutation, this number increases to one in forty (2.5 percent) for Jewish women. A gene for colon cancer has also been found in six percent of Ashkenazi Jews, raising a carrier’s chances of getting colon cancer by about 10 percent.38 For carriers of one of the breast cancer mutations, the mutation makes them five to fifteen times more likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer than the rest of the population, raising their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer to 85 percent and of ovarian cancer to 50 percent.39 Why has this gene never been removed among Jewish populations, despite its horrific effects? One theory advanced by University of Chicago geneticists is that BRCA1 may be positively linked to brain development, which is why it has been positively selected and persisted among Jews.40 This idea is similar to the one advanced by Gregory Cochran about Jewish diseases of the nervous system.

But, what other factors could contribute to the wealth of diseases that seem to plague Jews? In general, Jews have historically been perceived by Christians as congenitally enfeebled, and medicine has always played a special role in Jewish culture.41 Due to their cohesive history, it is not surprising that Jews suffer disproportionately from many disorders; this can be attributed to inbreeding, the founder effect, positive selections, and cultural insularity in general.42These diseases, however, are only present in the Ashkenazim populations, as the Sephardic and Oriental Jewish populations intermingled, and interbred, more with other populations, thereby losing many of the disease causing genes.43

In addition to the aforementioned cancers, there are also several nervous system diseases, such as Tay-Sachs and Gouchers, which are abnormally common in Jewish populations. Tay-Sachs, caused by buildups of fatty substances in the brain, was so prevalent in one New York Jewish neighborhood (an estimated one out of sixteen people carried the mutation), that the rabbi began to screen for the disease.44 The screening system was enormously successful and has been implemented across the country, effectively eliminating Tay-Sachs among the Jewish community; it now appears more often in non-Jews than in Jews, a previously inconceivable situation.45 Could the diseases of the nervous system be a result of the founder’s effect and inbreeding, like the cancers? Or, could it be related to positive selection for Jewish intelligence? Do the same reasons that cause certain Jewish diseases also account for raised levels of Jewish intelligence? Before addressing the linkage between these two issues, Entine tackles intelligence.

Are Jews really more intelligent than other populations? And, as Entine’s chapter’s title asks, is it a result of Jewish mothers, or Jewish genes? It has long been considered a part of Jewish cultural heritage that the smartest boys of the shtetl married the daughters of the richest men, but could this account for a type of natural selection among Jews? In 1975, the Harvard University biologist Edward O. Wilson published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, which explained how Darwin’s theory of natural selection could extend to behavior and how it would work in many different species, including people.46 Though sociobiology, also called evolutionary psychology, has often been considered lacking in empirical evidence, it has gained steam and support in the past decade. Entine fails to explain this thoroughly and should have delved deeper into the science surrounding this issue, addressing the controversial question of how much intelligence can even be passed through genes. Apparently, there has been quite a consensus about this issue recently, and other resources note that twin and sibling studies, which can sort genetic from environmental factors, have suggested that more than half of the variation in IQ scores is genetic.47 This paves the way for Entine’s argument that Jewish intelligence is passed down from generation to generation, but how can this be quantifiably measured?

One simple way to compare intelligence among young Americans is through their scores on the SAT. According to the College Board, the non-profit organization that administers the test, Jews scored the second highest among any religious or ethnic group with an average score of 1161. 48 Though Entine tries to claim that the Jews scored the highest, he footnotes that Unitarians scored higher with an average score of 1209. He may have done this because the number of Unitarians (2,354) compared to Jews (27,120) taking the test was so much smaller, but he does not note nor explain this.49 The national average among all groups in the US is 1020. Other stark statistics include the fact that 87 percent of college eligible Jews are enrolled in college, compared to 40 percent of other eligible Americans, and that 23 percent of Ivy League students and 30 percent of Ivy League faculty are Jewish.50 It is important to note, which Entine does not, that only two percent of the US population is Jewish.51 Further demonstrating society’s belief that Jews are smarter, an article that Entine included in the notes but did not cite described a 2002 phenomenon in which universities attempted to recruit Jewish students to raise their academic standing. 52 In one example, the newly hired director of admissions of Vanderbilt University determined that the university was on par with two competitive universities in everything but Jewish enrollment, which he determined was the cause of their lower rankings.53

On a more global, if not older, scale, in 1939, Jews had overcome prejudice to account for one-quarter of university graduates and one-fifth of physicians and scientists, while remaining at just 0.25 percent of the entire population.54And in terms of international recognition, Jews have a 12 times higher success rate than other whites for winning Nobel Prizes, accounting for 36 percent of all American winners. Fifty-four percent of the world’s chess champions have also been Jewish.55 Though Entine omits the fact that these numbers are compiled by considering people with even a single Jewish grandparent to be Jewish, the numbers are still quite impressive.56 Despite these obvious successes, the question of nature v. nurture remains unanswered, and therefore, Entine moves on to discuss the controversial topic of IQ.

In 1904, the French psychologist Alfred Binet developed Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests to evaluate learning disorders in children. This test was modified by the Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman to measure cognitive ability or general intelligence (g).57 Since these tests began to be administered, Ashkenazi Jews have consistently scored higher than the norm. Many studies set, on average, Ashkenazi Jews at a score of 107-117, which is a full standard deviation above the white European average of 110 and makes them the highest tested population in the world.58 In addition, Jews are six times more likely than European whites to be considered a genius (earning a score of 145 or above).59 Approximately 25 percent of white Americans that have this level of IQ are Ashkenazim.60 Entine fails to address the fact that the legitimacy and utility of IQ scores has been questioned in the past, though it is almost unimportant, as recent studies have confirmed that IQ scores can accurately can predict the likelihood of different races of children at finishing high school, staying employed, and avoiding poverty, welfare, or jail.61

Though nature or nurture alone are far too simple of methods to explain human development, they do matter, as well as DNA. Many gene functions are expressed or activated by environmental triggers, and though genes are not the only important factor, they do matter a great deal. Though Entine does not mention it, other sources cite studies of identical twins raised separately after adoption, for which there has been an astounding correlation of .72 for general intelligence as reflected in IQ scores, making even some skeptical social scientists acknowledge that genetics play a major role in intelligence.62 Some scientists believe that the heritability of the brain is as high as 90-95 percent, though Entine wisely acknowledges that the fact that individual intelligence is highly heritable does not necessarily mean that group differences are. 63

There are those, however, who do think that Jewish intelligence is a genetic phenomenon, and Entine focuses on one study in particular. In the summer of 2005, Henry Harpending, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Utah, and Gregory Cochran, a physicist turned genetic theorist, published a paper in the Journal of Biosocial Science called the Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence. 64 Entine does not note the important fact, however, that though the journal is published by Cambridge University, its title had been The Eugenics Review until 1968. This might have given the study a different, though possibly undeserved, undertone.

These men honed the Jewish folk theory that Jews are smart because they are born that way, referring to Jewish historical roles in non-agricultural positions. They named Jewish intelligence as a by-product of Jewish discrimination, separateness, and a commitment to education.65 The American evolutionary biologist and author, Jared Diamond agreed, suggesting that mutated lysosomes might have been positively selected in Jews for the intelligence putatively required to survive recurrent persecution and also to make a living by commerce, because Jews were barred from the agricultural jobs available to the non-Jewish people. 66 Due to restrictions on Jews from owning land and restrictions on Christians from having money-related professions, Jews often survived by usury or collecting taxes on behalf of the nobility.67 One startling record indicates that in 1270, 80 percent of the 228 adult Jewish males in Perpignan, France, made their living through lending.68

Cochran argues that these medieval Jewish professions were those that put a premium on intelligence and therefore primed Jews to be smart through positive selection. Though it is impossible to measure the intelligence required for medieval professions, current studies have shown that intelligence is highly correlated with jobs in banking.69 According to Cochran, throughout history, Jews experienced unusual selective pressures that were likely to have favored increased intelligence. 70 And the most gifted young Jewish scholars were married early to the daughters of the richest Jewish men, allowing these wealthier, and presumably smarter, members of the community to have more children, who would also have a higher likelihood of survival.71 Could this have fostered the breeding of smart Ashkenazi Jews? Necessarily, Entine gives several explanations of why the non-Ashkenazi Jews did not develop the same levels of intelligence. In addition to the higher level of tolerance for other Jews and, therefore, higher levels of intermarriage, there was not the same taboo against money-related professions in the Muslim or Oriental worlds, and therefore Jews were given such dirty jobs as tanners and hangmen, which did not require concentration or a high IQ.72 Entine also attributes Ashkenazi intelligence to selective survival, as European Jews were more persecuted than the others.73

As for the Cochran study, after describing the cultural factors they believed led to increased Jewish intelligence, they then attempted to, on what some have called shaky science, demonstrate linkages between the brain and the nervous system diseases that persist among Jews, known as lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). They speculated that the only way these diseases had persisted among the Jewish population would be that they offered some sort of evolutionary advantage to the carriers. They proposed a comparison to sickle cell anemia, which is a common disease among West Africans. Though this disease is debilitating to those in whom it matures, those who simply carry it are protected against malaria, a deadly disease in the region. For this reason, the mutation has never evolved out of the gene pool. Cochran speculated that the LSDs were similar to this; if one parent was a carrier, the child benefited from greater intelligence, though if two parents were carriers, the child suffered from one of several debilitating diseases.74

All of these sphingolipid-storage diseases, Tay-Sach’s, Gaucher’s, and Niemann-Pick, involve the extra growth and branching of the protuberances that connect nerve cells together, which too much of is extremely damaging to the brain. It is possible, however, that if only one copy of the gene were present, it would yield better linkage between brain cells, and thus, increased intelligence.75 Though Entine might overstate its importance, a 1995 study of rats with Gaucher’s demonstrated that if both parents were carriers, the rat’s brain grew at a wild and debilitating pace, but if only one parent was a carrier, the brain grew at a controlled rate.76 Later studies did show that among the 250 or so Israeli adult Gaucher’s sufferers, a disproportionate number worked at jobs that required a high level of intelligence, such as engineers, physicists, and scientists.77 Furthermore, the concept behind the study is no longer unreasonable, as recent studies have shown that the brain has continued to evolve adaptively, growing in size,78 and that brain size is related to intelligence. 79

But, can this theory explain why Jewish diseases have not been erased by natural selection? Though the Cochran theory may seem far-fetched, many mainstream geneticists support his theory over Risch’s theory of genetic drift and founder effect, as they agree that it would be unlikely that four sphingolipid diseases would be randomly common to Jews.80 As Harvard University cognitive scientist Steven Pinker said, “It would be hard to overstate how politically incorrect this paper is, but it's certainly a thorough and well-argued paper, not one that can easily be dismissed outright.""81

After describing this groundbreaking and extremely controversial study, though probably not at the depth readers would like, Entine discusses the potentially shared genetic lineage of Jews and Palestinians, another controversial subject. In the appendix, he includes a list of Jewish diseases, methods for obtaining one’s own DNA breakdown, and a further review of genetics. And though Entine may not have fully addressed all of the controversial aspects of new scientific studies, the notes to the book reveal a wealth of articles and books that elaborate upon the subject.

After its release, critics applauded Entine’s careful review of Jewish history and culture, though some admitted that despite his best efforts, In his attempt to give us a full picture of the events comprising Jewish history, the author sometimes wanders. 82 They were also quick to point out some carelessness in his DNA analysis and scientific sections, saying that his account of genetic science and DNA analysis is vague. 83 Another review also cites its less than solid science, nonetheless maintaining its status as a quite interesting read.84 Kirkus Reviews called it an epic tale of The Chosen People and cautions that because the author’s approach is broad and inclusive, the book is sure to cause controversy, but it serves as an excellent catalyst for discussion as many continue to ask the question, What does it mean to be Jewish? 85 This is wholly true of Entine’s work; though it broadly addresses many issues, its true value lies in the questions that it raises.

Despite Entine’s efforts to tout the book as the next controversial assertion of Jewish intelligence, it became more of a historical primer in Jewish history and identity. Perhaps the scientific evidence was not strong enough, as attested to by many of the book’s reviewers, but those who hoped for a review of the controversial, if shaky, science surrounding the links between Jewish genes, intelligence, and disease may be disappointed. Overall, however, the book is an interesting glimpse into the issues surrounding Jewish identity, and the notes provide access to an incredible collection of resources. As the world becomes more and more interconnected, there are fewer isolated populations like the Ashkenazi Jews, and now is the time to study, learn, and write about them. Though the book may leave the reader with more questions than answers, perhaps that is the point.",0,0,0,13.71,31431
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Seeking Hope at Home,"Extensive research has documented how neighborhood conditions affect life outcomes. Entire fields of sociological study are devoted to exploring the ways in which people from areas of concentrated poverty share certain challenges. In light of their work, most researchers agree that the location of a person's home will shape many facets of their life. The discovery underscores the importance of crafting fair housing policy in the United States. Unfortunately, segregation by class and race has persisted throughout the twentieth century. African-Americans in particular have struggled since the Great Depression to find adequate housing. Their efforts have been complicated at times by whites, who have used a variety of tactics to prevent blacks from settling in or near certain neighborhoods. The judicial system supplied some remedies to end these discriminatory acts but most cases had a limited impact because the deciding opinions were narrowly tailored, allowing individuals to carve loopholes into the language. To an extent, the 1948 Supreme Court case of Shelley v. Kraemer was an exception for its strong, unanimous opinion. Though it came under fire for its reasoning, the opinion was still regarded as a clear indictment of discriminatory housing policies and emboldened blacks as the Civil Rights Era dawned. For the first time, it provided fair housing advocates a legal foundation upon which they could galvanize change, prompting them to push harder for reform than ever before. The Shelley decision did not end a movement but rather sparked one by infusing energy and confidence into fair housing advocates who suddenly enjoyed the backing of Constitutional law.

African-Americans have endured problems trying to secure adequate housing since the beginning of the twentieth century. Demographic changes have only exacerbated the difficulties. In the 1920s, blacks migrated from the rural South to the urban North in huge numbers as the agricultural economy faltered and the industrial economy strengthened. While seeking work in the factory towns throughout the Midwest and Northeast, blacks settled in the nation's major urban centers, such as St. Louis, New York, and Detroit (Meyer 32). Racial tensions escalated as the soaring demand for housing pushed whites and blacks into closer proximity than ever before. Whites grew afraid the growing black population would drive down property values and began taking steps to drive the new arrivals further from their neighborhoods. The push only heightened tensions and often led to violent disagreements. For example, in Detroit, a mob attacked the home of Ossian Sweet, the lone African-American on a certain block (Meyer 38). The confrontation ignited clashes throughout the city, foreshadowing the many battles that would ensue in the coming years over the integration of neighborhoods.

The housing crisis in urban centers did not improve with the onset of World War II when cities transformed their factories to start producing huge quantities of military arsenal. The new jobs accompanying the change prompted an even larger black migration northward and increased demand for housing in an already tight market. With the housing crisis growing more acute by the year, whites started insulating themselves from the prospect of homelessness or black encroachment. For decades, they had been forming neighborhood associations that could enforce restrictive covenants, which would protect neighborhood assets and keep blacks at a distance. Restrictive covenants took the form of an appendix or article in the deed not to sell, rent, or lease property to minority groups (Jones-Correa 544). They are private agreements written by homeowners to keep certain individuals out of particular neighborhoods. They had the practical effect of overtly discriminating against blacks and limiting their choices in the housing market.

Restrictive covenants were not the only tactic employed by whites to unfairly distort the housing market. City governments also incorporated racial zoning into city planning, which were laws that explicitly forbid blacks from settling in certain sections of a city (Jones-Correa 548). The Supreme Court struck down such ordinances in 1917 in the case of Buchanan v. Warley. The justices ruled the ordinances an unfair display of state power that deprived citizens of their individual property rights as guaranteed by the Constitution because they precluded blacks from fully exploring all their housing options (Meyer 26). The Buchanan case did little to actually open the housing market, however, because the decision applied only to state governments. Real estate agents could still steer blacks from certain neighborhoods because they were part of a private enterprise. Since restrictive covenants were also the result of private agreements, they too were still allowed under the decision. Only racial zoning, as an act by a public governing body, was banned, which meant other forms of housing discrimination could continue.

Restrictive covenants were formally challenged in the judicial system in the early 1920s, but the Supreme Court did not offer much relief for blacks then either. In the case of Corrigan v. Buckley, the Court concluded covenants were permissible because each citizen possesses the power to decide who to sell their property too, and the government should not attach any stipulations to such private exchanges. The Constitutional right of a Negro to acquire, own, and occupy property does not carry with it the constitutional power to compel sale and conveyance to him of any particular private property. The individual citizen, whether he be black or white, may refuse to sell or lease his property to any particular individual or class of individuals (Corrigan v. Buckley). Even if discrimination exists, the courts do not hold the power to remedy the situation because no laws mandate whites must consult with blacks before selling their property. In a free market, individuals enjoy the liberty to dispense with their possessions as they see fit without outside interference. Many viewed the decision and its rationale as validation that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause did not extend to private actions (Cahen 724). In matters of criminal law, everyone shares certain protections, but they do not stretch to cover economic activity. The Corrigan decision enabled whites to continue discriminating against blacks and keep them out of their neighborhoods with restrictive covenants. As a result, blacks remained confined to certain sections of cities that were increasingly overcrowded. Despite the deteriorating conditions, the situation was overshadowed throughout the 1930s by the country's economic turmoil. Not until 1940 did the NAACP adopt a formal strategy to address the housing issue and its blatant, discriminatory elements (Meyer 56).

The NAACP launched a two front attack in 1940 to secure fair housing rights for blacks. In part, they would lobby local and state governments, but their main tactic was to bring housing cases before the federal judiciary that could be tried on constitutional grounds. Over the next decade, lawsuits were filed throughout the country to challenge the legality of racial covenants. The first of these to reach the Supreme Court was Hansberry v. Lee in 1940. White owners of a tenement in Chicago had threatened a black man, Hansberry, to move off the premises shortly after his arrival. The white owners claimed a covenant denied him a right to occupy the space. The Court found Hansberry actually could live in the building, a victory for the NAACP, but the win proved to be symbolic. The justices ruled only on a technicality…and did not rule on racial deed indentures, nor challenge the Corrigan precedent (Meyer 56). The Court instead found that the original covenant did not include the required number of signers to qualify as enforceable. Rather than banning all covenants, the justices merely voided a single one. The decision did not address any Constitutional questions so it had little practical effect, although it did provide the NAACP with a moral victory on principle.

The NAACP continued to press cases involving covenants throughout the decade, but the Supreme Court did not hear another appeal pertaining to the covenant issue until 1948 when they merged the cases of Shelley v. Kraemer and McGhee v. Sipes. The Shelley case originated in St. Louis when a black couple, the Shelleys, bought a home on a white block and were promptly sued by the neighborhood association. The NAACP recognized it as an opportunity to force a final confrontation on the covenant issue and took up the case. The first ruling came down in the Shelley's favor, but the Supreme Court of Missouri sided with the neighborhood association, identified as Kraemer because that family had signed the original covenant (Meyer 92). The case then proceeded to the Supreme Court where six justices heard arguments on its merits in January of 1948. In May of 1948, the six justices who heard the Shelley case offered a unanimous opinion, authored by Fred Vinson, which, in effect, outlawed racial covenants.

The Supreme Court's decision in Shelley v. Kraemer was finely parsed. The justices made two key rulings, one on the validity of racial covenants and another on the right of states to enforce them. The first finding was actually a blow to blacks. The justices decided that racial covenants were permissible under provisions in the Constitution, a ruling they based upon the conclusions reached in the Buchanan case (Shelley v. Kraemer). Precedence carried great weight in their view. In affirming those earlier decisions, the justices affirmed that the Constitution allowed for covenants because they are contracts between private entities. That (Fourteenth) Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful (Shelley v. Kraemer). The opinion reflected a common deference the Court still exhibits today to respect prior decisions. Justices are often weary of invalidating the findings of their predecessors, a practice which has caused inertia in the system and introduced the Latin term stare decisis, let it stand, into the legal lexicon.

The justices were not truly willing to let racial covenants stand in the Shelley case. After reaching their first conclusion on the validity of the private contracts, the justices continued to delve deeper into the matter because there was more beyond just contracts. Private citizens had drawn up the terms in covenants, but those individuals were not the sole enforcer of the deed. In many situations, the judiciary had also played a role in the implementation of the agreements. The plaintiffs in the case, the Shelleys, claimed the judiciary's involvement amounted to a State action, which would have violated the law under Buchanan v. Buckley (Shelley v. Kraemer). The justices agreed on the grounds that the decision of a state court is, in effect, a state action because their prescriptions must be carried out by a state official. That the action of state courts and of judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment (Shelley v. Kraemer). The justices again invoked the Fourteenth Amendment. This time, though, they pointed toward the equal protection clause, which mandates states provide equitable shelters against discrimination or abuse for all citizens. In shifting focusing from the due process clause, which had been at the center of earlier covenant cases, to the equal protection clause, the 1948 Supreme Court found legal ground on which to ban racial covenants. An examination of the definition of state action was the crucial feature in their opinion because it enabled them to discover enforcement of racial covenants by state courts constitutes state action prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment (McGraw and Nesbitt 280). It was an innovative line of legal reasoning, but the Court needed to adopt a novel approach to render racial covenants unconstitutional given earlier precedent. We hold that in granting judicial enforcement of the restrictive agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the equal protection of the laws and that, therefore, the action of the state courts cannot stand (Shelley v. Kraemer).

The NAACP again celebrated their victory at the Supreme Court, particularly because it was viewed as more consequential due its grounding in constitutional law. Still, the decision had limits because covenants had not been explicitly banned, only their enforcement by state officials (McGraw and Nesbitt 280). Furthermore, the Court's definition of state action confused many in the judiciary.  Shelley v. Kraemer injected something new into the state action doctrine of the fourteenth amendment (Cahen 727). The Court revised precisely what constituted a legal action on the part of the state. The Court did not clearly define all activities that would be included under this new umbrella, but instead referenced just one, a choice that opened up the prospect for new legal challenges in a variety of other cases. Plaintiffs and defendants could suddenly begin examining government actions and search for maneuvers that would qualify as unconstitutional. It was a scary prospect for lower courts, which were left to sort out the mess. At least initially, many of them simply refused to jump into the debate. Instead, most courts (refused) to give effect to the full scope of the decision, many of them either ignoring Shelley or summarily dismissing it (Cahen 727). Lower courts could not decipher the justice's intent in the decision outside their desire to ban covenants. Rather than trying to re-write the law on their own, they just fell back on old statutes when assessing state action. In spite of the civil rights advance Shelley was actually damaging to the judicial system due to its vaguely defined decision.

The Court's convoluted opinion sowed much confusion into the judicial system, a reality that reflected the justice's desire to correct an egregious violation of citizen rights in spite of little legal basis. The justices knew racial covenants should be outlawed, but they struggled to find solid lines of judicial reasoning in support. Therefore, they rationalized in order to achieve a morally justified outcome (Strauss 975). A similar conundrum consistently faced courts throughout the civil rights era as they settled other discrimination suits. It was difficult to strike a balance between protecting private rights, such as when the owner of a personal business wants to set company policy, and protecting constitutional liberties, such as allowing every individual to frequent that business (Strauss 976). The Shelley case represented merely the first attempt at reaching the delicate equilibrium. As such, the decision was examined frequently for direction on the matter, and subsequent rulings used narrowly reasoned lines of thinking to justify choices that, while morally correct, were legally questionable.

The strained legal reasoning in the Shelley case created an opening for citizens still vehemently opposed to open housing to craft policies that would keep blacks out of their neighborhoods. Despite the rulings, discrimination did not fade quickly in the housing market. Neighborhood associations revised the wording in some of their mortgage contracts in order to replace references to race, which were unconstitutional, with references to certain types of unwanted individuals (Sugrue 222). Implicit in the wording was an understanding blacks would not qualify. In addition, lending institutions became reluctant to grant loans to blacks if they intended to move into a white neighborhood (Meyer 116). The practice, which was labeled redlining, became a form of de facto segregation with blacks still being relegated to only certain sections of cities. The end result was that in the decade following the Shelley decision Blacks remained overwhelming concentrated in the central city (Darden 681). Most still lacked equal access to the real estate market.

The housing situation began improving incrementally during the 1960s as the civil rights movement gained momentum. Two crucial factors played a role. First, President Kennedy shifted the housing issue into the public spotlight shortly after taking office. He signed an Executive Order that outlawed discrimination on the part of lenders or landlords. It also mandated the federal government practice fair housing principles in its public housing units (Meyer 169). The Executive Order had come after years of aggressive lobbying by the NAACP. Once the organization had identified housing as a central issue, they started pressuring legislatures throughout the country and promoted individuals within the system that would advance the cause. The efforts cultivated a favorable policy environment for Kennedy's order, which marked the first time that the federal executive had declared its support for the philosophy of open housing (Meyer 171). Unfortunately, the pronouncement did not cure all problems in the marketplace. The government agencies responsible for enforcing the regulations never applied the scrutiny necessary to ensure all states and municipalities followed the guidelines. Plus, the housing industry and homeowners kept resisting the reforms. Still, the open housing movement had been placed on the national agenda. It was clear the issue had to be resolved.

Civil Rights activists in the 1960s situated open housing as a central plank in their equality campaigns of the decade. Community organization played an increasingly active role in keeping the public's attention fixed on the issue too. Grassroots activists coordinated conscious political efforts with broad community support (Yates 218) to demonstrate against the housing injustices. Major leaders in the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr., and the NAACP also kept pressure on authorities by organizing marches in metropolitan centers throughout the North and Midwest. Marches were planned in Chicago and Detroit to highlight the problem and demand a fair resolution that drew thousands of supporters (Meyer 183). With so much emphasis placed on the issue, housing was conflated with the entire civil rights movement, and when the landmark struggle finally achieved its legislative goals in 1968, housing was not forgotten. Part of President Johnson's Great Society platform included passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which codified into federal law equitable treatment in the housing market and the ban on covenants blacks had been seeking for decades (Yates 218).

The signing of the Fair Housing Act did not mark the end of residential segregation. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s black segregation actually increased (Darden 683). Blacks remained isolated from whites throughout the country and still endured great difficulties when trying to buy a home. Segregation remained intact with whites settling in the suburbs and blacks concentrated in urban neighborhoods. Regardless of socioeconomic status most blacks remain highly segregated in central cities of metropolitan areas (Darden 684). Part of the problem can be attributed to discriminatory selling practices. The unfair treatment of blacks common in the first half of the twentieth century still prevailed. Housing audit studies show high levels of direct racial discrimination by realtors and landlords against African-Americans…There is mounting evidence that mortgage lenders discriminate against African-Americans (Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith 18). The practices lenders and realtors now employ to steer blacks from certain neighborhoods are more discrete but have equally as pernicious consequences as those used earlier in the century. They also produce the same effect of keeping blacks from settling in particular sections of a city.

The most common form of discrimination against blacks in housing today is mortgage redlining. Similar to FHA policies in the 1950s, redlining today involves the denial of credit to low income or minority communities (Silverman). Many studies have shown that minorities do not have the same access to credit as their white counterparts unless they choose to locate in specific areas. Blacks are encouraged to move into only a few communities. Often these neighborhoods are undergoing demographic shifts so that within a few years they will comprise mainly of minority residents (Silverman). Redlining constitutes a form of de facto segregation. Even though many laws explicitly outlaw discrimination in housing, race still plays a role in the process. The same tactics adopted decades ago in response to Shelley are still being used today although not as overtly. The racial composition of neighborhoods remains a significant factor in the lending process (Silverman). Lax oversight has allowed the situation to reach the point where discrimination is still a pressing issue. The country has come a long way, but segregation still exists, just in modified forms.

It is unfortunate race still plays such a prominent role in so many facets of the American experience. Despite the existence of some disparities, it would be false to insinuate the country has failed to make progress on this issue. It should be noted, however, that most advances blacks make are met with resistance. Those with power generally can develop new ways to keep the system tilted in their favor. There is a clear narrative throughout the housing story that displays this reality. When racial zoning was deemed unconstitutional in the Buchanan v. Warley case, racial covenants proliferated. Then, in the 1950s, redlining became the primary mode of discrimination, in part, to subvert the Supreme Court's Shelley v. Kraemer decision. Today redlining still exists, though federal authorities are improving their oversight of the problem. In response, other methods have surfaced that prey upon blacks looking for a new home. Some unscrupulous mortgage lenders have targeted blacks seeking credit that have limited access to other lines due to lingering and misguided concerns about their ability to make payments. The deals offered through these outlets contain unfavorable terms with interest rates that escalate quickly, leaving homeowners unable to pay the bills. As a result, some families have drowned in debt. The fact a large number of them are minorities shows there are still elements of the housing market in need of reform before the system qualifies as fully fair and equitable.

The current housing turmoil that resulted from predatory lending attests to the need for additional scrutiny and oversight of the industry. Many of the problems that have plagued housing throughout the century are the result of lax enforcement. Had the federal government properly followed the Court's wishes in the Shelley decision, the discrimination of the 1950s might have been reduced. Similarly, if the federal bureaucracy was more willing to implement the policies of President Kennedy's open housing orders, then the need for a mass movement in the latter half of the 1960s might have been diminished. Today, increased oversight of the financial community might result in improved standards that minimize predatory lending while opening avenues for minority investment. The current disregard in government for such a move reflects the bureaucracy's general apathy toward housing issues. The repeated failure of the government to address the problem has incited many activists to push the issue. Without their enthusiasm, many gains in housing would never have materialized. Organizers and firebrands deserve the most recognition for pushing the open housing movement forward. The judicial system has offered limited support and only in brief instances.

It is interesting when studying the open housing movement to note that the Supreme Court's seminal decision on the subject, Shelley v. Kraemer, did not so much victoriously conclude the movement as galvanize it. Previously, the Court's rulings had helped perpetuate racist housing practices. Decisions in Buchanan, Corrigan, and Hansberry had the effect of institutionalizing covenants and providing a sort of government endorsement. In 1948, when the Court was willing to reconsider its past decisions, the justice's authoritative voice had the opposite effect. It threw the weight of law and government behind open housing advocates and their arguments. The newfound support provided the impetus that permanently situated open housing on the nation's agenda. The NAACP had done a good job keeping the issue alive by pushing many cases forward, but they had yet to achieve a monumental victory that could spark a broader movement and bolster flagging morale. Shelley provided that boost, not so much because of how its prescriptions equalized the market but because of the moral authority it added to the group's activities. Disparities still existed in the housing market, but the public started realizing for the first time the blatant discrimination was truly a betrayal of the country's ideals.

With the knowledge that the Supreme Court was now squarely on their side, activists pressed forward to finally resolve the problem of discrimination in housing. They struggled throughout the 1950s to gain traction, but President Kennedy supplied another lift with his Executive Order. It gave all the organizers hope once again. It proved to those toiling at a grassroots level that success was possible. And so they kept pressing the issue with marches and speeches and events. It was through these local campaigns that people began to recognize the urgent need for housing reform. Eventually, the efforts paid off with the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The calls had become too loud. The Shelley decision's moral challenge from the Supreme Court to end discriminatory housing policies finally translated into a legislative initiative twenty years after the fact. The only reason it remained a priority in the intermittent decades was the vigorous participation of citizens concerned about the subject.

Today, grassroots advocates are still seeking to construct an equitable housing system. Small entities, such as Community Development Corporations and ACORN branches, are the primary vehicles. They maintain the legacy of local organizers that pushed so vehemently for increased accessibility to housing earlier in the century. There has been progress, but injustices remain. The history of the open housing struggle encapsulates the fluidity of the social change process. Not one actor or branch of government alone can catalyze a movement. Nor is there a single chain of events that leads to substantive changes. Rather, there is always a mix of turning points, activists, and policies that contribute. In some situations, like the open housing case, the judiciary offers a needed endorsement on the merits of an issue that propels a movement forward. In other situations, the courts render a final verdict that effectively marks the conclusion of an activist group's long journey. It all depends on the circumstance. And that is the critical point. Circumstance dictates strategy in a social movement. It is impossible to determine when a turning point will arrive in the scheme, but one can easily chart a course that brings it closer to realization. The key is to keep moving forward in spite of setbacks and always be prepared to adjust tactics. Without resilience and flexibility nothing can be accomplished. They are the two most important ingredients for creating social change.",47.06,23.57,13.57,10.3,27748
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Union Now!: Day Care Providers' Fight for Representation,"The unifying theme that linked together all of the various topics that we covered throughout this course was unambiguous from the beginning; how the legal process can impact the political process, specifically through grass roots organizing and a coordinated public relations campaign, in order to produce a desired social change. While most of my classmates will invariably follow this rather simple frame work by identifying a specific court case that sparked a movement, I have chosen a different route.

After consulting with Professor Bernstein, as well as by paying special attention to a few of the lectures that stood out in my mind, I have come to realize that the framework is too simple. Social change, and how the legal and political processes intersect with it, is much more nuanced in practice. The theoretical framework ignores the many social activists such as Mirna Torres that work to achieve change before being sparked by a specific court case. To this end, I will study and analyze the largest successful union organizing drive New York has seen in 45 years. A movement that I was lucky enough to take a part in.

Similar to many states, New York's comprehensive public assistance program includes subsidies for childcare for families with children ages 2-12. The subsidy by and large takes the form of vouchers that eligible families use either towards a day care center, or an at home day care provider. The providers as they are commonly referred to take care of anywhere from 1-12 children, and receive payment from a local agency, with New York City's Administration for Children's' Services (ACS) covering 28,000 within the 5 boroughs alone. While the majority of the money is underwritten by the federal government, it travels through the hands of state agencies enroot to the municipal organization (ACS) before it finally reaches the provider. [Here on out I will specifically be referring to providers that live within New York City. There is a separate drive being undertaken by a different union to organize the non NYC, New York State providers.] In addition to the subsidy payment, the majority of providers [again in NYC] are enrolled in an additional state run food program administered by the New York State Department of Health. This analogous program reimburses providers for meals they feed their children, as a way of ensuring proper nutrition. Together these two programs make up the bulk of the funds that providers are paid for their services.

With a basic understanding of the system from a top-down approach, we can now look at the arrangement from the bottom up, in order to best understand how providers earn a living. Providers are considered state paid independent contractors, and are thus in a status of legal limbo, as they have no collective bargaining rights. Providers, typically women, are either licensed, or informal. If licensed, they have gone through a rigorous training process and have had their house or apartment inspected by the New York City Dep't of Health in order to ensure adequate fire safety. Licensed providers are paid a higher rate per child than informal.

In terms of process, providers register with ACS, if licensed take the appropriate classes and get tested. From here they have the option of joining networks who serve as a middle man by linking providers with families. By law, the community based networks are supposed to perform oversight of their respective providers, yet in reality little is done. Finally, the Providers are paired up with children in their neighborhood, and continue serving the children until they either opt out of the program, find a new provider, reach the age of 13, or their parent stops working, which makes the child ineligible.

Understanding both perspectives of the organizational structure, it is pertinent to understand the financial implications of being a provider, as well as the challenges that they face. Of all NYC Providers, the average salary is $19,933 (Whitt). For this work, they receive no benefits, no paid vacation, no professional development, and no sick days. On average providers work 5-6 days a week, and their work day varies per provider, yet a 7am-8pm day is not uncommon. In terms of pay, providers are paid on a per child per day basis, and thus the longer the hours per day the child is in care, the less money per hour the provider is paid. This often leads to sub-minimum wage salaries. Yet providers face myriad of other problems.

Informal providers look towards attaining their license as a way of moving up. Licensed providers are not only paid more per child, but are eligible to take care of more children, thus drastically increasing their salary potential. Yet acquiring the license is far from a walk in the park. Classes needed towards licensing are prohibitively expensive. Costing hundreds if not thousands for the required courses, the poorly paid women often have serious difficulty raising the required funds. Further, the classes are offered sparingly and usually only during normal business hours, which directly conflicts with standard day care hours.

Moving on, ACS, which handles the providers from a city-stand point, is extremely under staffed. When providers call for assistance they will typically receive busy signals for hours on end. As part of a research project this summer I was supposed to keep a call log of average wait time on the ACS switch board. Over the course of a 10 hour work day, calling every 15 minutes, I did not get through once. Even when providers are able to finally speak to a representative, it usually takes weeks to solve pressing issues.

Further, providers face serious issues with their respective networks. While networks are supposed to provide oversight in the form of classes, on the spot inspections and administrative oversight, little if any of this is done. While some networks are better than others, most simply serve as referral services. For this they receive what is referred to as the network fee, which comes out to $17 dollars per child per week. Originally this was covered by the City, underwritten by the federal government. This is to be expected, as the City was more or less contracting out oversight responsibilities to the private networks. Yet a few years ago as a cost saving measure, the City transferred the network fees to the provider. In a sense, the current system has the already underpaid providers paying private organizations money to conduct federally mandated oversight. The system is just this perverse.

Beyond this, city health inspectors often give contradictory information on fire safety inspections, and the food program often fails to reimburse providers for expenses and doesn't have adequate safe-guards or appellate procedures. With all of these problems it isn't hard to understand why by 2005 providers were sick and tired of it all. Overworked, under paid and mistreated, providers began clamoring for change, and to their benefit they found partners that were all too willing to help.

With a firm grasp on the system that was in place and how the status quo was ill equipped for the providers, we can now move forward into the crux of the paper; how the providers created a social movement which forced political change and came full circle to lead to social change.

The Association of Communities Organizing for Reform Now! better known by the acronym ACORN is a nationwide full service social justice organization dedicated towards easing the plight for the working class. Some of their projects have included working through state referendums to increase the minimum wage, founding New York's progressive Working Families Party, advising new home owners on mortgage options, and pressing for better schools at all levels of education. By mid 2005 ACORN had identified the plight of the providers as a priority. Not only were the providers being ill treated, but as a result the children that they watched were entering school at a distinct disadvantage. While ACORN was, and continues to be extremely effective at organizing at the grass roots level, when it comes time to press politicians to take action, they are somewhat less skillful. In terms of the initial organizing drive in 2005, ACORN's lack of political clout within New York was fully felt, and the campaign never truly got off the ground.

However things quickly changed. By 2006 ACORN teamed up with its historical ally, New York City's teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers. ACORN and the UFT appeared to be adequately suited to compliment each others strengths and weaknesses. What political clout ACORN lacked, the UFT certainly had as one of, New York's most powerful unions. Further, ACORN was able to compliment the UFT's political strength with its grassroots organizing abilities. The pair was destined to succeed, and they immediately got to work.

Before analyzing the actual process of the movement, it is important to be realistic, and understand the underlying non altruistic reasons that each organization was willing to risk significant political and financial capital on such a movement. Early on the UFT recognized that if it could add 28,000 providers to their union rolls as a new chapter, than they could become that much more powerful. By increasing overall membership, UFT negotiators could leverage their electoral behavior during contract negotiations not only for the providers but for all teachers.

On the other hand, ACORN is a growing organization and always looking both for new members as well as accomplishments to put under its belt. A victory on such a big issue would clearly give it serious clout, and would enable the group to flex its muscle that much more later on. Beyond this, the ultimate goal was (and still is) to have the providers recognize the role that ACORN played, and eventually become full fledged dues paying members, allowing future growth.

As stated, the organizations involved decided early on that due to the legal status of the providers, the best way to support them was to have them join as a new chapter of the UFT. This would provide for collective bargaining rights, and would invariably lead to contract negotiations with improved salary and benefits. Yet from the onset, this appeared difficult. As independent workers contracted out by the state, it was illegal to unionize. To create a new chapter of the union, a number of steps needed to take place. First, the providers needed a change in their legal status. Following the lead of Illinois in 2005, providers needed to be considered state employees in order to attain collective bargaining rights. From here the actual work was needed to set up a union, and required various judicial oversight and recognition. This is the part where the courts come into play. While both aspects of the movement will be analyzed, it is important to understand that throughout the entire process, both the UFT and ACORN were dedicated agents of social activism working with the press and through the grass roots to create political change in order to affect social change.

This framework first played out in the political arena. After the UFT created an office led by senior organizer Fran Streich to lead the drive, they transferred funds to ACORN to accommodate hiring several organizers within the CLOC- Community Labor Organizing Committee. Together the two groups coordinated on a daily basis. Their immediate goal was to change the legal status of the providers. This could happen one of two ways. Either both houses of the NYS legislature could pass legislation then signed by the governor designating the change, or the governor would simply need to sign an executive order. The NYS Assembly is overwhelmingly Democratic, and thus posed no problem. Yet the Senate has historically been a Republican dominated chamber, as was the governor's mansion at the time. The UFT wrote off the governor as a lost cause, and began focusing its efforts on both legislative bodies. To do this, a coordinated organizing and public relations campaign was undertaken, which highlights one of the key aspects of the framework.

ACORN immediately hit the streets. Given a list of all providers with their address and phone numbers by ACS, ACORN began a major canvassing drive (see picture) dedicated towards raising awareness among the providers as well as identifying potential leadership. While there were some holdovers from the previous campaign, fresh blood was in need. Canvassers marched up and down all five boroughs in search of any provider that would listen, while the UFT got to work on the press side. After enough searching, CLOC and the UFT decided to begin holding organizing meetings within each borough. At this point the leaders decided that as they were going to be a union, it was important that not only were the providers the face of the struggle, but those actually calling the shots. This could be seen during the various meetings held throughout all of 2005 and all the way up to the summer of 2007 during the final push. While paid staffers would facilitate meetings and provide services, the idea that the providers had agency over the direction of the drive and their union was drilled to their core. The method of canvas → hold meetings → network out to other providers, quickly gained traction.

Figure here
Even before the major social demonstrations got underway, the political clout of the organizations involved as well as the successful grass roots activism forced local politicians to support the campaign. In one instance, immediately after the announcement of the formation of the campaign, [New York] City Councilman Bill de Blasio said he endorsed the day care providers' efforts to unionize (Greenhouse 2005).

As stated, leadership development was always on the minds of the organizers early on. Any time a new provider was contacted, the organizer conducting the outreach would make note of it, and assign a number correlating to their perceived potential leadership abilities. Anytime a 1 was reached, indicating that the provider was articulate, intelligent, well spoken, willing to dedicate time towards the campaign, and overall on board, they would be added to a special leadership list, contacted by the lead organizer and primed for future roles. Out all of the canvassing early on, four providers stuck out as exceptional leaders, with one, Tammie Miller being the clearly designated leader of the providers. The other three were encouraged to hire more assistants at their home, and basically move into the campaign in a full time capacity. The established political leadership of the movement was well aware that in order to be successful, the face of the campaign needed to be those directly affected.

To this effect, the ever growing yet still small core group of leaders met monthly with ACORN and UFT representatives and planned larger organizing meetings, held throughout New York. These meetings were open to the press, and were generally well covered. As the stories became more frequent, and were complimented by ever growing marches and small rallies, politicians at the state level took notice and acted accordingly. Only a few months into the campaign both the NYS Assembly, and even the conservative, Republican dominated Senate passed legislation allowing the providers to unionize by wide margins. All that was needed was a signature from the governor.

To this end the social activism that spurred the political component of the multi dimensional framework took the form of public rallies held outside of the offices where politicians worked. For example in May of 2006, in an effort to get Gov. Pataki to sign the legislation into law, Hundreds of child care providers rallied outside Gov. George Pataki's Midtown office … to urge the governor to sign legislation allowing them to join a union and to negotiate with the state. (Whitt 2006). Yet the UFT had overplayed its hand. Pataki was a lame duck governor, far from indebted to progressive activists and teachers. He vetoed the bill. The coalition next turned its attention towards pushing the legislature to override the veto. Again the social change aspect of the campaign as expressed through the grassroots picks up again. Providers were told to call into legislators' offices and demand they override the veto. To some extent this worked, as the Assembly held to it's word, yet as expected the Senate failed to override their fellow Republican. With defeat looming, the providers took sight on the incoming governor, Elliot Spitzer during his campaign. On the campaign trail heavy lobbying pushed Spitzer into promising that once in office he would simply offer an executive order changing the provider's status. From the moment he was sworn in on January 1st 2007, the providers through the UFT an ACORN coordinated a non-stop political, grass roots, and public relations blitz, forcing the governor to keep his word. Lobbying by allied politicians who simply saw the grass roots power as a way to move up the political chain, more rallies and marches as well as press releases all forced Sptizer to action.

All of the efforts paid off, and on May 12, 2007 Gov. Spitzer signed his 12th Executive Order, which stated that … New York State shall recognize as the representative of the child care providers… such representative as is designated by a majority of the providers…

Figure here
(Sptizer 2007, Lovett 2007). In effect a legal path was laid out which allowed the provider to start the actual process towards unionization. To this date, the social movement through its rallies, marches, and coordinated public relations campaign had achieved its first and most difficult objective, creating a social movement that would create political change. As the movement forged on, the scene of battle changed from the governor's mansion to the courtroom.
As laid out in the executive order, Any prospective representative may demonstrate majority designation by submitting authorization cards approving its representation (Sptizer 2007). To achieve representation status, the group needed to submit authorization cards from 50% plus one of registered providers. If they reached over 30%, yet failed to hit the 50% threshold, an automatic election would be required among all eligible providers as laid out by the bylaws of the State Employment Relations Board (SERB) in conjunction with the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS).

As the next step in the campaign, the leadership immediately took stock of available options. In an effort to increase the potential union's political clout, as well as further ensure continued political support, it was decided that the providers would intentionally undercut the 50% rate, in order to trigger an election. The election was viewed as a means of showing policy makers their strength in numbers. A goal of 12,000 authorization cards was set, halfway in between the 30 and 50% thresholds. From May until early June the campaign focused all of its efforts on this goal.

Figure here
In order to impress not only SERB (a quasi judicial body in its own right) but the presiding state judge in Albany whose duty it was to certify the authorization cards, a similar social movement was created. Leadership meetings were followed by borough meetings followed by city wide meetings followed be more meetings followed by rallies, etc. The campaign was in full swing and providers were issued their authorization cards. The campaign kept careful track of the numbers game and by early June had amassed over 12,000 cards to be sent to the judge upstate. What ensued next was some of the most trying weeks. As expected, serious negotiations as to the validity over the cards took place in the courtroom. As providers are paid so little, the program is more or less a revolving door, and identifying who is a currently registered provider was rather difficult. Yet with political capital, legal maneuvering, and a publicity stunt where the authorization cards were literally wheeled to the court (see picture), the state judge certified the cards in June. After negotiations between the UFT, SERB, OCFS, and the judge, an election was called between September and October of 2007. The mail in election required a simple majority of votes to be yes votes in order to qualify for representation, yet the union wanted to make a splash.

Figure here
Throughout the summer activist providers such as Jenny Rivera in Manhattan and Melvina Vandross in The Bronx (see below) aided by community organizers from ACORN (including myself) canvassed the 5 boroughs raising awareness of the upcoming election. More public rallies were held all over the city, and providers were encouraged to reach out to each other, as well as hold local house meetings. The VOTE YES campaign kicked off at a major rally in Harlem on Aug. 28th where a myriad of politicians addressed the boisterous crowd of providers clamoring for a union. The slogan throughout the summer was Union Now- Vote Yes/ Union Ahora Vote Si!

As the election rolled around the social movement was gaining strength, and providers from all five boroughs became more involved than ever. While voting was an arduous task, by the time SERB and the state court certified all ballots, the final vote was 8,382 to 96, a resounding victory!

Figure here
By the end of October the state court had validated the election and the UFT was officially named the representative of the providers in NYC. While the whole process was arduous, and is still ongoing we can look at the genesis of events and understand how a social movement led by the providers and ACORN/UFT through a concerted grassroots and public relations campaign, forced politicians to action, and the courts to follow suit. While not working exactly within the framework, the providers' success was the biggest union organizing drive in NY in decades and will surely serve as a framework for future campaigns. Yet where does this leave the providers?

Unionization was merely a means towards and end, better working conditions and benefits. Throughout the summer as the election looked more and more like an assured victory, the UFT head organizer began preparing for contract negotiations. In my capacity, I worked some of the time in the field, and some of the time as a researcher identifying potential bargaining points and positions. Contract negotiations are currently underway, and will probably be for a long time, as they are quite complex. The fiscal reality explained earlier in terms of how the program is underwritten by the federal government through various agencies leads to many regulations and conditions that are difficult for even policy makers to truly understand. There exist many ambiguities within the many levels of law corresponding to the providers that need to be understood before a contract will be reached. However the providers can expect a few things for sure.

First and foremost, a pay increase. [To the best of my knowledge] The federal government sets the market rate with which providers are allowed to charge private parents for day care. From here, the State sets a benchmark percentage of this as the rate that they will reimburse providers for taking care of subsidized children. This is the area ripe for negotiation. While some states offer providers close to 100% of the private rate, New York has settled on 75% to the best of my knowledge (this information is difficult to access and analyze without access to private documents located in NY). I predict that after negotiations the percentage reimbursed will increase possibly 5-10%. Additionally, it would be entirely in the realm of possibility for the $17 network oversight fee to be transferred out of the provider's hands possible back to the City. However, state regulations make this uncertain. Additionally, benefits should become a reality, with an inclusion of sick days as well as better professional development and a better staffed ACS. This is all currently being sorted out. Yet a new contract is far from the only practical ramifications of unionization.

While the state government was eager to help the providers, local City policy makers were quite opposed. Mayor Michael Bloomberg was adamantly opposed to unionization. With some validity, he argued that by increasing the per-provider salary, yet without the State transferring more funds to the city for subsidies, there will exist a windfall possibly in the neighborhood of $100 million. With NYC in a poor fiscal state, this could invariably lead to fewer providers being allowed to register. In economic terms, by raising the wage you create a surpluses of labor, yet limited resources mandate fewer providers, so we will have a shortfall of open spots. In the end the children who are not allowed to attend daycare could truly suffer. Yet this is all hypothetical.

In terms of the organizations involved, the UFT has grown to epic proportions. They now represent 128,000 members, and have increased their budget significantly as well. This could lead to even greater political power in NY, as well as greater leverage in future non-provider teacher contract negotiations. Likewise, ACORN has new members, greater political capital, as well as heightened awareness of the organization. In reality this was a win-win-win-win-win-lose situation. With the UFT, ACORN, providers, the kids, and the governor winning, with only the networks, who had been paid to perform oversight they were not conducting probably losing out in the end.

The campaign was a scripted, coordinated movement that in reality had few surprises along the way. The intelligent and seasoned organizers gamed out most scenarios, and planned every detail extremely effectively. In my opinion there were few unforeseen consequences in terms of the campaign. I would offer that there is the potential for the program to move NYC into the red. If forced to provide more money to the programs, it would in a sense be an unfunded mandate, and the City could try and either undercut the contract, transfer more costs to the providers, or simply refuse to register new providers as to stagnate their budget.

While the possibility of adverse affects is real, the overall movement was a wild success. The providers are a great example of how the grass roots, working with the press can utilize social change to force political and legal change which in the end creates changes within society for the better of tens of thousands of providers and hundreds of thousands of children, and I am proud to say that I was a part of the process.",0,16.07,21.34,10.5,26675
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,"""The Blocking Machine""","Reflective of an intensely competitive and high stakes campaign season, the 2004 South Dakota Senatorial election was bitterly contested and notable for its divisively negative tactics. The race pitted former Republican Congressman John Thune against the incumbent Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. Among the several oppositional ads the candidates broadcasted to South Dakota voters, Congressman Thune ran a particularly unique soft sell critique of his opponent. The Blocking Machine, as the ad was titled, interpolates Senator Daschle into an old time football highlight replete with sepia tone, newsreel style voiceover and a generic fight song playing in the background. Clocking in at just under a minute, 59.9 seconds, The Blocking Machine uses irony to portray Daschle as out of touch with his constituency in an attempt to generate feelings of disgust and anger among viewers. The ad's harsh negativity and irreverent style may have disheartened uncommitted voters, but its emotive appeals ultimately proved effective in engaging a conservative base fruitful enough to sway the election.

The Blocking Machine employs a soft sell approach in appealing to a viewers sense of irony in order to generate negative conceptions of Senator Daschle. The light hearted nature of the advertisement is set immediately as viewers are treated to what appears to be an old style football highlight reel. The beginning of the ad indicates that the following spot will be a biopic about a member of The greatest blocking line of all time, which also includes Ted Kennedy at left tackle, Hillary Clinton, playing really left tackle, Barbara Boxer positioned at way left tackle, and the star Tom the blocking machine Daschle listed at extremely left tackle. As the word left serves as Condensation Symbol synonymous with liberal, it mocks those it describes for perceived extreme views. Furthermore positioning United States Senators in a completely atypical context creates a humorous aura and makes them appear particularly foolish. Senator Kennedy, who like the others has his face superimposed upon a football player's body, is displayed with a gaping mouth that highlights his wide jaw line and makes him appear goofily ill-tempered.

The Videostyle, as defined by Lynda Lee Kaid and Dorothy K. Davidson, reinforces the ad's ironic tone.. The verbal communication utilized by the ad is the first Kaidian indicator of sarcasm that ridicules Daschle, the narrator's voice is one associated with an old time newsreel. While his inflection alone is jocular to the point of mockery, the narrator proceeds to detail Daschle as blocking beneficial pieces of legislation with the intonation of a sportscaster observing a spectacular Tom Harmon touchdown run, raising his cadence each time he repeats the buzzword blocked! Furthermore, the fight song in the background recalls a bygone era and befits the theme of Senator Daschle's success in preventing desired legislation from being passed. On-screen text, another important aspect of Kaid and Davidson's elements of Videostyle, is used prolifically in irony with the ad, of course, opening with The Blocking Machine displayed across the screen. Throughout the spot the word blocked appears in bold three times.

While the ironic tone set by the ad's production makes Daschle appear a fool, the ad's overarching purpose is to highlight Daschle as out of touch with his constituents. For the brief 1.6 seconds at the beginning of the ad that Thune appears on screen, in which he says I'm John Thune and I approve this message, the challenger is made to look like the common man. In accordance with Kaid and Davidson conclusions, Thune adopts the common challenger attire of casual dress. Relaxingly leaning against a tree, Thune sports a flannel shirt tucked into a pair of blue jeans. Behind him lies a picturesque landscape of tall trees and green forestry interrupted only by an American flag waving at full mast in the light wind beside what appears to be a Revolutionary era cannon pointed away from the camera. During this brief screen shot, Thune appears to embody the image of a regular guy as well certain values such as patriotism and a comfort in South Dakota's landscape. Once Thune is established during this short moment as a man of the people the rest of the ad seeks to establish Daschle as out of touch.

Immediately Thune starts his attack on Daschle through verbal and visual association, one of eight principles of advertising enumerated by Darrell West. The narrator explains that Daschle is a member of The Greatest Blocking Line of All Time along with Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton and Barbara Boxer. More than a simple association with other Democrats, however, these Senators in particular were chosen because they served as Condensation Symbols, as defined by Doris Graber, which seek to stir vivid impressions involving the listener's most basic values. In a state positioned in America's Heartland and where, according to CNN voter exit polls, 84% of voters described themselves as moderate or conservative and 55% made under $50,000 per year; Kennedy, Clinton and Boxer are emblems of a coastal liberal elite that Thune perceives as alien to South Dakotans but that Daschle, he argues, embraces.1 In its description of these Senators, the advertisement describes their positions as variations of left tackles. The advertisement continues to use the word left, a synonym for liberal, as a condensation symbol both as a buzzword that causes its detractors to bristle and as a means to stereotype Daschle as an adherent of an ideology which the vast majority of the state rejects.

Because at the time Daschle was in a position of power in the Senate from which he could conceivably derive benefits for South Dakota and its residents, it was necessary for Thune, as is the case for many challengers, to attack Daschle retrospectively on his issue positions. Successful attacks on issue positions throughout this commercial would hopefully generate either disgust or anger on the valence scale. Candidates who try to invoke these emotions generally use economic issues as their avenue of attack and thus most of the ad's issue attacks are rooted in Daschle's failure to account for South Dakota's economic needs. According to the narrator, Daschle blocked, an energy bill that would help South Dakota farmers, a permanent tax cut for South Dakota families, and lawsuit reform that would stop frivolous lawsuits and lower medical costs. Employing the block terminology implies that Senator Daschle actively ensured that his constituents would not receive the supposed economic benefits that these pieces of legislation guaranteed. Details of the various bills of course are limited, but the outcomes, helping South Dakota farmers and families and lowering medical costs, and Daschle's obstruction of those outcomes are clear. One can conclude that John Thune, already having proven himself as a man of the people, would not be so out of touch with the desires of the people.

The only issue mentioned that is not rooted in the economy and not outcome driven, is Daschle's response to confirming judicial nominees. Here the ad once again reverts to condensation symbols associating Daschle with the buzzword filibuster, a topic of particularly hot controversy at the time. The narrator explains that when asked to confirm judicial nominees, Tom 'the blocking machine' Daschle called upon his patented move: 'the Filibuster.' If the viewer was not disgusted with Daschle already, the narrator blithely offers an epitaph: Tom 'the Blocking Machine' Daschle: crushing laws, fighting progress, stone walling hopes and dreams. Again the ad countermands positive themes, laws, progress, and hopes and dreams, with descriptions of willful obstruction on Daschle's part.

The Blocking Machine, most likely is an effort to arouse and inspire a conservative base as opposed to a wider audience of undecided voters. The ad's decidedly emotive appeal to viewers' revulsion would likely not resonate with voters who are educated on the issues and not tantalized by buzzwords, emblems and stereotypes. Furthermore, the considerably outlandish nature of the ad's production and content may very likely serve to keep voters away from the polls. The harshness of the ad's conclusion, bordering on a character assault, that Daschle stonewalls hopes and dreams, surely may have induced a different sort of revulsion among viewers. It was ads like these which, according to the South Dakota based Aberdeen American News, grated on voters like nails on chalkboards and led the paper to conclude that candidates should quit listening to the 'experts' who say negative campaigning works. 2 Yet for all of the American News's idealism, Thune's negativity proved effective as he won an incredibly close race by under 5,000 votes. Most importantly, however, while Daschle captured healthy majorities of independent and moderate voters, Thune's succeeded on the strength of overwhelming support from his base, capturing 80% of the conservative vote and 82% of the Republican vote.3 Ultimately, the election's results are emblematic of The Blocking Machine's effectiveness. To uncommitted observers its utter shamelessness likely served as a repellent. Yet emotive appeals rooted in perceptions of Daschle's obstruction of desired outcomes and political associations which embarrassed his constituents seems to have fueled in conservatives a righteous indignation to make 2004, in the words of the commercial's narrator, Tom 'the blocking machine' Daschle's farewell season.",0,0,0,0,9608
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,"Education Policy and Economic Development
A case study of Singapore and an analysis of its applicability to the United States","INTRODUCTION
The key to sustainable growth in the global economy of today rests predominantly in the contribution of knowledge towards facilitating increases in output. The value of tangible assets, for instance resources and factors of production, has diminished in relation to the growing importance that has been accorded to technological breakthroughs and advances in knowledge, both of which are consequences of increasing human capital. In particular, economically-advanced countries have been galvanized into investing in human capital by the realization that they are unable to compete with many developing nations on the basis of labor cost and capital assets alone. Legitimate and sustainable economic growth, therefore, is a product of dynamic creativity and entrepreneurship, as cogently encapsulated by Joseph Schumpeter (Schumpeter, 1934). Now, however, it is no longer adequate to merely capitalize on new ideas - rather, entrepreneurship in the globalized world is contingent upon both the discovery as well as the implementation of new ideas. The level of human capital in a particular country is directly correlated with the status accorded to education in the society, in particular the premium it places on post-secondary and tertiary education. The better-educated the workforce, the greater the positive impact on the economy (Hanushek and Kimko, 2000). Previous statistics have also shown that the link between the level of education and economic performance is not linear; rather, economic competitiveness increases exponentially as more citizens are educated to a higher level, as a greater proportion of the workforce is able to be engaged in knowledge-based sectors which yield higher capital returns.

The high economic value of education is supported by the results of both international micro and macro-economic studies. Microeconomic studies focus on the benefit of educational investments to individuals while macroeconomic studies focus on returns to the economy more generally. Microeconomic data from 42 countries found that an average rate of return for an additional year of schooling was a 9.7 per cent increase in personal income (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2002). A cross-country macroeconomic study found that there was an additional .44 per cent growth in a country's per capita GDP for each additional average year of attained schooling, a return on investment of seven per cent (Barro, 2000). Other studies have found returns that go as high as 12 per cent (Sianesi and Van Reenen, 2002; Stevens and Weale, 2003). The quality of education had an even stronger relationship to growth than did the duration of school participation; the amount learned was more important than the number of years of schooling. Higher test scores of one standard deviation equated to one per cent growth in per capita GDP (Barro, 2000).

The United States, often perceived as being at the helm of innovation, has begun to find its position as the world's dominant economic power increasingly precarious, due to a series of challenges which possess both endogenous and exogenous origins. From the international standpoint, the emergence of potential economic leviathans like China and India has reiterated the need for the U.S. to look towards developing comparative advantages in areas that are not predominantly labor-intensive, and are reliant on innovation and skills. Faced with these external challenges, the U.S. also has to figure out how to mitigate the accompanying domestic concerns that arise as a consequence, for instance the union issues precipitated by a shift away from low-skilled, labor-intensive industries. With population growth slowing, and the bulk of job creation taking place in high value-added sectors, it is essential that federal governments examine methods that increase the employability of its current citizen workforce, and enforce systems that ensure youths have the opportunities and resources to pursue higher education upon leaving high school. I seek to examine the limiting factors that have consistently prevented the U.S. from instituting a sweeping overhaul of its existing education system, and contributed to the malaise that has manifested itself in the form of persistent achievement gaps, huge disparities in the quality of education both between and within states, and unequal academic opportunities for children.

In order to answer the questions concerning education policy which have arisen in relation to the U.S.'s ability to keep pace with the demands of the new world economy, I first perform a temporal analysis on the case study of Singapore, and examine how education policy has evolved in conjunction with varying state-led initiatives. I chose Singapore because its unique path to modernization has seen it undergo several differentiated stages of economic development – first, import-substitution, followed by export-oriented industrialization, and subsequently a shift towards higher value-added, knowledge-intensive industries – within a protracted time frame. I go on to analyze how holistic education policies, for instance the variety of post-secondary institutions created to groom workers for all sectors of the workforce, were necessary to facilitate economic transformation in Singapore. I also intend to discuss the challenges faced by Singapore, for instance the issues arising from ethnic diversity and other social cleavages, and how these were successfully dealt with through the implementation of an education policy founded on the basis of meritocracy and the premise of ethnic assimilation. This can be related to the issues faced by federal governments in the U.S. in striving to ameliorate the opportunity and achievement gaps for minority populations. The fact that Singapore is a city-state allows for comparisons to be drawn both on a federal and national level in relation to the U.S. Using Terry Moe's (2003) article, The Politics of the Status Quo, an expose of the persistent failure of education reform in the U.S., as a tool, I draw inferences that explain the success of Singapore in devising and implementing education policies that have proved to be greatly beneficial to the economy, in direct contrast to the persistent failure of the U.S. in doing so. I hypothesize that Singapore's accomplishments in devising and implementing education policies that boost economic growth are largely due to conducive institutional factors. Thereafter, I hope to relate some of the lessons derived from the examination of the Singapore case study to the U.S., analyze if and how policies successfully implemented in Singapore can be duly replicated in the U.S., as well as draw some parallels between the challenges each face in their individual bid to remain economically relevant in the present day. In my paper, I first attempt to track the evolution of Singapore's economy since independence from Malaya in 1965, while simultaneously examining the ways in which the education system has changed to keep pace with continuing development.

THE CHANGING NATURE OF EDUCATION POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SINGAPORE
The time immediately following Singapore's independence was fraught with numerous obstacles, as the state struggled to ameliorate problems stemming from ethnic heterogeneity, rally the people around the common ideals of progress and harmony, and stimulate economic development in the quest towards self-sufficiency. The state thus embarked on an aggressive developmental strategy, which took into consideration limiting factors like a low-skilled workforce and scarce domestic capital. The initial two phases of Singapore's economic development strategy were thus founded on the premise of import substitution and subsequently export orientation, which saw many multi-national companies (MNCs) locate parts of their operations here to capitalize on the incentives extended by the government in a bid to attract foreign investment. With the emphasis on manufacturing and labor-intensive production, technical skills were crucial. Early on, the Singapore government recognized the importance of creating a holistic educational system which would make many educational offerings possible. However, in conjunction with the emphasis on manufacturing, a key thrust was the greater emphasis on technical education throughout the entire system (Tham, 1981). Thus, the secondary school system was restructured to include four other types of schools besides academic ones –vocational schools, technical schools, commercial schools, and vocational institutes. Within the academic school system itself, it was compulsory for all of the male and half the female students at the lower secondary levels to take technical subjects and workshop practice (Gopinathan, 1996). The MNCs also provided ample opportunities for skill training, as they partnered with the government to set up joint industrial training centers. This preoccupation with technical expertise was reflected in changes within the tertiary education sector. To accommodate the growing need for highly-skilled engineers, a faculty of engineering was created at the then-University of Singapore, and several technical colleges upgraded to diploma-awarding institutions. The government also created state institutions to provide support for the purposes of technical training. In 1979, the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) and the Council on Professional and Technical Education (CPTE) were established, which helped to provide projections for future technical need.

The emphasis on technical and technological education meant that the enrolment in the vocational institutes almost doubled, from 6,500 in 1973, to 11,500 in 1980. Growth in polytechnic enrollment was equally impressive, with almost a four-fold increase from 2,600 in 1966, to 8,300 in 1980. (Gopinathan, 1996). By the 1980s, however, changes had to be made to the existing economic agenda after over a decade of continuous economic growth ranging from 8 to 10 per cent per annum. Singapore could no longer compete on the basis of low labor costs, and thus reformulated a new economic policy that hinged far more on the production of technology-reliant, higher value-added products. Changes in science and technology education accompanied this policy shift, University engineering enrollment jumped threefold within a decade from 330 in 1976 to 1143 by 1985 (Gopinathan, 1996).

The year 1985 marked a watershed in Singapore's economic development. For two decades since independence, the country had enjoyed a continued high rate of economic growth, which averaged 8.5 per cent per annum. In 1985, Singapore experienced an economic slump, precipitated by considerable slow-down in international trade. This setback was but a temporary obstacle, however – as the Singapore economy rebounded with a growth of 2.3 per cent in 1986. Singapore went on to grow by an average of 9.2 per cent per annum for the next ten years until the Asian economic crisis, which brought growth to a halt in Singapore as well as other countries in the afflicted region (Tan, et al, 1997). An Economic Committee, established to come up with recommendations for the revival and stimulation of Singapore's economic growth, published its report in 1986. It had significant implications for the future direction of Singapore's education system. The report highlighted the necessity for each individual to be educated to his or her maximum potential, and for more emphasis to be placed on creativity and innovation within Singapore society, which would allow for skill flexibility and autonomy throughout the economy. As part of this endeavor, two milestone programs were instituted towards achieving these aims. The graduate (Masters and PhD) programs at the National University of Singapore (NUS) underwent considerable expansion, with the intake of graduate students increased by 12 per cent in 1987 as compared to the previous year. The bulk of these students were enrolled in science and engineering faculties. The overall quota of students enrolled in the tertiary institutions, undergraduate and graduate, also increased by 14 per cent over the same time period (Yip, et al, 1997). The expansion of tertiary education was accompanied by the establishment of research institutes such as the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Institute of Systems Science, the Science Faculty's (NUS) Industrial Collaboration Centre and the Engineering Faculty's (NUS) Innovation Centre (Yip, et al, 1997). This arrangement was congruent with the attempts to connect research with industrial application, and also allowed local universities the opportunity to engage in more research as opposed to solely teaching.

The direction begun in the late 1980s gained significant momentum at the turn of the century, further motivated by the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, as well as the onset of what was construed by many as the third industrial revolution. In relation to the latter, the convergence of breakthrough discoveries in six key technologies, namely microelectronics, computers, telecommunications, material science, robotics, and biotechnology, shaped the developmental priorities of states in the globalized economy by necessitating considerable investment in education and research and development (R&D) (Thurow, 1999). The currency crisis that was sparked off by the collapse of the Thai baht precipitated the East Asian economic crisis in 1997, which resulted in the second recession in Singapore's short economic history. During this period, a significant number of Singapore's traditional export markets were hard hit. These two developments created questions as to the resilience of Singapore's education system (Gopinathan, 2005). Newfound comparative advantages in the globalized economy stemmed from superior knowledge resources as well as brain power, as opposed to traditional natural resource endowments (Tan, et al, 1997). In responding to these key developments in the economy, educational policies were examined and evaluated once again. A higher premium was placed on innovation, flexibility, entrepreneurship, creativity and a commitment to lifelong learning (Gopinathan and Lee, 2005). While the role of science and technology remained important in facilitating knowledge growth, an increasing amount of attention has been devoted towards broad-based multi-disciplinary efforts in curricula. For instance, scientists and engineers are now expected to learn humanistic modes of inquiry, as there was a need for specialized professionals to not only be able think critically in their field, but also be able to communicate their ideas and allow these ideas to progress from the mind to the market.

Educationist Sinclair Goodlad (2000) argues that liberal education has a significant role to play in today's world. A fundamental feature of a liberal education is its capacity to develop in students the ability to understand issues in context. Calls have also been made in Singapore for scientists to learn from the humanities so that they are better able to communicate their ideas and discoveries in such a way as to enable others outside the immediate professional field to appreciate. In so doing, scientists would be better able to situate their work in the context of what larger society can relate to and needs. In addition, they will be better able to portray and frame their ideas and discoveries in such a way that causes these new contributions to be readily accessible and understandable by others outside their immediate professional field. A multi-disciplinary broad-based science education develops generic, transferable skills which can be applied to fields of study and careers beyond those in science and technology. The ideal student would thus be literate, numerate, IT-enabled, capable of collating, synthesizing, analyzing and applying knowledge to solve problems, are creative and innovative, entrepreneurial, and both willing and able to engage in lifelong learning (Gopinathan, 2001).

In its effort to create this new archetypal student, the Ministry of Education once again embarked on a holistic set of changes across the education system. To foster greater creativity and innovation in students, the Thinking Schools, Learning Nation (TSLN) initiative was launched in 1997, and focused on developing students into active learners with critical thinking skills, while developing a creative and critical thinking culture within schools. It was a strong restatement of the need to develop the individual in an academically-diverse manner, without losing sight of the pragmatic ideology that had hitherto underscored educational policy, which would enable him or her to readily acclimatize to the dynamism of the global economy. In tertiary institutions, the generation of knowledge has been given more attention, together with an emphasis on the linkage between research and its economic impact. Cross-faculty breadth and general education requirements have been made compulsory, exposing undergraduates to disciplines beyond their field of specialization. Graduate research programs have further expanded and new research institutes have been established. The best and brightest students are encouraged to enroll in multidisciplinary programs that span diverse fields within and across subjects, such as biomedical engineering. In support of this endeavor, NUS has set up a Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, a flagship program which has attracted some of the best graduate students in the region. The quality of some of these educational and research programs is enhanced through collaboration and exchange with world-renowned universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Accompanying the growing emphasis on graduate (in particular, PhD) programs, another key prong in the reshaping of the university landscape aims to position universities in such a way that they are able to make a greater contribution to the economic sphere of Singapore. To do so, the link between research in universities and their economic impact has to be enhanced (Gopinathan and Lee, 2005). Singapore has elected to take its cue from the success of countries like the U.S. in invoking technology transfer and seamlessly integrating research institutions as an integral part of economic achievement. For instance, MIT and Stanford University have been held up as examples of how universities can become the driving forces behind rapid economic growth. In such institutions, faculty members can be easily approached by industry for ideas and consultation, and professors are not restricted to academic responsibilities. University-industry links are also encouraged through the many research institutes that have been established through funding provided by the Agency for Science and Technology (A*STAR), a statutory board designed for the purposes of promoting R&D in its eponymous fields. These research institutes have cultivated extensive links with overseas research institutions as well as with both local and foreign companies. Universities have also been exhorted to strengthen their linkage with industry, and encouraged to play an active role in cultivating the entrepreneurial spirit of both faculty and students. In response, universities have developed incubation centres for entrepreneurship and research efforts, as well as other institutional mechanisms which provide the means and support for prototypes to be created, or for promising discoveries to be introduced to the market. At NUS, technopreneurship courses are offered to students, and interested students can apply for academic credit-earning internships with startups in key technology nodes such as Silicon Valley. Such internships are arranged with a view in mind to enable students with a gift in science and technology to marry their interests with their entrepreneurial appetite.

Most recently, in May 2003, the Report of the Committee to Review the University Sector and Graduate Manpower Planning was jointly published by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Manpower. This report was instrumental in providing recommendations to the two main research universities in Singapore. First, it envisaged that NUS would be transformed into a multi-campus university system with two niche institutions, in addition to the existing campus at Kent Ridge (Ministry of Education, 2007). The first new niche institution would be a research-intensive university focusing on engineering, science and info-communications technology, while the other would be a specialized institution providing medical and health science education. Furthermore, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the second most established university in Singapore, would be developed into a full-fledged comprehensive university, shifting away from its current focus on professional and technological degrees. The report recommended that NTU add a School of Physical Sciences to its campus in order to complement the existing School of Biological Sciences, so as to allow the integration of knowledge and skills from the physical sciences and engineering with the biological sciences. This science and technology cluster would prove instrumental in supporting Singapore's aim of building up the life sciences industry. NTU was also exhorted to build its business cluster to support the science and technology cluster to arm graduates with both hard technical knowledge and softer business and management skills to be versatile and entrepreneurial in the workplace. In addition to these recommendations, it was also proposed that NTU set up a new Humanities cluster, as well as a new School of Design & Media to complement the existing School of Communications and Information. Design arts and media modules would also conceivably be able to support the design aspect of IT and engineering R&D work in NTU (Ministry of Education, 2007).

The Report also provided general, less institutional-specific recommendations. It recommended that undergraduate output numbers be set in terms of broader categories across clusters of disciplines, rather than faculty-specific levels. This would enable and support the creation of hybrid courses to better meet industry's needs and students' aspirations, in line with the goal of encouraging multidisciplinary learning. Finally, it also recommended the maintenance of a deliberate bias towards science and technology courses, so that 50 to 60 per cent of the total university cohort each year would graduate from these courses. The report indicated that this was to ensure that as global competition for technical manpower intensified, Singapore would be able to produce adequate levels of local technological and technical manpower to support national requirements to sustain economic growth and development (Ministry of Education, 2007).

In Singapore, the abiding emphasis on science and technology education continues for pragmatic reasons, even though this is now mediated by the increasing influence of the humanities, justified via a philosophy of broad-based, multidisciplinary education. Consequently, while still remaining true to its utilitarian approach to education, Singapore is moving towards achieving a better equilibrium between developing an individual holistically and the country's need to stay economically competitive.",0,0,50.99,39.59,23492
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,The Jewish Vote: An Investigation of the Proposed Rise in 'Chosen' Republicans,"Introduction
Although the United States has constitutional barriers separating the church from stat affairs, religion has a significant impact on politics. Politicians regularly discuss their religion while campaigning, and not only are a candidate's religious beliefs of great concern to voters, but one's own religious beliefs and cultural traditions have a significant impact on a citizen's voting behavior. The Jewish vote, in particular, is a vital and influential component in the United States political landscape. Although Jews in the United States only constitute a marginal group in society, they have the potential to have a great impact on the electoral process. They have a very particular voting behavior and receive much attention from politicians. Jews are overactive politically and are attributed with having the highest percentage voter-turnout rate of any ethnic group. In addition, they are the wealthiest religious group, and have a high potential to financially influence political candidates and campaigns. Jews are actively engaged in politics as activists and advocates, as well as in policy development. They are a sought-after political commodity, and have a great potential to sway elections. Historically, one key political characteristic of the Jewish community in the United States has been a close identification with the Democratic Party. However, a recent contention has arisen that Jews have begun to progressively associate more with the Republican Party. Though multiple political organizations have emerged with the purpose of lobbying for this alleged expanding group of Republican Jews, there is much debate over this proposed alteration in Jewish political identification. As Jewish Americans obtain ever more attention from elected officials and potential to sway the electorate, it becomes increasingly significant to examine party identification of Jews in the United States, as well as whether this alleged emerging Jewish Republican is in fact a reality. The objective of this paper is to determine the validity of this proposed increase in Jewish identification with the Republican Party.

Background: Jews in United States Politics
In order to absorb the magnitude of the implication that there has been an increase in Jewish-Republican identification, one must first understand several details regarding how American Jews fit into the United States political arena. American politics in general is comparatively peculiar. Although the United States adheres to the principle of separation between church and state, it is a highly religious country. Ninety percent of the population claims they are adherents to a particular religion, and nearly ninety-five percent believe in god (Central Intelligence Agency). In addition, religious fanaticism is quite common in the United States. Although there is no official religion, religion is an extremely important component within politics. It seems recently, religion has been woven more firmly into the fabric of United States partisan politics than ever before. Religious institutions have been instrumental in campaigning for their followers to vote for a particular candidate, and it is very common for people to look to their places of worship to answer many social and political questions. Furthermore, whether one regularly attends religious services has become more important in determining how one votes for president than past standard demographic characteristics including gender, age, income and region.

Even within the peculiar political climate of the United States, Jews are an anomaly in themselves. Although they only account for about 2.3 percent of the population, they are disproportionally represented in American politics. One key reason that Jews have become so important in the electoral process is due to where they live geographically. Roughly 60 percent of Jews in the United States live in metropolitan areas, and roughly 94 percent live in 13 key electoral college states (Bard). Not only are these thirteen states alone worth enough electoral votes to elect the president of the United States, they are key swing states that politicians pander to for votes. Coupled with the critical geographic location of Jewish populations, the obvious power and importance of the Jewish vote is vividly seen when one considers the politically overactive and participative behavior that characterizes the Jewish community. Jews have the highest percentage voter-turnout rate of any ethnic group. As highly active citizens who regularly register and vote in high numbers, they are a key demographic group targeted by politicians. In addition, Jews are one of the wealthiest religious groups. Their potential to contribute financially and influence political candidates and campaigns are extraordinary. Collectively, these features cause the Jews to be considered one of the most influential religious groups in American politics.

Concurrent with this hyperactive political nature, Jews have also been characterized as historically liberal and voting Democrat. There has been extensive hypotheses and investigations concerning why Jews generally identify as liberal. Many theorists suggest principles of social justice found in religious and messianic principles that resonate and influence the Jewish political agenda. In identifying as liberal, Jews break with the political tendency for groups to vote based on economic interests. As Milton Himmelfarb encapsulated so eloquently, Jews earn like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans. This summarizes the central paradox of Jewish politics in the United States. As the wealthiest ethnic group, Jews should identify as Republicans, as they support a pro-business platform as well as economic libertarianism, and emphasize individual control of ones economic lives without state intervention. Generally, the more economically successful a group is, the more likely they will demonstrate conservative attitudes and voting behaviors, whereas the lower the socioeconomic class of a group, the more likely liberal behavior will manifest. Jews as a demographic group do not follow this trend. However, one exception to the tendency for Jewish Americans to identify as liberal is Orthodox Jews. The values of Orthodox Jewry are very different from regular Jewish Americans. They are more conservative, and in many ways align more closely with Republicans on issues such as parochial schools and abortion. Although Orthodox Jews only account for less than 10 percent of the population, they are reproducing faster than the general Jewish population, due to trends against assimilation and modernization, and thus could prove to be an important political force in the future.

Documented exit poll analysis reveals that Jewish support for both Democratic congressional candidates as well as Democratic presidential candidates has fluctuated greatly since 1968, however usually ranges between 60 to 80 percent support (Maisel 171). As a general demographic group, they support abortion rights, gay rights, separation between church and state, and are very sympathetic to the economically disadvantaged. In certain cases, Jews are stubbornly Democratic, and do not mind voting for a candidate that is clearly unpopular. For example, in 1944 although a majority of Americans began to lose faith in the New Deal policies of President Roosevelt, 90 percent of Jews remained loyal to the President (Kamp). In addition, Jews hold a special role in the 1972 election where George McGovern lost to Richard Nixon in the second greatest landslide in American history. Although McGovern suffered from support of merely 38 percent of American public, he received 65 percent of the Jewish vote (Kamp).

The historic liberal association by American Jewry continues to be a mysterious, yet undeniable inconsistency for many scholars, as it holds for every level of income, education, and class. In the most recent 2006 Election, Jewish support for Democrat candidates for the House of Representative surged to 87 percent (CNN). Following the 2006 election, 13 out of the 100 Senate members were Jews and 30 out of the 435 member House of Representatives were Jewish. Out of these Jewish politicians, two of the 13 Jewish Senate members are Republicans, whereas only one of the 30 House members is. Nevertheless, clearly today almost more than ever Jews hold significant political power.

The fact that Jews live in key swing-states and vote in very high numbers have many critical political implications. Although historically they have consistently voted for democratic candidates, there has been much discussion in recent years that Jews are beginning to associate more with Republicans. There are various rational for this alleged shift, including an increase in nested identity and consequent rejection of Jewish culture and identification. In addition, there has been a recent emerging trend for Republicans be more supportive of Israel. The prospect that Jews could be leaning more Republican could have monumental political consequences. They are a politically powerful group, heavily involved and contributory. If captivated by a particular candidate, the Jewish community has the potential to tip the balance and swing elections.

Methods
The objective of this paper was to determine whether there has been an increase in conservative political identification among American Jewry. In order to investigate this question, it became necessary to examine various types of sources. It first became fundamental to examine Jewish political behavior. Therefore, I consulted diverse texts in order to become more aware of specific Jewish voting behavior. It was necessary to understand how Jews as a group vote, and recognize particular criteria they use in determining their chosen candidate in order to recognize a shift in voting patterns. I also consulted Jewish political organizations, newspapers, and other institutions in order to become more conscious of recent American Jewish political thought. I examined several new Jewish Republican organizations, evaluating their claims that membership is on the rise.

Additionally, it became necessary to examine various gallop polls and exit polls from elections that accounted for Jewish votes. One notes the challenge in obtaining a thorough portrayal of the political attitudes and characteristics of the Jewish population in America. As Jews are only about 2 percent of the population, a random sample of 1,000 individuals only produces about 20 Jewish respondents, which is not sufficient to analyze a particular group, let alone come to a comprehensive conclusion. It was necessary to employ polls with larger Jewish sample sizes from a range of populations in order to produce adequate Jewish responses necessary to create meaningful examination regarding various political and religious questions.

As one may note, mostly data from presidential and congressional elections is used as evidence in this report. Polls corresponding to these national elections are the most widely available data that persistently accounts for Jewish votes. As presidential elections are generally seen as the most important politically, they are the most financially infused and heavily covered journalistically, and many of these polls can be counted on as reliable depending on their source and how the poll was conducted. In addition, it is noted that many citizens vote differently dependent on national or local elections. However, in a paper of this length it was chosen to examine mostly the more dominant congressional and presidential data. In addition, it was attempted to include polls where the specific survey's methodology was most flawless.

What one finds is evidence that suggests higher disillusionment with the Democratic Party and a higher inclination for Jews to vote based more on the particular issues or candidate rather than his or her party. There is indication that more Jews are making political decisions less rooted on factors associated with being Jewish, such as the State of Israel. However, one finds these Jews still maintain a mostly liberal outlook. In general, Jews base their decisions heavily on the specific candidate and his particular platform. One of the reasons for the popularity and widespread consciousness of a possible increase in Jewish Republicans is the emergence of various Jewish conservatives and Republican organizations being established in the past twenty years. These organizations work fervently advocating and campaigning to Jewish interests, and have advertised stridently, although mostly falsely, that there has been a shift in Jewish ideology. The matter is further complicated by the recent phenomenon for Republicans to appear more visibly against terrorism and in support of a strong defense of Israel. Therefore, more religious Jews who fervently support Israel may be more inclined to vote for particular Republicans who, among other issues that match up, proclaim strong support of Israel. In addition, Evangelical Christians, whom many Jews believe to be deeply anti-Semitic, have been historically linked with the Republican Party. Although this stigma has been wavering in recent years, it still holds some Jews with apprehension. Nevertheless, it remains yet to be shown whether the outspoken declaration by these Jewish Republican groups is in fact true.

Overview: Shifts in Population Trends and Political Behavior
There are several recent trends in Jewish political behavior of which the ramifications could account for a shift in Jewish identification towards conservatism. Jewish Americans are becoming more assimilated in society than ever. According to a the National Jewish Population Survey of 2000-01 conducted by the United Jewish Communities, intermarriage occurs in roughly half of the population and only one third of children raised by intermarried couples are raising their children with a Jewish religious upbringing (United Jewish Communities 16). Furthermore, the Population Survey reports, At all ages, fertility among Jewish women is lower than fertility for all U.S. women, whether gauged by the percent who are childless or the average number of children ever born (United Jewish Committee 14). Accordingly, the American Jewish population has shrunken 5 percent, from 5.5 million in 1990 to 5.2 million in 2000-01, due to the falling birthrate and popularity of intermarriage (13). In the survey, a Jew was defined as a person whose religion is Jewish, or whose religion is Jewish and something else, or who has no religion and has at least one Jewish parent or a Jewish upbringing, or who has a non-monotheistic religion, and has at least one Jewish parent or a Jewish upbringing (13). However, there has been a rise in nested identity among American Jewry. As Jews are becoming more assimilated into general society, less emphasis is placed on being Jewish, and their cultural identity becomes less influential on their belief system. As more Jews are becoming more culturally assimilated, being Jewish becomes a less crucial influence on their political behavior.

In recent years, there has also been evidence of a shift in Party support of Israel that may have implications on how the American Jewry votes. There has been much concern of left wing, anti-Israel sentiment pervading the Democratic Party. In addition, since the terrorist attacks on September 11th, the Republican Party has maintained strong stance on defense and the Middle East. Many Republican candidates have been outspoken in their support for Israel. In addition, with the recent development of Iran's nuclear program, there have been high levels of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel expression around the globe. These issues could have great implications regarding Jewish political consciousness and even voting behavior.

Jewish Republican Visibility
Although the reports that American Jewry are becoming more Republican in identification have not yet been founded, there has been a noble emergence of various Jewish organizations created to advocate for Jewish Republican interests. One of the most influential of these recent groups has been the Republican Jewish Coalition, which was founded in 1985. It is the self-proclaimed most important voice on Republican issues in the Jewish Community, and has more than 35 chapters throughout the United States (Republican Jewish Coalition). These organizations claim that the time is appropriate for Jewish Americans to make a shift in party support. Many make the claim, as does Alan J. Stwinberg, that The political conservatism of American society today fully coincides with the Jewish values of justice, fairness, respect for the dignity of man, and the punishment of those forces of evil who would seek to destroy us (Maisel 278). Although these groups are potent lobbyers for the interests of Jewish conservatives, they are also committed to increasing visibility of Jewish Republicans, and campaigning against Democratic candidates they claim to have weak positions on Israel. Many groups have been very successful at making their voices heard, through vigorous ad campaigns, many of which challenge Democratic candidates on their loyalty to Jewish concerns and their support of Israel. These ads primarily spotlight anti-Israel remarks made by well-known Democrats. The Executive Director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Matt Brooks, encapsulates his group's intention when he states, The party of Harry Truman and Scoop Jackson has become the party of Jimmy Carter, Al Sharpton, and Cindy Sheehan. Jewish Democrats should take a fresh look and see if they are still comfortable with the growing influence of the anti-Israel radical Left within the Democratic Party (Ryce).

In addition, since the 1950s there has been evidence of a budding neoconservative movement among Americans Jews, who were slowly moving to the Republican Party. Primarily composed of Jewish intellections, they believed the Democrats were no longer worthy of their support due to their neglect of Israel as well as the overall American-Jewish community. They encouraged a more independent stance towards party identification, and ardently endorsed several Republican presidential candidates. Nevertheless, they have attracted a very limited amount of followers to their movement.

The Reported Increase in Jewish Republicans
Several Jewish Republican groups have emerged in the past two decades, and declared, as did the Republican Jewish Coalition, that The last decade has seen tremendous growth in the number of Jews identifying with Republican ideas and the GOP (Republican Jewish Coalition). However, there is much evidence that proves Jewish party identification has remained quite stable. This is exposed by examining Gallup Poll analysis of party identification within religious groups between the years 1992-2001 and 2001-2002. The Gallup Poll found almost exactly the same distribution of party identification among the Jewish population as is the case in the most recent year and a half: 50% Democrat, 32% independent, 18% Republican (Gallup Poll). As noted, In recent national presidential races, Jews have given at least two-thirds of their vote to the Democratic nominee, despite the tremendous amount of contemporary discussion about Jewish disaffection from the Democratic party (Fowler 71). Furthermore, since the development of these organizations in 1985, not only has the Jewish vote for Republican candidates in presidential elections remained within normal ranges, it reached its lowest point in nearly fifty years. During the 1992 election of President George Bush, only 11 percent of American Jewry supported the president's reelection, which was greatly declined from the 35 percent of the Jewish vote he received four years previously in 1988.

Many of these groups have claimed success regarding not only increased group membership but also visible increase in the amount of Jewish Americans voting Republican. A common trend for these types of groups seems to be to manipulate data in order to use as support for their desired argument. As stated on the Republican Jewish Coalition's website: The Republican Party is making inroads in the historically-Democratic Jewish community. In the last four presidential elections, the Jewish vote for the Republican candidate went from 11 percent in 1992, to 16 percent in 1996, to 19 percent in 2000, and to 25 percent in 2004 (Republican Jewish Coalition). This quote, posted on the Newsroom section of their website, does not mention the 24 percent drop in the Jewish vote between the first and second election terms of George Herbert-Walker Bush's Presidency. In addition, in the five previous elections of years 1972 through 1988, the Jewish vote for Republican candidates remained above 27 percent, reaching a high of 39 percent in 1980. Thus, although there has been a stable increase in the number of Jews voting Republican in the past two decades, it is important to note that it followed substantial decline. Since the conception of the Republican Jewish Coalition in 1985, they first witnessed a huge decrease in Jews voting for Republican Candidates, its lowest support in nearly fifty years, only to then observe a steady increase each year following this nadir.

Israel and Assimilation
One of the most interesting questions throughout the seemingly inconsistencies that characterize Jewish voting behavior is the importance of a particular candidates view towards Israel. Many political analysts predicted a great increase in Jews identifying as Republicans due to the appearance of many Republicans having stronger support for Israel than their Democratic counterparts do, however party identification has not yet shifted in the ways they forecasted. As already discovered, the younger generation of Jews has an evident feeling of detachment towards Israel. In addition, according to a poll conducted by the Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for the National Jewish Democratic Council, only one of the seven Jews who step into a voting booth for the presidential election will the candidate's attitude towards Israel prove crucial (Sofer). Experts postulate that the longer the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians drags on, the more the war is seen as a conflict whose participants basically refuse to make peace. Israel is simply not placed as high of a priority in Jewish voting behavior as once believed, both due to rising uneasiness towards the Israeli controversy, as well as the emotional detachment of younger Jews. However, many non-Jewish Americans also seem to care deeply about Israel. Although Orthodox Jews are more likely to be fervent supporters of Israel than secular or Reform Jews, Orthodox Jews are also more likely to be Republican. In addition, Evangelical Christians, who virtually unconditionally vote Republican, are also very likely to be pro-Israel. Support for Israel appears to be highly correlated with being more committed religiously. Much of the criticism towards Jews who still vote Democrat is instigated by the fact that many Republicans appear to have stronger convictions in Israel than their Democratic counterparts. However, Israel is simply not a crucial factor in the voting booth for a majority of Jews. This multilayered and interconnected evidence points to an understandable source for the discrepancy between the Republican organizations and conservative voices that continue to predict a shift in the Jewish vote away from the previous Democratic identification and the fact that a clear repositioning has not yet been noticed.

Nevertheless, the consequences of this politicizing support of Israel have not yet become apparent. Historically, Israel has been a bipartisan issue. In the past, Presidents from both parties have worked tirelessly in support of the state of Israel and its efforts to forge peace. This has built a healthy relationship between the United States and Israel, and given confidence that the United States would be untiringly committed to the security of Israel and anti-terrorist efforts. However, as Jewish Republican organizations slandering Democratic candidates with allegations of being hostile towards Israel, the negative long-term affect on the vital relationship between the United States and Israel could be disastrous.

Many consider President George W. Bush to be a major factor in the recovery of Jewish voters after the substantial plunge in the 1990s. President Bush garnered a 5 percent increase in the Jewish vote between his first and second election, receiving 19 percent of the Jewish vote in 2000 to 24 percent in 2004 (Maisel 153). His campaign focused heavily on foreign policy, which centered heavily on his strong foreign policies regarding terrorism and homeland security. Many Jews began to take a second look at the President's strong position against terrorism and support of Israel's defense efforts. Whereas the overall coverage of the Middle East by the news media as well as many Democrats came out critically towards Israel, President Bush emerged as exceptionally supportive of Israel's needs. Many Jews found themselves supportive of the president's strong backing of Israel and his overall management of the war on terror. In addition, his strong reaction of declaring war on terrorism following the September 11th attacks also drew support among many Jews who were particularly devoted to Israel. It remains yet to be seen whether the next Republican presidential candidate can convey a similarly strong message to the Jewish community, and garner comparable electorate.

The evolving composition of the Jewish community in the United States also plays a heavy role in Jewish voting behavior. Jews are becoming increasingly assimilated within society, intermarrying and becoming ever-more secular. There are an increasing amount of ethnic Jews, who even though are culturally assimilated within society, share a Jewish parentage and background. Although they may not actively practice Judaism, they still identity with Jewish causes, culturally and fraternally. Their voting behavior, although ultimately reflecting this attachment vibrantly, may not be perfectly consistent with other religious Jews. In addition, granted they may retain liberal platform regarding issues such as homosexuality, abortion, and stem cell research, their affinity towards Israel is not as strong as Jews that are more religious. This development had a major influence on why many Jews do not automatically support Republican candidates who are more pro-Israel than their Democratic competitors are.

Several characteristics of the younger Jewish generation may help to enlighten the understanding of Jewish voting behavior. Ann Greenberg and Kenneth D. Wald point out the lack of a deep partisanship among young Jews, who are more prone to labeling themselves as independents. They claim that only 10 percent of Jews under thirty-five years old call themselves Republican, while 42 percent call themselves politically Independent, and 49 percent identify as Democrat (Maisel 175). This poll observes a rather sturdy jump in the number of responders labeling themselves Independent. However, according to this statistic, although young Jews may be less devoted to the Democratic Party than their elders may, they are not shifting Republican Party. There are many causational factors for this decrease in partisanship. First, younger people are generally less politically active and engaged than older generations. In addition, according to the National Jewish Population Survey of 2000-01, intermarriage has become increasingly more common among the younger generation of Jews. The study also claims that younger adults also report less frequent endorsement of two critical attitudes related to Jewish ethnicity, the importance of being Jewish and feeling emotionally attached to Israel (21). This detached connection with Israel has many implications regarding the Jewish vote. Many Republican groups rely heavily on a strong support of Israel and combative attitude towards terrorism in order to attract the Jewish vote, however their strategy may be lost on this emerging group of young, culturally and socially assimilated Jews.

There are many prominent Jewish figures attempting to examine the phenomenon of Jewish assimilation, particularly in the context of its political implications regarding the Jewish vote. One interesting observation has been the increasing disaffection with the party system in general, not only by Jewish voters, but also by American citizens in general. In response to several negative characteristics of modern American political, many Jewish Americans, as well as Americans in general, have begun to claim themselves to be Independent, and many have begun to reject the two-party system. In a sermon addressed to the Jewish community, Rabbi Samuel M. Stahl addresses the plummeting voting rates and political apathy pervading the community, and makes a desperate plea to the younger generation to become politically actively and involved in government. Above all, he notes assimilation has taken its toll. Many American Jews today are far removed from the world of the pogroms and the poverty that our grandparents and great-grandparents finally escaped after leaving Eastern Europe. Our young Jewish citizens have only known freedom and take it for granted (Stahl). However, not simply internal factors within the Jewish community affect the way in which citizens vote. Modern politics is plagued by slanderous and scandalous behavior by public officials, and evidence of increasing indifference of voters has been eminent. The numerous scandals, partisan squabbling, and defamatory campaigns seem to take up the majority of a politician's time. In addition, voters feel increasingly powerlessness concerning the impact of their individual vote. In the United States, approximately only half of those eligible to vote in elections do so. Each of these facts, coupled with the escalating climate of fear and spiritual malaise that has recently begun to characterize the American political landscape, fuels this growing voter apathy. It remains yet to be seen whether this younger Jewish generation will emerge from the masses as a solid voice for Jewish concerns or simply another assimilated group, lost in the crowed.

The Jewish Vote as a Complex and Fluid Entity
Although there are many conditions that seem to hint at prospects for political repositioning among Jewish voters, there is as of yet very little evidence of a party shift. As David M. Shribman proposes in Hosts, Not Visitors: The Future of Jews in American Politics: The appearance, for example, of a compelling national republican figure with special appeal to Jews might help sever Jews from their traditional ties. Under a model of political behavior where the elites move first, the underpinnings of such a realignment certainly are present (Maisel 279). He notes that the Jewish vote is tied closely with the tensions and pressures of the time (Maisel 279). Overall, the Jewish vote is mobilized primarily by the specific issues of the election. Jews as voters are a much more complex political electorate than many pundits give them credit. They are not single-issue voters, and although support for Israel may be a very important factor, it does not appear to be the pinnacle issue that will sway the electorate. As Ira Forman, an executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, notes Religious freedom, reproductive rights, stem cell research, global warming, the teaching of Intelligent Design and providing for those most in need are the types of issues that drive Jewish voters. On all these issues, clear differences exist between the two parties, and the Democratic positions are the choice of nearly all American Jews (Forman). Nevertheless, obviously, Jewish Americans are not a homogeneous group, and each distinct citizen bases his or her vote on varied qualities and factors. Moreover, it has been observed that more centralist Republicans have been able to attract a significant amount of Jewish voters. Since 1916, the percentage of Jewish voters deciding to vote for Republican candidates has varied substantially between a high of 45 percent and a low of 10 percent (Maisel 153). Many Jewish moderates are promising voters for Republicans as they could easily shift due to the precise mix of various issues, including Israel, terrorism, the economy, and other republican platforms. Although in recent years there has been a gradual increase in the percent of Jewish citizens voting for Republican candidates, it has been nearly double at other points in history. The Jewish vote depends on a variety of characteristics, including key important domestic and international issues as well as the individual candidate, both of which are features that continue to drive Jewish voting behavior. Ultimately, though, each individual citizen makes the decision alone in that voting booth on who he or she believes is the best man or woman for the job.

Suggestion of the formation of several Jewish Republican groups in the past several decades does not necessarily communicate as an overarching trend pervading the Jewish community for Jews to identify as Republicans. As of yet, Jews have not yet overcome their traditional political orientation. Although evidence does hint at a less party-oriented electorate than exemplified by past American Jewry, Jews remain quite loyal to their Democratic tradition. Nevertheless, although there are Jews who seek to dramatically challenge this Democratic practice, it seems this is heavily based on a multifaceted set of criteria based on the particular election cycle. Depending on the particular political environment, issues, and candidate, Jews may be more responsive to a Republican candidate. However, as of yet, a majority of American Jewry have not gone astray from their Democratic roots.

It seems repeatedly, though confronted with many voices fervently declaring the opposite, most of the evidence clearly points to an obvious consistency of Jewish constituency voting for Democratic candidates. According to a Gallop Poll from May 2004, which went as far as to ask independents if they were inclined towards one major political party, Taken together, more than two in three Jews, 68 percent, either identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party. 28 percent of Jews are either Republican or lean Republican, and 4 percent are independents with no partisan leanings (Jewish Virtual Library). This poll proves quite enlightening regarding Independent voters. As already discussed, there has been suggestion of Jewish Americans, following the trend of greater America, to take a more independent political stance. This poll shows that even those Jews who initially identify as Independents eventually when prompted to make a decision between one or the other, as one essentially is pressed to on the ballot, chooses Democratic.

Examination of the 2006 Annual Survey of American Jewish Opinion reveals similar enlightenment. The American Jewish Committee, an organization that claims to rally for all sections of American Jewry, conducted this poll through nearly 1,000 mail respondents. In response to the question In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent? 15 percent responded as Republican, 54 percent as Democrat, 29 percent as Independent, and 3 percent were unsure (American Jewish Committee 5). This is quite consistent with the established range of Jewish vote of presidential elections for the past fifty years, which shows Democratic presidential candidates earning approximately between sixty and eighty percent of Jewish support. Throughout the 1990s, nearly 60 percent of Jews identified with Democrats, which remains an evident consistency with the Jewish electorate of today (Maisel 172). The findings of the American Jewish Committee in 2006, which claimed that 54 percent of respondents self-identified as Democrat, prove considerably consistent with the suggested range during the 1990s. Yet again, even the Jewish vote is dominated by a Democratic inclination, despite the allegations of Jewish Republicans and their organizations.

The 2006 Election
The most recent 2006 election is an exemplary episode of both the evident overwhelmingly Democratic inclination of the Jewish vote, as well as the ways in which particular Republican Jewish institutions select specific statistics in order to manipulate data to demonstrate the opposite. As was briefly discussed in the introduction, Jews surfaced overwhelmingly in favor of Democratic candidates, with 87 percent of Jewish voters reportedly voting for Democrats (CNN). This accounts for the highest percentage Jewish voter support of Democrats since 1994, when Republicans took control of Congress. Although there are obviously a multitude of reasons for this increased, a disillusionment of President Bush and the handling of the war in Iraq by the Republican-controlled Congress, as well as the President, clearly had an impact on the Jewish vote. This asymmetrical response is in general fairly consistent with the most recent analysis by the independent American Jewish Committee's 2006 Annual Survey of American Jewish Opinion, which showed a breakdown of 15 percent identifying as Republican, 54 percent as Democrats, 29 percent as Independent, and the rest as uncertain (American Jewish Committee 5). If a shift to the Republican Party for Jewish-Americans is eminent, as many Jewish Republican organizations proclaim, it seems it has yet to have occurred. Moreover, the circumstances of the 2006 election show the intricacy and fluidity of the Jewish vote, which has been seen to shift depending on the moment's state of affairs and candidate positions in response to those conditions.

Although statistical evidence points to a clear Democratic victory regarding the Jewish vote, several Jewish Republican organizations claimed that the Jewish vote remained stable in the 2006 election. Many groups, however, used flawed methodology as basis for asserting that Jewish support for Republican candidates remained firm in 2006. One example of this case of flawed methodology includes a poll done by the Republican Jewish Coalition to contest the proposed Democratic surge. It relied on telephone responses from only three distinct districts (Fingerhut). A poll conducted through a telephone-response technique is much less reliable than exit polls, which are done at polling places immediately as voters leave the building. A second procedural flaw is that the responders of the Republican Jewish Coalition survey were selected from commercially available Jewish voter lists, and not selected randomly, which is usually considered the best way to achieve an accurate depiction of the community. Instead, the survey consulted a list of names identified as being Jewish. The survey also only considered those who identified as Orthodox, Conservative or Reform Jews. It did not consult the growing number of individuals who, through intermarriage, assimilation, or a variety of other reasons may not practice Judaism in its religious construction, however may still consider themselves Jewish culturally and ethnically. There are many Jews who partake in select Jewish holidays or other forms of cultural involvement, though they may not consider themselves religiously Jewish. These secular Jews may still regard being Jewish as extremely important, as well as a central factor in their specific voting behavior. In addition, as previously discussed, there is an overwhelmingly evident trend for more religious individuals to be more likely to identify as conservative and Republican. It appears this sample consciously overlooks a substantial portion of the Jewish community, and specifically a portion of the community that may identify as tremendously Democratic. In fact, in this survey by the Republican Jewish Coalition, 17 percent of responders were classified as Orthodox, a group that is generally regarded as more typically politically conservative than other Jewish denominations as well as the Jewish community in general. This evidence is suspect because in reality approximately less than 10 percent of the Jewish population in the United States is classified as Orthodox. Nevertheless, this survey errors dramatically in that it greatly oversamples a generally more conservative population and omits a section that is typically more politically liberal in its attempt to prove that the community as a whole has become more conservative.

Many different organizations with divergent purposes meticulously select specific polls and surveys in order to support their claims, and it is important to be observant to the methodology and partiality of the particular census. Although numerous Jewish Republican organizations have made the claim that there has been an increase of Republican Party identification among American Jewry in recent years, this has yet to be proven. Moreover, this example from the 2006 election was not intended as slanderous exercise towards any organization. It was meant merely as an illustration not only of the flawed support used to uphold the conviction that more Jews are becoming Republican, as well as to demonstrate why this particular rumor has become widespread. In fact, according to the majority of the evidence, Jewish Americans vote as frequently for Democratic candidates as they did previously.

Conclusion
Although Jewish Americans have similar voting behavior and political concerns, they are heterogeneous body whose voting patterns have fluctuated overtime depending on a multitude of situational factors. Generally the Jewish vote can be characterized as overwhelmingly Democratic, depending on the time and its circumstances, however many Jewish American have previously supported Republican candidates. Jews as a whole share a very similar belief system, however obviously are a diverse group of people with diverse interests and concerns. Therefore, throughout history, Jewish voting patterns have fluctuated dramatically depending on the candidate and the circumstances of that era. Nevertheless, Republicans have boasted that in recent years, more and more Jewish Americans, who have historically given electoral support to Democratic candidates, are increasingly supporting Republicans, both financially as well as in the voting booth. However, despite the recent allegations proposing that more Jews in the United States have begun to shift political party identification from Democrat to Republican, evidence demonstrates that this is not the case. There are various interconnected elements contributing to the rise of this view that in all reality is a misconception. Overall, Jewish voting behavior is tremendously more complex than political analysts theorized. Jews base their vote on a variety of issues. They are heavily involved in politics, actively and financially supporting campaigns and candidates, and possess extremely high voter turnout rates. Therefore, obviously Jews regard politics as considerably significant and have particular political concerns they naturally hold as significant. However, although Jews as a group are characterized by this natural emphasis on political participation, as individuals they have particular concerns and considerations.

The main fault in political analyst's predictions that the Jewish vote would begin to lean more Republican as Republican politicians began to support Israel more fervently lies in the fact that Jewish voters are not single-issue voters. Many Republican Jewish organizations campaigned deliberately shadowing Democrats as less supportive of Israel than Republicans. The big hope for Republican analysts was that a strong stance on Israel would sway Jewish voters, which did not work out as the hierarchy had hoped. Moreover, if the proposed increase in Jewish Republican identification is valid, it would logically follow that more Jewish Republicans would be elected in office, especially with the prevailing lobby power of Jewish Republican organizations. However, only three of the 43 Jews elected in the House of Representatives and Congress are Republicans. This is less than 10 percent of the total Jews elected for Congressional offices.

In all, Jews remain an anomaly within the United States political system. As a group, they are remarkably wealthy and yet vote in the interests of the poor. Although some evidence shows that Jews have become more politically Independent in thinking, when pressured to vote in the ballot box they still overwhelmingly lean Democratic. However, while evidence proves that a majority of Jews are Democrats, each view is found somewhere within the vast labyrinth of Jewish tradition and philosophy. Judaism does not necessarily dictate that one be Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, capitalist or socialist. However, in the United States, the Judaic tradition, culture, and background has manifested in a strong inclination towards liberal and Democratic political concerns.

The intent of this paper was to explore and examine the relationship between Judaism and the political preferences of Jewish Americans in order to determine whether the rumored increase in Jewish Republicans is a valid assertion. An assortment of evidence was shown to demonstrate that this allegation is premature in its assertion, and that current evidence establishes that the Jewish vote is aligned as Democratic as almost any other point in history. Several political issues, such as Israel, as well as cultural and social influences, such as intermarriage and assimilation, were presented as key factors both in Jewish voting behavior and rational behind the predicted Republican shift. In addition, the 2006 election was presented as a primary example of both the current Democratic alliance of the Jewish community as well as the ways in which Republican Jewish organizations have manipulated data in attempts to hail the opposite. In the end, the 2006 election exposed a reaction against Republican policy by Jewish voters, and further proved the prematurity of such a prediction. Nevertheless, there are many forces attempting to persuade Jewish voters to the Republican Party. It remains to be seen what the future holds for the multifaceted and reactionary voting behavior of the American Jewish community and whether their long-standing affinity with the Democratic Party will remain unbroken.",62.41,56.34,40.94,29.34,46672
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,America's Undercover Racism,"Almost 250 years of slavery and another 100 years of legalized subordination created definitive differences between whites and the minority races within the United States of America (Wilkins 4). White Americans are better off in a vast number of areas that include income, wealth, job opportunities, housing opportunities and even incarceration rates. Vast improvements in many of these areas have occurred gradually but lots of improvements are still left for true equality. Within many of this country's formal and informal institutions exists continuing discrimination and the addition of continuing racist behaviors and attitudes contribute to the continuing disparities between races in America. It appears that time has skewed the simple fact that 350 years created large inequalities caused by differential treatment between races and now it is our responsibility to fix them.

The United States of America was founded on a basis of freedom from tyranny while at the same time allowing slavery. After the abolition of slavery there still were countless ways that blacks were discriminated against through laws and prejudices. Over these same decades white Americans were able to live freely, become educated and accumulate wealth over the course of generations. The 1964 Civil Rights Act eliminated many of the laws that allowed continued discrimination against African Americans. At this point African Americans were still far disadvantaged from whites because of the wealth that was passed from generation to generation by the whites. These decades created extreme differences that would take lots of effort from everyone to reverse. A sweeping new government policy called affirmative action was created to overcome this human damage and to ensure continued progress toward equality (Kotz 1).

Since the inception of affirmative action, government statistics show that blacks have narrowed the gap, but continue to lag significantly behind whites in employment, income, education and access to health care (Morin 1). Unfortunately, while this is the truth, ignorance prevails among many white Americans in that majorities believe that the average black American is faring about as well or better then the average white American. This incorrect belief has fueled many white American's opposition to the affirmative action programs that are striving to correct these inequalities.

These continued inequalities can be partly contributed to the policies practiced by institutions in America. Some of these informal institutions include the labor market and housing market. Compared to whites, African Americans are twice as likely to be unemployed and earn nearly 25 percent less when they are employed (Council of Economic Advisers, 1998). Within the labor market studies have proven that African Americans face differential treatment when applying for jobs. One study tested this by sending equivalent resumes to employers with the only difference being the name (white or black sounding). This study found that just by changing the name on the resume they received 50% less callbacks for the black sounding name. The results imply that employers use race as a factor when reviewing resumes (Bertrand 997).

Using a similar method the Housing Discrimination Study found that discrimination has decreased but still persists in the housing market of large metropolitan areas across the country (Turner 3). The study found this by pairing similar people (one white and one black) and sending them to housing units to inquire about the availability of the advertised housing units. Due to this inequity black Americans face increased costs in searching for a house, barriers in choosing a house and continued racial and ethnic segregation (Turner 1).

While improvements are still needed in the informal institutions within America, there is also a lot of improvement needed in the formal institutions. Throughout this country's history discrimination has been inherit in a wide variety of formal institutions. After the emancipation proclamation the south had Jim Crow laws and after the 1964 Civil Rights Act discrimination was not eliminated, only downsized and hidden. Even after World War II the G.I. Bill tended to benefit the white veterans disproportionately more than the black veterans (Kotz 2).

Today, as politicians earn more votes by cracking down on crime, blacks are almost five times more likely than whites to be in jail (U.S. Department of Justice). The laws slant towards incarceration of black Americans. The 100 to 1 law punishes people in possession of only 5 grams of crack cocaine (used by poor, often black communities) to serve a mandatory 5 year sentence. To receive the same sentence while carrying the more privileged drug of choice (mainly used by white Americans), powder cocaine, a person would need to possess in access of 100 grams. This shows how laws have contributed to the fact that black Americans are 14% of the nations illegal drug user but at the same time make up 74% of the people in America that serve time for drug possession (Markus).

While everything seems hopeless it can be comforting to remember that today's world is much better than it was before. However, American's cannot be too comforted by that fact, but instead they should use it as motivation to continue the trend and eliminate the inequalities. Throughout my life I feel that my parents have done just that, they have raised me in a colorblind setting. It also helps that my father himself is an immigrant to the United States. During the course of my life thus far I have encountered many times that people use stereotypes and ignorance in their racist endeavors. At the same time, I always believed African Americans to be equals and now understand how they should be equals but are not quite there yet. I have always felt a large desire to promote equality in America but have been clueless about how to. Now I feel my best chance will be to openly confront racism wherever I see it and to thereby create an open discussion about it.

Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Disability Rights,"In August of 2004 attorney Richard Bernstein filed a class-action lawsuit against the Detroit and US departments of transportation on behalf of five wheelchair users. Their claim was that the Detroit public bus system was not complying with the federal American's with Disabilities Act in maintaining wheelchair lifts in all buses. Nearly a year and a half later, the suit was settled and his clients were guaranteed access to city buses, with mechanisms in place to ensure that wheelchair lifts would remain functional. This case was certainly a remarkable victory for Bernstein and his clients against an incredibly large and powerful opponent but this case, like most social change law suits, followed a particular paradigm.

The process began with strong legal advocacy by a determined attorney, who seemed to truly believe in the validity and importance of the case. Bernstein recognized the actions of the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) as blatant discrimination against disabled people and an infringement on their rights. Even with the obvious illegality of the situation, Bernstein and his clients did not ask for any monetary compensation for their trouble but simply wanted a solution to the problem. Bernstein mounted his legal front against the City of Detroit like a political campaign. He tried to build grassroots support for his case, knowing that politicians would support his efforts if he could win over their constituents.

Bernstein turned his clients' case into an issue that personally affected all Detroit residents by involving the Federal Transit Administration and prompting the state to withhold millions of dollars in funds from the City for the bus system's failings. Furthermore, Bernstein rallied support in the community by contacting numerous media outlets in order to publicize his issue. In effect, he created a political liability for Mayor Kilpatrick's reelection campaign. Soon local politicians, such as state representative Marc Shulman of West Bloomfield, began to publically side with Bernstein's clients in the case in order to remain favorable in the eyes of their own constituents.

As the case gained popularity in local communities, major media outlets, such as The Detroit Free Press, WWJ Newsradio 950, and The Oakland Press began covering the story. Bernstein was fortunate to win the attention and support of journalist Jerry Wolffe of The Oakland Press who used his column to generate more public attention and support for the case. Through the successful media coverage a lawyer at the US Department of Justice became aware of the case and contacted Bernstein to help in the negotiations between the two parties. The combination of strong legal advocacy, grassroots support, and effective media coverage eventually resulted in significant social change as the class-action suit was finally resolved just days before the Detroit mayoral elections. The agreement was a substantial victory for disabled citizens and recently, after the final negotiations were complete, a similar case was also won by a group of disabled citizens in Boston.

Just as Ravitz and Stamler learned in their class-action suit against the DDOT in the late 1980's, cases such as Bernstein's cannot be won in a federal court system without external pressures forcing the issue. It was Bernstein's manipulation of grassroots organizing and media coverage which gave strength and power to his argument, and ultimately brought about social change.",0,0,0,0,3484
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Does BCRA really work? An investigation into the Re-election of Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur.,"Since her election on November 2, 1982, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur has served Ohio's District 9, which includes Toledo and the area surrounding Lake Erie from the west extending towards the Cleveland area. Congresswoman Kaptur received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wisconsin in 1968 and a Masters in Urban Planning from the University of Michigan in 1974. She currently serves on the Appropriations and Budget committees as well as the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; the Subcommittee on Defense; and the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Congresswoman Kaptur focuses on concerns of agriculture, defense/foreign affairs, energy independence, healthcare, international relations, jobs and the economy, seniors, and trade. In most of her re-election campaigns, Congresswoman Kaptur has been challenged, but with little support. Her candidates have struggled to raise money and with over $800,000 cash on hand currently, it makes it unlikely a formidable challenger would try to challenger her in 2008.

Describing the makeup of District 9 might help to explain the diverse donations. For years Toledo has been home to Chrysler Jeep, which has housed many UAW jobs. Toledo has been known as a strong union city that supports Democratic candidates. The rest of the district, outside of Toledo, has a different makeup. Much of District 9 is heavily Republican, including the counties of Ottawa, Erie, and Lorain. Much of District 9 is rural and farm country. Manufacturing and agriculture industries dominate District 9, however, the district is also home to two state universities (Bowling Green State University and University of Toledo), which depend on federal research grants; as well as Cedar Point, a major tourist attraction; and many other businesses and country clubs supported by business owners. In spite of the diversity of District 9, the constituents of Congresswoman Kaptur have both supported her at the polls and supported her through financial contributions.

Dennis Johnson, the President of Brooks Insurance in Toledo, Ohio, and a member of Inverness Country Club (notoriously Republican) in Toledo, was a contributor to Congresswoman Kaptur's campaign for the 2005-2006 election cycle. Mr. Johnson serves on the Maumee Valley Growers committee, which seeks to address issues related to the floriculture industry as well as the loss of family-owned businesses. The Maumee Valley Growers is a group of small independent businesses in the Toledo area that pool their resources together in order to make a bigger difference in the community as a group than they would on their own. Their approach is one of economic development. Different companies that are a part of the Maumee Valley Growers have been pitching ideas that are aimed at being more cost effective for businesses. Mr. Johnson's company, Brooks Insurance, was working on a proposal for liability insurance for local farmers. The perk would be for local farmers to purchase insurance at a lower rate, thereby increasing their own profit. Besides there being members that are growers, there are non-growers that are part of the Maumee Valley Growers as well. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur is one such member. Congresswoman Kaptur, in the first year the Maumee Valley Growers was assembled, was able to secure $240,000 from the Department of Agriculture for the Maumee Valley Growers. The following year she brought in $667,000 for the group.

Arguably, because of Congresswoman Kaptur's help in securing financing for the Maumee Valley Growers and because of her interaction with Dennis Johnson, she received $500 in contributions to her campaign. It is likely Mr. Johnson realized the work she had done for the group, hoped to secure more financing, and would like to see her to continue to work on behalf of farmers and in the field of agriculture, which supports his business in the insurance industry. In 2006, Congresswoman Kaptur also has supported the interests of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors 75 percent of the time—giving yet another reason why Mr. Johnson's contribution to Congresswoman Kaptur's re-election campaign was in his interest.

James Ruvolo, former head of the Ohio Democratic Party and a constituent of Congresswoman Kaptur's, also donated to the Congresswoman's re-election campaign. Mr. Ruvolo is currently a political consultant for Ruvolo & Associates, and like Mr. Johnson, is also a member at Inverness Country Club in Toledo. Mr. Ruvolo assisted in the writing of the report Democracy at Risk: The 2004 Election in Ohio—sponsored by the Democratic National Committee. His involvement on the committee that reviewed the 2004 Presidential election in Ohio, previous work as chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, and his work on the presidential campaigns of three recent Democratic candidates demonstrates his partisanship. It appears Mr. Ruvolo donated the $500 to Congresswoman Kaptur because of his political leaning and his past support of Democratic candidates as shown through his leadership in the Democratic Party.

The third individual that seems to have a motive for contributing to Congresswoman Kaptur's re-election campaign is Patricia Connell. Ms. Connell is the only out of state person I selected—she is a resident of Westfield, New Jersey. She is the Director of Connell Rice & Sugar Corporation. Over the past election cycle, she contributed $96,000 to candidates and campaign committees across the country--$18,000 to House candidates, including $2,000 to Congresswoman Kaptur.

In looking over the other contributions Ms. Connell made, it is clear she only gave to Democratic candidates in the House and Senate. She did not even donate to the campaign of the congressman in her house district—Republican Michael Ferguson. Ms. Connell did not target all the members of one committee in Congress, but rather spread her donations over a few committees and subcommittees relating to her interests, which seem to indicate what she would like her contributions to accomplish—legislation that is favorable to her and her company. The committees Ms. Connell targeted in the house are Agriculture (Rep. Stephanie Herseth-Sandlin [D-SD], Rep. Earl Pomeroy [D-ND], and subcommittee member Rep. Marcy Kaptur [D-OH]), Subcommittee on Water Resources (Rep. Ellen Tauscher [D-CA] and Rep. Doris Matsui [D-CA]), Budget (Rep. Robert E. Andrews [D-NJ]) and the Subcommittee on Income Security (Rep. Mike McNulty [D-NY]). All of these committees seem to relate to Connell Rice & Sugar Corporation.

Besides individual contributors, numerous Political Action Committees (PACs) donated to Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur's campaign, each for different reasons and each in a different sector of business.

One of the PACs that donated to Congresswoman Kaptur's re-election campaign was the United Auto Workers (UAW). The UAW contributed $10,000 to her campaign—the most to any candidate. Throughout her time in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Kaptur has been very supportive of labor unions. Vote-Smart.org found that in 2006 Congresswoman Kaptur's votes on all pieces of legislation that could affect the UAW the Congresswoman sided with the UAW. Arguably, part of this support for union workers comes from the presence of Jeep in Toledo as well as the presence of other strong unions in District 9. Three pieces of legislation for sure could be seen as benefiting UAW, legislation Congresswoman Kaptur has supported or is currently supporting. Kaptur co-sponsered H.R. 2 (110th Congress), which called for an increase in the Federal Minimum Wage. She also co-sponsered H.R. 800 which sought to amend the National Labor Relations Act, making it more labor friendly. She also introduced H.R. 1958, which has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. H.R. 1958 would call for the withdrawal of normal trade relations with China. Undoubtedly, all pieces of legislation support the UAW. Even though the legislation on the National Labor Relations Act does not directly affect the UAW, it does support the strength of other potential unions across the country, which does support the overall union movement. The piece of legislation referring to trade relations with China might be the most helpful to the UAW, however, possibly saving jobs.

Teledyne Technologies, a defense industry specializing in aerospace products that has an office located in Toledo, gave three separate contributions to Congresswoman Kaptur's campaign--$1,000 (on May 9, 2006), $5,000 (on June 9, 2006), and $4,000 (on June 16, 2006) for a total of $10,000. There seem to be a few motivations for Teledyne Technologies contributions to Congresswoman Kaptur's re-election. Congresswoman Kaptur co-sponsered H.R. 1773, which sought to limit the authority of the Secretary of Transportation in commercial dealings with Mexico. A major part of Teledyne Technologies is wireless and satellite communications. It is possible that the Thousand Oaks, CA based company feared a loss of business prior to the bill being introduced. Congresswoman Kaptur, an avid opponent of NAFTA and CAFTA, became an ally of Teledyne Technologies, keeping United States jobs in the United States. Another part to this contribution could the business Congresswoman Kaptur brought to Teledyne. In late 2004, Kaptur announced a joint venture for a small engine turbine, which she secured $1.3 million for. Teledyne was part of this venture. The bill that included this appropriation was the 2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. It seems likely that the business brought through the appropriation was another influence on Teledyne to donate to Kaptur's re-election campaign—as thanks for the work she did and hopes of future beneficial work she might do for the company.

Besides being a big union supporter and recognizing the importance of keeping jobs in the United States—and locally whenever possible—Congresswoman Kaptur has always been concerned about the agribusiness sector, which is huge in District 9. It makes sense that the Dairy Farmers of America made two separate $1,000 contributions toward Kaptur's re-election campaign (May 20, 2006 and September 25, 2006). For the 2005-2006 year, Congresswoman Kaptur received a 100% approval rating for supporting the interests of the National Farmers Union. There is no doubt that some members of the National Farmers Union also are a part of the Dairy Farmers of America. Recently, the House passed H.R. 2419; the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007. One part of the bill, which Congresswoman Kaptur voted yes on, directly pertained to the Dairy Farmers of America, Section 1401, which states, Supports the price of dairy products by requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to buy cheddar cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk made from milk produced in the United States. Two other pieces of legislation that could have an effect on the Dairy Farmers of America are currently in committees. H.R. 2462, which would amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, is currently in a subcommittee. It is also possible that by contributing to Kaptur, the Dairy Farmers of America want Kaptur to keep in mind they supported her during her re-election before she casts her vote—if the bill makes it out of the subcommittee. The other piece of legislation is H.R. 2766, National Dairy Equity Act of 2007. The bill is currently in the House Committee on Agriculture. Stabilization and an increase in income would definitely benefit the Dairy Farmers of America.

Based on three of the individual contributors and three of the PACs there are different reasons for contributing to a candidate for political office. Some contribute because of the proven track record a candidate has for support of that industry, like support of labor and agribusiness by Congresswoman Kaptur. Others contribute out of allegiance to the party, like Mr. Ruvolo. Still others seem contribute for help on a bill or series of bills that would affect their industry in a drastic way, like what seems to be the case with Teledyne Technologies, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Connell.

With the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, contributions of soft money and contributions to congressional campaign committees changed. With the ban on soft money, the parties looked to new sources to make up for the money they stood to lose: new soft money and increased donations by the candidate and individuals to the congressional campaign committees. Two of the three individuals selected who contributed to Congresswoman Kaptur's re-election campaign also made contributions in the form of new soft money—James Ruvolo and Dennis Johnson. Patricia Connell made a contribution to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).

By contributing to the new soft money, individuals could be doing different things. It could involve supporting a 527 that represents their interests, or it could involve supporting a party at the state level, many of which are 527s. James Ruvolo donated a total of $2,000—two $1,000 donations—toward the Democratic Party of Ohio. Mr. Ruvolo's support of the Democratic Party of Ohio and Congresswoman Kaptur seems fairly clear—Mr. Ruvolo was chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party from 1982 until 1991, as well as serving as a representative for the election campaigns of presidential candidates Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and John Kerry. Mr. Ruvolo is a partisan—he donated to support his congresswoman and donated to support the political party he worked for—he gave over a decade of service to the party.

Dennis Johnson, besides donating to Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur's re-election campaign, also donated a total of $1,000, in two $500 donations, towards the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. Reflecting on his contribution to Congresswoman Kaptur, it was possible his decision was influence by his business, which benefited from a grant secured by Kaptur for the Maumee Valley Growers. Taking that same idea of his business leading him to contribute, it is safe to say it is the same case here with deciding to donate to the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. He trusts that the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers will support his interests as the president of Brooks Insurance in whatever they decide to do with his contribution.

Unlike the donations of Mr. Ruvolo and Mr. Johnson, which were to 527s—the new soft money—Patricia Connell's contribution was to the DCCC. Because of BCRA's ban on soft money, national congressional campaigns and candidates would have to find a new way to fundraise. An increase in hard money contributions can be noted in a few places: contributions of $200 or less, contributions of a candidate to the party committees (which had no limit), and an increase in donations toward the national congressional campaigns. Ms. Connell falls into the last group. Her donation of $25,000 is the maximum she could give to the DCCC in the 2005-2006 election cycle. It also seems to represent the effort of the DCCC to seek her out and secure her donation for the most allowable by an individual contributor to a national congressional campaign committee. One thing is for certain, she did not intend to use a joint committee approach with Congresswoman Kaptur—where she would donate the maximum amount to the candidate and donate more towards the national campaign committee with the intention of having the money moved to the candidate's campaign. In looking over Congresswoman Kaptur's fundraising, there is no donation to her on behalf of the DCCC, showing that the joint committee approach is not the case here. It is possible, however, that a joint committee approach could have been done with the other congressional candidates she contributed to, since she selected a sizable amount across the country. It is also possible she is just a loyal Democrat and besides giving the maximum possible to most candidates, she wants to support her party at the national level giving the maximum there, too, while benefiting her own business interests.

Looking at the 2005-2006 election cycle, post-BCRA, means little if the goals and purposes of BCRA are not taken into account. Michael J. Malbin, editor of The Election After Reform, looks at what BCRA was designed to do, what it did accomplish, and attempts to make predictions about what BCRA means for future fundraising. Malbin gives numerous points that lend themselves to discussion in light of contributions to Congresswoman Kaptur's campaign, but four stick out as major points, all pertaining to party support, soft money, and how BCRA affects the future. Based upon the points that Malbin offers and on the analysis I did of Congresswoman Kaptur's fundraising numbers, it appears that the passage of BCRA did eliminate soft money contributions, but at the same time, it led to other ways for congressional candidates to be able to make up for the loss. BCRA, rather, plugged one sort of campaign contribution. As a result, money came in from different directions and at times, unexpected sources.

Malbin argues that there should be an increase in party donor support. He argues that there should be a noticeable increase in contributions for the candidates at the national level as well as the political parties, especially in the 2001-2002 election cycle, with the impending passage of BCRA legislation. Keeping in mind this analysis is only being applied to one Congressional candidate and not any others, there is some what of a mixed review of Malbin's analysis. Looking at fundraising numbers for Congresswoman Kaptur for the 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006 election cycles, it is discernable as to what part of Malbin's analysis fits. For the 2001-2002 election cycle Congresswoman Kaptur received a little over $418,000 in campaign contributions. For the 2003-2004 election cycle she received a little over $660,000. The most recent completed election cycle, 2005-2006, show her bringing in just over $505,000. Based upon this analysis, it is clear that Congresswoman Kaptur's numbers went up significantly between the 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 election cycles. This could be largely attributed to a couple of things—It could be attributed to an increase in hard money contributions to offset the loss of soft money contributions under the passage of BCRA or it could be attributed to the 2003-2004 cycle being one that included a presidential race that attracted more attention and money. Assuming that the contributions to the campaign for the 2003-2004 cycle are largely based on the ban on soft money, Malbin's analysis appears to be correct that there is a significant increase in donations of hard money. If the analysis is done between the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2005-2006 cycle—both off year congressional races—it is clear that campaign contributions to Congresswoman Kaptur increased, by about 20%.

Moreover, in looking at one individual, Mr. Ruvolo, and his previous contributions to the Democratic Party of Ohio, it appears something happened between the 2001-2002 and the 2003-2004 election cycles. In the 2001-2002 cycle, Mr. Ruvolo did not donate to the Democratic Party of Ohio. In the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 cycles, Mr. Ruvolo did donate. This might be attributed to what Malbin discussed—a greater effort on the part of the parties to solicit more donations.

Party donor support also came in the form of unitemized receipts to congressional campaigns—those contributions that are less than $200 in a given cycle to a given candidate. Malbin argued that since the passage of BCRA, there has been an increase in these unitemized contributions, showing another way that money is coming through in different forms to compensate for a loss of soft money. The contributions received could be attributed to a renewed effort by both parties, more so the Democratic Party, to seek contributions from the smaller donors, ones that can't afford to give $2,000, but can afford to give $5 or $10.

Again, the presidential cycle showed the highest point of unitemized contributions to Congresswoman Kaptur's campaign with $181,196. The analysis of the 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 cycles shows a marked increase in contributions from people giving of $200 or less, from $32,233 to $72,212. This could be attributed to a number of factors—It could be attributed to a greater effort on the part of Congresswoman Kaptur to reach out to working class voters in District 9, it could be attributed to assistance on the part of the DNC or DCCC (in providing a staffer or offering fundraising ideas), or it could also be attributed to the make up of District 9—largely rural voters but a sizable amount of union voters too, people that do not make an exorbitant amount of money, but want to be able to contribute to the campaign of Congresswoman Kaptur. Either way, it is apparent that between the two non-presidential election cycles, there is a marked increased in unitemized contributions toward Congresswoman Kaptur's campaign. The smaller donor appears to be a crucial part to successfully fundraising for both political parties.

Congressional members of both parties, post-BCRA, are expected to contribute to the national congressional campaign committees in order to assist fundraising efforts. Malbin says, …the DCCC expected Members to pay party dues between $70,000 and $400,000, depending on their seniority, committee posts, leadership roles, and fundraising history, (Malbin, 2006, p. 42). Assuming this is the case post-BCRA, this would explain the significantly higher contributions on the part of Congresswoman Kaptur towards the DCCC. Kaptur contributed $45,500 to the DCCC in the 2001-2002 cycle. In the 2003-2004 cycle and the 2005-2006 cycle, her contributions increased to $100,000 and $150,000, respectively. Even though Kaptur has been one of the longest serving members of the House, she has not had many leadership roles (although she has served on some of the most important committees), and she the amount she has fundraised pales in comparison to what many other candidates and members fundraise for their candidacy. What might also be interesting to look at, something Malbin focuses less upon, is the contributions by Congressional Members to other Members or Congressional candidates. While there was not an increase between 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 election cycles in contributions by Congresswoman Kaptur to other Members or Congressional candidates, there was a significant increase in the 2005-2006 cycle, where Kaptur contributed a total of $111,000 to House races, as compared with $30,000 (2003-2004) and $43,000 (2001-2002) in the past. This might have to do with making up for her low DCCC contributions. It also might have something to do with the expectation of Democrats picking up more House seats during the 2005-2006 cycle, and the emphasis the party placed on House members supporting their colleagues in tough House races.

Malbin's analysis of an increase of dues to the DCCC by Congressional Members, dues that are unlimited campaign contributions, appears to be another crucial way that parties have adapted to the loss of soft money and substituted it with an increase in hard money contributions.

Malbin makes an argument about future expectations for campaign receipts, specifically relating to the 2005-2006 cycle, It is therefore likely that national committee receipts will decline, as is typical in a midterm election cycle, (Malbin, 2006, p. 35). On the surface it seems as if this argument is plausible. However, looking at the contributions on behalf of Congresswoman Kaptur, this definitely does not apply to her. Congresswoman Kaptur's contributions to the DCCC went up from 2003-2004 to the 2005-2006 cycle. Malbin's argument seems to depend upon the significantly decreased weight of an election in an off year, which is generally the case. However, with the Democratic Party predicted to take back the House in the 2006 election, it is possible the cash reserves for the DCCC increased, at least on the part of Congresswoman Kaptur. In this case, the contributions by a single House Member, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, did not decrease because an off year election, but rather increased in an effort to take back the House.

As what appears to be the case with the findings of Malbin in The Election After Reform, there appears to be a funneling of money through other new sources that parties have come up with in order to make up for the predicted loss of money due to the BCRA ban on soft money. As an example of a House Member who embodies the argument of Malbin, Congresswoman Kaptur has proven Malbin's theory to have some weight, at least on an individual basis. She had shown the greater commitment on the part of House Members to the national party and the greater commitment of the party and House Members towards the smaller contributors—both ways of increasing cash on hand that were not used as widely in the past. While not all of Malbin's points appear to be valid and relate to the fundraising patterns for Congresswoman Kaptur and her financing toward the DCCC, there are certainly points that relate to what has happened since the passage of BCRA and how hard money contributions have changed in the wake of the ban on soft money contributions.",91.74,51.77,35.88,40.44,25419
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,The Many Faces of Populism in Latin America,"Populism is a term that has frequently been used to describe a number of different ways of governing, and the usage has been especially popular when looking at the governance of Latin American countries. In order to judge whether or not populist politics are actually a viable form of governing, it is necessary to discuss what, in fact, populism really is. Many scholars in the field of political science have different theories of what populism entails, and some of the most comprehensive ones come from Kenneth M. Roberts and Margaret Canovan. Each of these authors offers not only a working definition of populism, but also how populist politics is a function (or dysfunction) of democracy. They also offer their views on the term neo populism and what distinguishes this from the classical form of populism that had emerged in past years in Latin American countries. This essay is going to discuss the different (and sometimes similar) contributions that Roberts and Canovan have had to understanding what exactly populism is, what the underlying factors were of the rise and decline of populism in Latin America, what neo populism means, and why understanding populism and neo populism is fundamental to understanding how democracy works in this region.

The first author to be examined here is Roberts. This author offers the definition of populism as, the top-down political mobilization of mass constituencies by personalistic leaders who challenge elite groups on behalf of an ill-defined pueblo, or 'the people' (Roberts, p. 5-6). The key element of this working definition is the emphasis on which methods the charismatic leader utilizes in order to garner the support of the majority of the constituency. By defining populism in this way, Roberts is able to touch upon two very important concepts. The first concept is that the way in which populist leaders mobilize the support of their constituency is not set in stone, especially in terms of economic strategies. The economic rewards that some populist leaders use may include higher wages or industrialization that is primarily led by the state. However, some populist leaders may opt to not use these kinds of material incentives and benefits, and instead appeal to psychological and ideological interests. These kinds of leaders could incite mass mobilization by reinforcing nationalist ideologies or a class-based kind of mobilization that rebels against the social structure that supports a small class of elites (Roberts, p. 6-7). Therefore, leaders that employ populist measures have an array of methods to choose from in order to mobilize the masses and gain their support. This tool kit of populism is one of the reasons that many populist movements do not have an ideological definition that helps to serve as an umbrella under which their actions lie (Roberts, p. 7).

The second concept that Roberts touches upon with his definition of populism is that populist leaders use a top-down form of political mobilization, but they often neglect to create institutions that help to control this effort at mobilization. Therefore, just as with economic or ideological incentives, there is no one way to create (or not create) institutions that would manage and organize the mobilization efforts of populist leaders. For some leaders, such as Perón in Argentina, the organization of civil society takes first place among priorities, and other leaders, such as Fujimori in Peru, depend on having a very personal and accessible relationship with their constituencies and do not have any intermediary organizations available (Roberts, p. 7-8).

Roberts describes the rise and fall of populism in Latin America as waves (Roberts, p. 4). These waves have occurred at two separate times within this region, both of which were critical junctures, or when the economies of Latin American countries were changing (Roberts, p. 4). The first transition that marked a wave of populism was after 1930, during the conversion from rule by an oligarchy and an economy based on exports to politics that included the masses (especially the working and lower classes) and an economy that was led by an industrialization that was controlled and owned by the state. The second wave of populism occurred after the 1982 debt crisis. This economic crisis let neo populist figures step into leadership positions in order to appear to the disorganized masses as a way out of their economic situation.

Now that Roberts's definition of populism and its rise and decline in Latin America has been discussed, it is important to move on to look at what he has to offer to the understanding of neo populism. Roberts never explicitly mentions the word neo populism, but he does offer a look into a new wave, or the second great wave of populist mobilization [which began] at the tail end of the 20th century (Roberts, p. 11). According to Roberts, neo populism began as a response to the feeling of anonymity from the party system that began to occur in many countries within the region. There was a lack of political representation which offered outside figures with populist campaigns the chance to step into the political arena and offer the masses what the parties would not: Representation. Roberts presents the idea that neo populism is basically just a resurging populism that is occurring as a reaction to neo liberal economic policies. Neo populist leaders sometimes choose to combine the populist leadership styles with neo liberal policies. These leaders include Alberto Fujimori in Peru, Carlos Menem in Argentina, and Fernando Collor in Brazil (Roberts, p. 4). Also, with the examples of Chavez in Venezuela and Ollanta Humala in Peru, this author shows that the classical form of populist politics is still utilized by leaders today (Roberts, p. 17).

With the definitions of populism and neo populism that Roberts has given, it is now possible to look at how the understanding of these two concepts is integral to comprehending how democracy functions (or does not) in Latin America. For populist and neo populist leaders, the degeneration of institutions that represent the people is something that they can take advantage of and attack verbally. They call parties and other representative institutions undemocratic and interested only in the welfare of elites and not the masses. In this way, populist leaders provide an alternative to the corrupt form of democracy that is administered by the institutions. Some, including Fujimori of Peru, give the impression that they are the way to practicing a true form of democracy, a direct democracy (Roberts, p. 14). However, the reality of direct democracy is that it provides the leader with the ability to surpass those institutions that would provide a form of checks and balances upon their leadership. This appeal to the masses of the promise of true democracy with no intermediary institutions is what populist leaders bring as a part of their political platform.

The second author, Canovan, has views that will now be discussed regarding populism, the underlying factors of the rise and decline of populist movements in Latin America, neo populism, and how understanding populism and neo populism contribute to understanding how democracy functions in this region. Canovan defines populism as an appeal to 'the people' against both the established structure of power and the dominant ideas and values of the society (Canovan, p. 3). Just as Roberts states, Canovan explains that the methods and values of a populist leader can vary depending on the economic and political context they are in. Also like Roberts’s piece, Canovan explicitly states that populist leaders are not simply part of a reaction against the existing institutions of power, but that they are specifically campaigning on behalf of the authority of the people. Leaders with populist tendencies appeal to usually one of three kinds of ‘the people’: The nation as a whole, an ethnic minority, or the common people who are usually shadowed by an elite class. Canovan elaborates more on the style of populist leaders than Roberts does, and says that they address their constituents with a simple and direct style that avoids the evasiveness given by other kinds of politicians (Canovan, p. 5). Populist leaders tend to foster close personal ties with their followers, and inspire a sort of excitement that seems to be lacking with leaders who are connected to political parties.

In terms of noting the underlying factors of the rise and fall of populist regimes in Latin America, Canovan is not as specific as Roberts in saying exactly when these movements occurred. However, Canovan does agree with Roberts on the point that in times of economic hardship, democratic systems of governance are susceptible to populist reactions. She states that ever since the 1890s the populist reaction has occurred to an unsure democratic power (Canovan, p. 12). Due to the fact that populist leaders are able to take advantage of the weaknesses of democracy, this trend could continually occur into the future.

Neo populism, according to Canovan, was not specifically defined as such, but could be seen in the shift of populism in the 20th century. In the 1940s, there was a shift from Left to Right in populism. This meant that the original populism was a Leftist ideology that was fairly radical and the new populism, or neo populism, was an ideology that created an enmity between the people and the new liberal elite (Canovan, p. 4). However, both populism and neo populism involved charismatic leaders who were intent on mobilizing the masses whose interests were underrepresented by the existing power structures.

Canovan presents an interesting idea of how populism and democracy are intertwined, and therefore how it is impossible to have one without the other. The difference between how these two ways of governing are represented in the United States as opposed to in Latin America lies in how firmly institutions are in place to prevent populist tendencies from overrunning democratic principles. According to Canovan, there are two sides of democracy, which are the redemptive side and the pragmatic side. The redemptive side of democracy is the promise of a better world through action by the sovereign people (Canovan, p. 11). The pragmatic side of democracy includes the multi-party systems, free elections, pressure groups, lobbying and institutions (Canovan, p. 11). These two sides must intertwine so that democracy does not just become an institutionalized ritual that has no redemptive qualities to it and also so that it does not dissolve into pure populism with no institutional control over the actions of the executive. In this way, populism is a natural occurrence with the onset of democracy, but it is in how balanced the two sides of democracy are that the different kinds of governance can be seen.

With the views and theories purported by Canovan and Roberts, the similarities and differences can be seen between their definitions of populism, their descriptions of the factors underlying the rise and fall of this governing style, their definitions of neo populism, and the way they see the relevance of populism and neo populism for understanding how democracy functions in Latin America. While populism has historically been considered to be an assault on democracy, it can also be seen as a necessary component of a democratic governing style. Therefore, there must be at least a little bit of populism for democracy to work in the way that it should, instead of dissolving from pressure by leaders with populist agendas.",70.33,35.74,10.81,14.41,11621
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,Violence and the Nation,"Introduction: Fear and the Nation
The modern nation has a tendency to turn to violence of catastrophic proportions. The most horrific events of the twentieth century, from everyday ingrained hatreds to systematic ethnic cleansing and genocide, ultimately must be attributed to conflicts between nations. Something about the nature of the nation and the national identity of an individual motivates men to not only die for the nation, but to kill for the nation.

There is no question that the nation at the most basic level serves as a central source of identity, from the songs people sing, the legends people tell, the languages people speak, and symbols with which people associate. Nations define individuals, and so people come to love the nation. However, as Stuart Hall points out in his essay Ethnicity: Identity and Difference, an inevitable step in the formation of a national identity is to conceptualize it with relation to difference (Hall 346). For example, one may say I am a Communist and not a Capitalist ; the Capitalist does not have to directly harm the Communist in order to make this assertion so long as the Capitalist has an offensive presence within the imagination of the Communist. A more tangible example comes via a poll taken by the Belgrade Institute for Social Sciences in which 89 percent of [Serbia's] ethnic Serbs viewed ethnic Serbs favorably, compared to 81 percent disliking ethnic Albanians, 75 percent disliking Muslim Slavs, and 74 percent disliking ethnic Croats (Ron 31). The love of one's self is made possible by the contempt of that which one is not.

This duality directly applies in discussion of the nation. If, as Ernst Renan writes, the nation is a large-scale solidarity between a people who share a past and desire a shared future, then the people who share neither a common past nor a desire for a shared future must lack solidarity (Renan 53). While this is not so much a universal truth as it is a nationalistic perception, this perception breeds a fundamental tension between the nation and the outsider. This tension creates fear.

The tendency of the nation to resort to violence must ultimately be attributed to the fear posed by an outside threat. If one loves the nation and has regard for the continued preservation of the nation, then one cannot help but feel threatened by those who can either harm or destroy the nation. The Israeli Soldier fights not only because he or she loves the Jewish people and the state of Israel but because he or she fears the second coming of the Holocaust (that, and the state requires military service). The American will risk his or her life fighting in the Middle East because he or she loves western society and fears terrorism and the effects of radical Islamism. The nation turns to violence when it perceives its core existence to be under threat.

American Nationalism: ""Emergency without End""
American nationalism originally felt a strong influence from a Protestant-based mindset that America was a new chosen people, an utmost civil and modern society who would be the pioneers of the western world. This messianic self-imagining did not necessarily function to mobilize the American people, although appeals to morality (fight evil, promote freedom,) could inspire support for taking action (Lieven 34). Despite the sometimes religious qualities of American nationalism, post-manifest-destiny America lacked the thirst for empire and the stomach for long international conflict. Only when the American national identity (or perhaps, the American national ideology) is under attack does American nationalism lend itself to conflict and violence.

Anatol Lieven, author of America Right or Wrong, points to the Cold War as a turning point in which an ideological threat motivated permanent mobilization. The Soviet Union essentially launched an offensive against America as a nation with its attempts to globalize communism. Fighting international bourgeois society meant fighting capitalism and democracy, two hallmark traits of the western world. With an ideological threat constantly simmering in the background, America entered into a state of emergency without end to protect its way of life from the militant Bolsheviks (156). The Cold War was officially underway, with America partaking in several conflicts (including larger scale wars in Korea and Vietnam) directly related to keep Soviet communism from overwhelming Western-friendly societies.

The precedent set by the American experience in the Cold War appears to be repeating in the post 9/11 years. The September 11 attacks dealt a catastrophic blow to the American nation, a rude awakening of sorts that America was more vulnerable than originally thought. Following the grief and the shock of the event, patriotism and nationalism skyrocketed. A national sentiment that arose (and was voiced by the American elites) was that the public had the obligation to carry on living as they had prior to the attack as any sort of concession would be conceding a victory to the terrorists (24). More than ever, the Americans imagined themselves as a messianic figure amongst the nations and had a newfound obligation to fight terror.

America has mobilized itself once again, now justifying state-sanctioned violence by fighting an abstract war against the terrorists instead of the Bolsheviks. The frightened American public essentially gave the Bush Administration a complete mandate to respond to the new terrorist threat with any sort of military action necessary. Bush capitalized on this,

[instilling] in the American public a fear of much wider threats to the homeland from Iraq, Iran, and North Korea—states which had no connection to al Qaeda. By doing so, the administration created a belief that anything America does is essentially defensive and a response to ""terrorism."" (27)

At this point, the final steps to unlimited war and constant mobilization were finalized. The transition was complete: America converted the fear from international ideological attacks into an unlimited mandate to carry out a war.

Israel and the Middle East
Much like the aforementioned example of America, the link between a fearful nation and the escalation of violence can be found in the case of Israel. Ideological tensions are at the root of American action; the tensions felt by the Jewish nation are far more primal and subsequently graver. Whereas the anti-American seeks to forcefully promote a non-Western way of life, the anti-Zionist seeks the total destruction of the Jewish national homeland. Hence, the right to exist is at stake for Israel.

The foundation for this Jewish national fear lies deep, with the nearly two thousand year experience in Diaspora an essential factor. However, the threat of total annihilation became a very real possibility over the past century as modern anti-Semitism arose from the simmering anti-Jewish sentiments ingrained within several European societies. Norman M. Naimark goes into great detail how Nazi Germany sought initially to ethnically cleanse the Reich of the Jews as to avoid impure Jewish blood from infiltrating and tainting the Aryan gene pool; plans to expel the Jews to such places as Palestine and Madagascar were seriously explored (Naimark 61-69). As World War II began to break out in full force, ethnic cleansing gave way to an attempt to completely eradicate the Jewish people. Six million lives later, the necessity for the Jews to have an autonomous homeland capable of defending the nation was very clear.

As a nation, the Jewish people told themselves never again. The establishment of the state of Israel provided the much-needed homeland and wars fought in 1948, 1956, and 1967 showed the world that Israel had every intention of militarily protecting both statehood and the wellbeing of the nation inside. With the protection of the Jews from global anti-Zionist threats being the highest priority to Israel, tactics that were both proactive and aggressive became commonplace in Israeli policy.

To this end, James Ron points to the rise of the right wing Likud party in 1977 as a turning point in Israeli aggression. Ron spends considerable time writing about Israel and the state-sponsored violence that ensues following the rise of Likud in his book Frontiers and Ghettos. Ron goes so far in his criticisms of the policy and actions carried out by Israel during this period that he labels the trend as radicalized nationalism (Ron 115). While Ron is correct in his assertion that the Israeli public at large experienced a shift to the right during this period, he fails to credit this to a devastating event that rekindled old fears among the Israeli people.

The Yom Kippur War of 1973 was a catastrophic blow to Israel. Israel was caught off guard by Egypt and Syria and, although ultimately defeating the two Arab nations, sustained serious losses. The war served as a reality check that, despite the general goodwill garnered by the Six Day War, Israel was still a vulnerable state with enemies who sought complete destruction of the state (Rabinovich http://info.jpost.com/C003/Supplements/30YK/art.23.html). Israel was shocked and fundamentally unprepared for the offense; the aftermath of the Yom Kippur war led to the realization that the continued existence of a Jewish homeland for the Jewish nation predicated on future proactive and aggressive military tactics.

A result of the Yom Kippur War was that Israel vowed never to let its guard down again. The Arab world essentially poses the same fundamental threat that Nazi Germany posed some sixty years earlier. This proactive and aggressive mindset in protecting the Jewish people translates into internationally unpopular tactics in matters of foreign policy, particularly the Palestinian conflict. However, the Jewish people learned the hard way that the preservation and protection of a Jewish state is the highest priority and that the means of doing so justify the ends.

Serbia and the Crisis of Identity
The last case study to look at is the case of post-Communist Serbia in the years immediately following the dissolution of the Yugoslav Republic. Unlike America, where a threat to the Western democratic way of life is an ideological struggle that has reignited following the September 11 attacks and Israel, where international anti-Zionist hostility threatens the continued existence of the Jewish nation, the existence of the Serbian nation never seemed to face direct assault. Undoubtedly there was tension in the 1990's Balkans, but with the possible exception of Tito's Yugoslavia, ethnic tension has been a constant in the region for ages.

The ideological currents running through Serbia were producing a dangerous form of fervent patriotism. Norman Naimark relates the assessment of U.S. ambassador Warren Zimmermann on the rise of a pan-Serbian voice, writing In the Balkans, intellectuals tend to be standard bearers of nationalism; in Serbia, this is carried to fetishistic lengths (Naimark 149). The Serbian elite, led by Slobodan Milošević, had just experienced the frustration of having a fragmented and disproportionately small voice within the Yugoslav Federation and vividly remembered the past glories of the old Serbian kingdom. Hence, an agenda in which Serbia would expand and expel the non-Serbs (mainly Bosniaks, Croats, and Kosovar Albanians) was undertaken.

The question of how the Serbian nation could support the catastrophic violence in the Bosnian Frontiers, Sandžak, Vojvodina, and Kosovo comes back to a latent fear to which the Serbian elites appealed. The fear was not so much a fear of being attacked, despite the serious tensions felt by ethnic Serbs living in Bosnia and Kosovo and the rise of the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA) between 1996 and 1998 (Ron 95). Instead, the Serbian identity that was at stake.

Serbia felt the need to exert themselves in order to strengthen an identity that had taken a shot during the end of the Yugoslav years. The Serbian national idea demanded that all historically-Serbian lands be unified with Serbia proper. This expansionist idea not only aimed to create a state that would encompass all ethnic Serbs but would also homogenize the population. While the first conflicts took place to the West (Bosnia) and North (Vojvodina), Kosovo held a special significance to the Serbs as it is a focal point in Serbian history. The land, which has attained an almost-holy stature amongst the Serbs, was the site of the historic 1389 battle with the Ottomans that fortified the Serbian identity (28). That some 90 percent of modern Kosovars were not Serbs but Muslim Albanians was unacceptable to the Serbs and an affront to the Serbian nation. If a people and their shared history are two fundamental components to the conceptualization of a nation, then the Serbian nation was threatened by the fact that Serbs had become ethnic minorities in historically significant Serb lands.

It is insufficient to credit a national identity crisis to justify the ethnic cleansing efforts that killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions more. However, the public was susceptible to be swayed by radical elites who were able to play off of Serbian insecurities to implement drastic measures. The fear of losing a distinctly Serbian identity posed a threat to the people that Serbian authorities converted into extreme violence.

Conclusion
Perhaps it is accurate to say that the tendency of the nation to turn to violence is a defense mechanism, a primal instinct for self-preservation. A threat to the nation demands action, whether that threat is directed towards a political ideology, a sense of identity, or simply at a people at large. Just as a mother bear will fight to the death to prevent her cubs from harms way, a nation will resort to any means to protect the nation. The love of a people and a way of life, combined with the fear of losing those cherished factors, will continue to motivate drastic acts of violence for the foreseeable future.",45.01,22.97,7.44,13.57,14028
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,"Human Rights Debates Presented by William Slomanson, Jack Donnelly & Oona Hathaway","The idea of Universal Human Rights (UHR) was largely developed post-World War II alongside the development of the United Nations. While Human Rights ideology has its beginnings thousands of years ago, the practice of universal human rights began with the first Geneva Conventions in 1864, during the American Civil War. The Geneva Conventions focused on the wounded and sick in battle, for all peoples and for all States. The rise of the League of Nations, founded by the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I, was created to end the practice of war to settle disputes, as well as to better the welfare of world citizens. World War II saw the dissembling of the League of Nations, as it failed to stop one of the worst and most inhumane wars in modern world history. The atrocities of World War II, including the genocide of Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Soviets, and many other groups, under the purview of Hitler's Nazi Germany, launched the world community's campaign against Human Rights abuses with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), created under the new United Nations.

Throughout the history of the UDHR, many issues have arisen regarding its ideology and practice. William Slomanson, Jack Donnelly and Oona Hathaway are just some of the many scholars that follow the evolution of UHR. I will provide an overview of the different debates each of them presents, compare and contrast their overlapping debates and finally I will provide my own insight into the debates that the authors present.

Slomanson-The ""Western"" Derivation of Universal Human Rights
William Slomanson, in his chapter on Human Rights, in his textbook Fundamental Perspectives on International Law, provides a history of Human Rights and brings up several debates presented by UHR. One of the debates evolved from the foundation of UHR. Many non-Western States see the UDHR as based on Western cultures and religions and that it fails to take account for the varied cultural and religious differences around the world. The UDHR was created after World War II, where Western hegemony dominated, and therefore, some critics say that the framers lacked input from lesser-developed nations as well as those with more diverse political and social viewpoints.1 The two covenants created in 1966, the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social & Cultural Rights, provided some restitution for these critics. However, there is still a large number of States, including those of Asia, the Middle East and Africa that see these discrepancies in the UHR.

Slomanson provides a section on each of the major regions of the world, and how they have received human rights. He makes it clear in these sections, that because of the Western derivation of UHR, UHR are less respected in the certain regions specified above. In Africa, even though the Organization for African Unity (OAU) has some programs set up to respond to human rights abuses, human rights protection has not seen the same success as in Western regions. Critics say that it is largely because of cultural relativism. Africa tends to perceive human rights as having a broader basis than just the individual. Africans also tend to have a distrust of the internationally derived human rights measures.2 In China, UHR are seen as a pretext for intervention in the internal affairs of socialist nations.3 China, presents an important issue that is shared the world over. Many States, including many of the West, see UHR as an attack on their sovereignty. China, in particular, believes that it is the responsibility of the State to create the internal laws that govern human rights, and not that of the international community.4 Other Asian States, including the democratic, developing and poor ones, take on another issue having to do with the ability to carry out human rights. They say the Western-derived concepts benefit only developed States and that they have little meaning for the States whose people don't even have all of the basic necessities of life.5 Essentially, how can a State provide UHR if they don't have the means to do so?

The Middle Eastern perspective, which is coupled with the Islamic perspective, has to do with their perception of human rights. These States have their own idea of human rights, which largely has to do with their spiritual salvation.6 They are guided by their religion and not by international human rights law.

Donnelly-Human Rights, a Key Piece in the Development of a New Standard of Civilization
Jack Donnelly, in his article Human Rights: A New Standard of Civilization? presents several developments that the existence of human rights has created. The basis of his argument relies on the idea that human rights have changed how States govern their people and how they interact with other States. He argues that human rights have created a new standard of civilization that is in fact a return to something much older than modern international law. He says,

International human rights, rather than a deviation from principles defining the essence of the 'Westphalian' system, represents a return to a conception of international society that is older and morally much more attractive than the positivist vision of pristine sovereignty. 7

Donnelly presents human rights in international relations, as a legitimizing norm. In opposition to scholars such as Hans Morgenthau, Headley Bull, Michael Glennon and Anne-Marie Slaughter, who take an instrumentalist approach to international law, Donnelly sees human rights having evolved into a norm. This norm-approach is what Donnelly calls the New Standard of Civilization. He presents several examples to bolster his argument including an example on genocide and China after Tiananmen.

Donnelly argues that the international response to the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda, mark a significant advance over previous international inaction to genocide, such as in Cambodia. 8 The reaction represents an international concern and opposition to grievous human rights abuses. Donnelly does concede, however, that this new norm has not yet been able to encourage the international community to act before a human rights abuse on such a large scale occurs.9

Another representation of changing international human rights norms occurred after the Tiananmen Square massacre in China. Donnelly suggests that the international campaign against China represents changing norms in international human rights.10 Although China has not changed their human rights behavior since, and the international communities campaign of sanctions has dissipated, this example shows, as Donnelly says, they [international human rights] impose supplementary constraints on the freedom of action of states. He goes one to say, the reality of these constraints, and the importance of asserting the relevance of standards of international justice, are not less important than their limits. 11 This assertion of the changing norms in society, even if just a glimpse of the change, is an important indicator of the effectiveness of such an imposition of rights.

Donnelly then suggests that international norms do have an impact on State practices.12 He uses the move of States towards more democratic governments as an example of this. In Latin America, most States have moved towards electing their governments in open and fair elections. And while their elections incite contestation, the effort itself, is a representation that human rights norms are being recognized and changing State practices. Donnelly adds, that this move towards a democratic environment is not universal, and in many Southeast Asian, and Middle Eastern States, it is unheard of.13 Those States that are not partaking in democratic governing, however, are seeing criticism and facing political costs as a result.14

In his final point, Donnelly says that human rights abuses have been contained within International Human Rights Law and that the incorporation of human rights into international norms shows moral progress.15 He suggests, that not merely the demise of racist imperialism but also the rise of universal human rights ideas presents a story of moral progress. 16 He uses examples in the past, such as the slave trade and its abolition, as representing moral progress that would be uncontested today. He argues that these norms are universal since they apply equally to everyone, and they are unpartisan. Human rights, Donnelly says, represent moral progress, since they find their foundation in an idea that we are all human and, as a result, are equally entitled to certain goods, services, opportunities and protections. 17 This progress is also represented in that States, in order for them to be regarded as legitimate, and in order for them to be full members of international society, must adhere, or make a genuine effort to adhere, to International Human Rights Law.18

Hathaway-The Realities of the International Law of Torture
In Oona Hathaway's article, The Promise and Limits of the International Law of Torture, she presents the realities of what had become of this 1984 law; what States signed on, what States didn't and what States abide by the law, and those that don't. Her article can also be seen as a case study in how States use international law: Whether States take an Instrumentalist approach, like Morgenthau, or whether they take a Normativist approach, like Donnelly.

Hathaway begins her article by stating that even though such a law on torture exists, and has been ratified by many States, the practice of torture still continues today. She sees this revelation as both a moral challenge, as well as a challenge on international law and its ability to impose global order.19 The fundamental question that Hathaway discusses is whether or not international law really works and if it does, how it works. She uses the Convention on Torture as her case study. One end of the debate says, States don't give up the right to engage in torture unless they have no intention of using it anyway. And once they join treaties like the Convention against Torture, States will act no differently from if they had not done so. 20 This argument takes a crude instrumentalist ideology of international law. The other side of the debate argues, States do not simply join treaties that are in their material interests. Rather, States will join a treaty if they are committed to the ideas and goals it embodies, even if doing so may be costly. And once States join…they will abide by their international legal commitments 'most of the time.' 21 This idea represents a more subtle instrumentalist ideology. Hathaway takes another view and argues that international law is effective, but not in the above subtle instrumentalist way. She sees that both [arguments] fail to consider the role of internal enforcement of international treaties on countries' willingness to join and abide by them. She goes on, both, ignore almost completely the indirect effects of treaties on countries' decisions to accept international legal limits on their behavior and then to violate or abide by them. 22 The data Hathaway has collected and presents in this article, reveals that the debate is, indeed, like she says, not black and white, but a complex interwoven amalgam of interests.

Hathaway's evidence supports five conclusions of which I will list. First, States that ratify treaties outlawing torture don't necessarily have better torture practices than those who don't. This excludes enforcement articles 21 and 22 of the Convention. Second, democratic States are more likely to make the legal commitment not to use torture than non-democratic States. Third, democratic States that use torture more frequently are less likely to join the Convention than those who engage in less. Fourth, non-democratic States that use more torture are more likely to join the Convention than those that use it less. And finally, not only does it appear that the Convention does not always have the intended effect of reducing torture in States that ratify, but also, in some cases, the opposite might even be true.23

Hathaway then attempts to account for the reasons why these trends exist. She says that perhaps more torture occurs in some cases because the Convention lacks enforcement measures aside from those that are optional. She then goes on to say, that States abide the law for a variety of reasons, and that the lack of enforcement measures can't simply be the end-all. A reason for why the third finding might be so, is because those States that don't sign on take the law seriously and would impose institutions to combat the torture. Those States might see this as costly, so they decide not to sign on. An answer for the fourth finding, could be that States who have poor torture practices have nothing to lose by signing onto the convention, but those who have relatively good torture practices, have a lot to lose, so they decide not to sign on. Reputation plays a big part in the first finding. Those that sign on and have poor torture practices, do so in order to look good to the world community. By signing on it supposedly shows that the State is making a commitment to ending torture. The State would hope that this commitment would attract aid, FDI, trade, etc.24

Hathaway ends her discussion by providing three lessons learned from the Torture Convention. First, enforcement isn't essential in order to have effective international law, but it is important. She stresses that domestic enforcement, and reputational incentives are other methods used to achieve compliance. Second, domestic institutions are essential for compliance in international law, as long as they serve to enforce international law. And finally, State reputation plays a central role in a State's decisions to participate in and comply with the international torture regime. Hathaway ends, by saying, even though the torture regime has not achieved all that it was meant to achieve, it still has had a normalizing effect in creating the universal view that torture is an unacceptable practice in the world today.25

Comparing Slomanson, Donnelly and Hathaway
These three authors, although discussing several different topic areas in Human Rights, have hit on one main theme seen throughout the human rights debate, consistent in international law; the effectiveness of international law and how it is or why it isn't effective. The authors tend to the normative side of the international law ideology spectrum, but Hathaway presents the instrumentalist view most prominently. The authors present human rights law as having changed State practices throughout its history. Where they differ, is when they try to understand why States don't abide by international human rights law. Albeit, the differences relate to the subject areas and not their individual debates. Slomanson sees international human rights law as failing in areas that weren't included in the creation of the human rights, such as Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Donnelly presents the failures of human rights law as the law still growing, and that the development of a new standard of civilization takes time to grow. Hathaway on the other hand, sees compliance in international human rights law, as an end to a series of other questions and debates, such as institutional reform and reputational incentives.

How I See It
Since, the articles have a wide range of topical debates, I will discuss only the debate that links all three articles. I find Oona Hathaway's perspective on international human rights law to be the most compelling. Although I see how parts of Slomanson and Donnelly fit into her argument, she presents the best case for why States and people abide by international human rights law. But if I'm being realistic, all three of the authors present debates that I agree with. Hathaway's paper, in particular, was most convincing because it provided an in-text analysis of the debate. She provided data to back up her assumptions of both the law of torture and her instrumentalist point of view.

I'm sure that if you asked any of these authors, they would not find international human rights law following any strict instrumental or normative ideology. They would see a mixture of the two. With different debates and issues, different ideology shines most prominently. That is why it is hard to compare these papers, because they deal with separate issues and debates, yet they have a underlying ideology about international law. So perhaps I find Hathaway's article most persuasive because it fits the debate she is speaking towards. However, if you look at Donnelly's issue, it would be hard to deny the influence of international law as a normalizing tool.

The Westphalian international system that we [the world] have been living under for the past four centuries has ingrained the idea of sovereignty into States' institutions. And that sovereignty means that they are the masters of themselves. This means that they have to answer to no one higher. With the creation of the United Nations, a new idea of State sovereignty came to the fore, along with the idea of an international, interdependent global community. This idea has been well received by some, and not so much by others. In the past 64 years, States have come a long way in accepting this new ideology. However, it still has only been 64 years, and old habits/ideologies die hard. It will be some time before international human rights norms take root and become effective across the spectrum of States and human rights issues. Hathaway understands this, but she still sees States governing based on State interests, and still accepting international law based on State interests. She agrees that human rights law has created some normative effects, but that it is still largely in the stages of instrumentalist ideology.

Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,The United Nations' Balance of Sovereignty and International Human Rights﻿,"The United Nations charter is a living document that is constantly reinterpreted with changing social and political ideologies. It is inherent in the Charter that an understanding of the struggle between state sovereignty and human rights exists and it is a mitigating factor when it comes to international intervention. Jack Donnelly sees the future of international human rights activity as a struggle that balances the competing claims of sovereignty and international human rights. 1 It is clear that the United Nations has a hand in both upholding state sovereignty and human rights, however the principles of sovereignty and international human rights in relation to the UN charter are not clearcut and the current ideology is most represented in recent and current UN missons. Starting in the 1990s, increases in conflict around the world that deny some of the most essential human rights, has empowered the UN to sacrifice the traditional Westphalian ideals of sovereignty and move towards a more open and liberal view, giving more time to focus on human rights. However, the debate on sovereingty and intervention still exists and I will attempt to discern the viewpoints of this debate and show a brief history of the most recent transformation of sovereignty ideology in the UN. I will also discuss how the UN Security Council, with its peacekeeping forces and other intervening missions, balances international human rights and state sovereignty. Finally I will discuss in detail the ten-year conflict in Sierra Leone and the UN involvement therein.

The Debate
Ideas about sovereignty change with the evolving social and political thought as well as with current events and it is when practices are not suitable for the current events that sovereignty is reevaluated. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia's view on sovereignty grants nations the authority to exercise a monopoly of power within their borders and implies that one nation cannot intervene in the domestic affairs of another. 2 This view has been essentially the prevailing thought on State Sovereignty since its inception. However other definitions of sovereignty have evolved and they include Interdependence Sovereignty, Domestic Sovereignty and International Legal Sovereignty, which embrace a similar Westphalian definition. 3 This idea is that States are their own entity and do not have to answer to anyone higher regarding their territories.

While this is still the main view today, ideas about sovereignty are changing with regard to the responsibility states have to their citizens and the right of the international community to intervene when states do not uphold their citizens' basic human rights. The United Nations, at its creation, took on the initiative that it had a responsibility to protect both morally and legally. When diplomatic measures fail, the UN through their Peace and Security force missions intervene. These missions represent the extremes the UN might face when balancing sovereignty and international human rights.

Article two, chapters six and seven of the UN charter (4) defines the stipulations that frame UN intervention. The UN was careful to create a provision that was up for different interpretations, so for instance, today's idea of domestic jurisdiction, with civil unrest current throughout the world, is seen differently from back in the late 1940s when perhaps a stricter view on domestic jurisdiction prevailed. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations addressed this idea of National Sovereignty and also reenforced a new Security Council mandate, he said, National Sovereignty can be set aside if it stands in the way of the Security Council's overriding duty to preserve international peace and security. 5 Annan addressed this duty to preserve international peace and security shortly before appointing a high-panel challenged to examine threats, challenges and change. The final report addressed those issues while focusing equally on the military and nonmilitary dimensions of collective security, turning first to the ""challenge of prevention,"" then to the use of force, and finally to institutional reform within the United Nations. 6 The new interpretations of the UN Charter emphasize the preamble's We the Peoples of the United Nations, so that the UN can further justify its responsibility to all peoples of the world to uphold their human rights. He's not necessarily inferring to abolish state sovereignty, but rather to redefine its place in relation to other international laws.

Perhaps the debate, then, is not on the right of the United Nations to intervene, but on when and how the UN should intervene when human rights are being denied. The right to intervene can only be decided by the UN Security Council and is governed by chapters six and seven of the Charter. Practice has shown that in most UN missions, peacekeeping missions and other non confrontational missions are the only missions deployed. Paolini, et.al., expresses that, A (non-peacekeeping) intervention ought to be undertaken only if the difference between the two sides, on the merits, is great and is of broad and legitimate international concern or the fighting is literally a threat to peace in the sense of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. 7 These types of stipulations placed on the UN Security Council keep it from acting in the most effective way. However, this poor performance with non-confrontational missions comes from the duty to respect State Sovereignty as well as to protect. The Security Council is fraught with the issue on how to intervene in the way that best resolves the crises and respects the UN Charter. 8 In addition to Chapters six and seven, there are three pieces of framework that the Security Council uses to decide on whether it will intervene. These include: Just Cause, Precautionary Principles and Right Authority. Just Cause is necessary in order to make sure there is no self-interest in the cause. Precautionary Principles include: Reasonable chance for success, exit-strategy, force as last resort, focused intervention, and right intention. These principles format a justification for intervention and define the type of intervention that will be undertaken. Right Authority refers to who is intervening and whether it is respectable or not. The United Nations will tend not to support unilateral authority. Multi-lateral and regional are preferred. Because it keeps states from intervening for their own self-interest. 9

The United Nations has a duty to both protect the rights of people and the sovereignty of States. Disrespect of either, may lead to failure of the United Nations as an organization or contempt throughout the nations. Balancing human rights and sovereignty is wrought with many obstacles that the UN has both failed and succeeded in. Through these successes and failures, however, State Sovereignty and human rights become more defined and present in the world and therefore creates a standard body of precedents that the UN can look to in order to promote human rights throughout the world.

The UN and Human Rights Missions
Rwanda represents one of the United Nations and the world's biggest failures in human rights intervention. Hesitation and denial were prevalent themes throughout this highly charged, fast paced degradation of human rights in Rwanda from April 2004 to July 2004. The UN failed to act quickly and when it did act, it acted insufficiently. Hesitation on the UN Security Council's part on whether to intervene and in what way served to ultimately decimate the population of Rwanda. 10

Rwanda is the worst-case scenario when it comes to the balancing of sovereignty and human rights within the UN. The UN held off on Rwanda for so long, because of the simple definition of genocide that the UN was unwilling to use, because calling Rwanda a genocide would legally hold them accountable. Though many factors played into the United Nations' decision to obstain from intervening in Rwanda, the overarching factor for keeping the UN out, was the definition of genocide. If there was no genocide then legally the UN, under the Charter, did not need to go in.

The United Nations' next big mission was in Sierra Leone. Following the Rwanda crisis, the United Nations stepped it up with Sierra Leone, having it critically acclaimed as a successful mission. This represents the trial and error existence of the UN Security Council actions as well as the evolution of sovereignty under chapter VI and VII. I will go into further detail about the UN in Sierra Leone in the following section. With the success of Sierra Leone, it is easy to say that the UN has dealt with some of its issues on sovereignty and intervention and perhaps has come to a set precedent on dealing with these crises. But, however, each case is different, and the problems in the Darfur region of Sudan and the recent and overdue July 2007 intervention by the UN proves that there is no strict guidelines and human rights abuses, sovereignty and intervention are things that the UN constantly struggles with.

A Case Study: Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone, as I mentioned earlier is the most successful United Nations intervention to stop human rights abuses and shows the power and capabilities of the United Nations to act in a timely manner to right the wrongs and initiate peace.

The Sierra Leone ten-year civil war represented some of the most grievous human rights abuses of recent time. The main rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), supported by former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, instigated the civil war when it invaded eastern Sierra Leone in 1991. A largely political war, rather than ethnic war, the RUF did not distinguish between victims. Civilians, children, men, women and peoples of all ages were the targets. The RUF as well as the government forces fighting against the RUF used child soldiers. Amputations and extermination were part of the RUF's everyday campaigns. The rebels were driven by personal enrichment rather than by a political goal or ideology. By the mid 1990s, the RUF controlled the diamond mining areas in the east and with that control they fuelled their revolt with the diamonds, commonly known as conflict or blood diamonds.

The United Nations became involved in Sierra Leone when the signing of the Abidjan Accord, including a ceasefire, took place in late November 1996. The government of Sierra Leone asked the United Nations to come in and help keep the peace. At this time only a few UN officials were dispatched to observe. The UN imposed an oil and arms embargo on Sierra Leone from October 8, 1997-March 10, 1998, but failed to invest more personnel until July1998 when the UN created the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL). Still, only a few hundred were deployed under the UN auspices but were unarmed. At this time again, the UN placed another arms embargo on the RUF.

The signing of the Lomé Agreements in May 1999 was the turning point for the UN's policy in Sierra Leone. Before Lomé the UN had limited involvement. Later that year in October 1999, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) replaced UNOMSIL, and the UN forces snowballed from 1999 until the civil war ended with the 2002 elections. What could have been a major factor in the war was in May 2000 when several hundred UN peacekeepers were taken hostage and killed by the RUF. The UN could have easily pulled out like they did in Rwanda when ten Belgian peacekeepers were killed, but the UN learned a lesson and stayed in there, making the situation less of a mitigating factor in the UN intervention than it could have been.

The United Nations choice to intervene in Sierra Leone so quickly and with so much force, was likely in response to the horrible failure in Rwanda. Sierra Leone did not see too much international attention, which makes it seem that the UN was simply learning from old mistakes. UNAMSIL stayed in Sierra Leone until the end of its mandate in December of 2005, and was succeeded by the United Nations Integrated Office for Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL), which largely observes.

The major triumphs of the United Nations with the Sierra Leone conflict were the speed, collaboration with other governing/peacekeeping bodies and the iniatives outside of the mission in Sierra Leone. The UN did not hesitate to send in more troops when the rebels took over Freetown. Not just once, but twice. A huge improvement from Rwanda, where troops continued to decline as problems became greater. The United Nations decided to work with peacekeeping bodies that did use force, including Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and forces form Britain. Although these groups weren't under the purview of the United Nations, the United Nations viewed them as a necessary element in pushing the RUF out of Freetown and disarming them. The initiatives outside of Sierra Leone included the oil and arms embargo, which served to stave of the RUF insurgencies, and the brokering of the Kimberly Process in Ottawa, Canada, by the world community. The Kimberly Process stopped conflict diamonds from getting into the global market, and with diamonds being the main source of funding for the RUF, the Kimberly Process slowed the rebels' progression.

Another of the main triumphs that I have yet to refer to came after the war. The Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) served to prosecute those who bear greatest responsibility for crimes committed in Sierra Leone from November 1996 when the Abjidan Agreements were signed until the 2002 elections. 11 The government of Sierra Leone asked the UN to help with the prosecutions, while the government mainly worked on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission with little government input. The major human rights crimes of the civil war included, amputations, child soldiers, extermination, and sex crimes, however with the signing of the Lomé Agreements, amnesty was given to the smaller individual crimes, and only the high officials were exempt from this amnesty. About twenty individuals will be prosecuted in the Hague with the SCSL.

The SCSL has primacy over the national courts and does not share information with the government's TRC. This has mixed reception because on the one hand, people won't testify before the TRC if they could possibly be prosecuted for it, but on the other hand, as Elizabeth Evenson says both institutions operate to provide a measure of truth; if these truths conflict in the end, it is unclear what contribution either will have made to the process of transitional justice. 12 The UN also did something different with the courts in that it has a Juvenile chamber where kids would be specified as both victims and defendants.

Also, for the first time in June 2004, there was an exchange between SCSL, ICTY and ICC judges on procedural and substantive matter, including courtroom and case management, elements of crimes, theories of liability, and witness issues. 13 The overall response to the SCSL is positive and according to Human Rights Watch, In a meeting of civil society groups in March 2004, a representative stated, ‘We believe that the SCSL is helping change the views and perceptions of justice in Sierra Leone society in a good, healthy way. 14

The situation in Sierra Leone involving the United Nations largely serves to reconcile the two principles of sovereignty and human rights through its quick turnaround from the Rwanda conflict. Whether this is a complete principle turn around, or just luck, it shows an understanding on the part of the United Nations that the Rwanda effort, although legally acceptable, was not handled in the best legally acceptable way it should have been. The flexibility of these two concepts is one that the United Nations is still testing, as seen in the current Darfur conflict, and seems to flucuate with new each case.

As I have said, the Sierra Leone conflict is one of the best examples of model peacekeeping to date, however there are some things that I would suggest for improvement, regarding Sierra Leone as well as across the spectrum of UN interventions. First, more funding should be allocated to Sierra Leone for the SCSL and national government's TRC. With a lack of funding, it could lead to inefficiency in rendering decisions and unreliable records. The fighting may be over, but if not enough attention and resources are placed on reconciling the nation, there's a very real chance that conflict could happen again in the near future. Also regarding the SCSL, I suggest that efficiency should be key, it took a long time for the appointments of the judges to be handed out, and that only served to slow down justice. Another suggestions would be to hold lesser human rights criminals accountable. Although the Lomé Agreements gave these people amnesty in exchange for a ceasefire, I still find it important to hold these people accountable. The TRC is one way of holding these people socially accountable, but only if the perpetrator comes forward. Perhaps a way of holding these criminals accountable is to sentence them to community service and have the Lomé Agreements' amnesty, represent amnesties from harsher sentences. The most important thing that can be done in Sierra Leone is for the UN to stay in there and insure peace as well as encouraging economic and infrastructure development.

Across the spectrum of UN intervention I believe it is important to create a consistent record of how one could expect the UN to react to human rights abuses. And although the UN moved quicker than usual in Sierra Leone, increased diplomatic measures should be taken earlier on in the conflicts, rather than waiting for them to explode, and so that the UN must immediately resort to peacekeeping forces.

The United Nations' action in Sierra Leone is the action that I would like to see on a continuous basis with the UN. It represents an understanding of the need for international human rights interventions at the most liberal use of chapters VI and VII of the UN Charter, but also with those chapters, represents a balance of sovereingty.",0,0,7.36,9.37,18165
Political Science,Report,Undergraduate,The Difficulty With International Law During the War on Terror,"The Bush administration's war on terror has had a significant impact on the international community. This world-wide conflict has pushed the limits of international law and questioned its value. The lack of an agreement on the meaning of the word terrorism is a major reason why problems arise when fighting this global problem. The American Heritage Dictionary defines terrorism as the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. But many questions arise from this definition. For example, how does one differentiate acts of terrorism from acts of war? Why does terrorism occur? Can terrorism ever be acceptable? The vagueness of the word terrorism and other such language in international law lead to different interpretations and therefore disagreement on a standard rule. Many authors have attempted to shed light on this matter by offering their insights on policies of fighting terrorism. Authors Abraham Sofaer and Kenneth Roth highlight the ambiguity of language in international law during the fight against terrorism which leads to the need for international laws and treaties to be revised in order to keep up with the current status quo.

Abraham Sofaer begins his piece, Terrorism and the Law, by discussing different means that a state can utilize while dealing with terrorism. There are diplomatic means and military means, but he focuses on the use of law. This is due to the fact that Americans are particularly attracted to the law as a means for repressing violence, and are committed domestically and internationally to using law to control criminal conduct and to resolve disputes 1. Although using the law is successful when dealing with domestic crime, problems arise when dealing with international terrorism mainly because the world has no international police force or judicial system. The lack of international cooperation is an even greater dilemma.

Terrorism's association to negativity and evil is embedded in the minds of the majority of Americans. But in reality, the acceptance of terror is far more widespread around the world as many nations regard terrorism as a legitimate means of warfare2. Acts of terror may often be justified when they are attributed to injustice and frustration. Sofaer highlights a series of seven United Nations General Assembly resolutions on terrorism and its causes that were passed during the seventies and eighties to illustrate the inability of the international community to settle on a clear meaning of terrorism. There are attempts among radical groups that are responsible for terrorist acts to seek legitimacy by securing a legal status for terrorism that obscures its fundamentally criminal nature3. The extent to which the rules of the Geneva Convention should be applied was heavily debated.

Further disagreement was seen regarding treaties among states that obligate them to extradite to other states persons accused of committing, in those states, the crimes associated with terrorism. The political offense claim is often used as a defense against extradition. The UN Convention Against the Taking of Hostages also redefines some aspects of terrorism to include them under the rules applying to combatants. This ambiguity leads to differences while discussing the use of force against terrorists and their supporting states.

In The Law of War in the War on Terror, Kenneth Roth describes how the actions of the Bush administration during the war on terror have threatened the most basic due rights. In an attempt to rally support for this cause, President George W Bush has stretched the meaning of the word 'war', referring to it in the literal sense as a real war. Therefore, unlike the war on drugs, which uses the term metaphorically, the literal rhetoric allows the Bush administration to give itself the extraordinary powers enjoyed by a wartime government to detain or even kill suspects without trial 4.

Roth also questions the use of war rules during the war on terror. He believes there is not enough explanation of when they should be applied. The International Committee of the Red Cross offers guidelines for determining an armed conflict, but they are more suited to address political conflicts rather than global terrorism. From these guidelines, it becomes unclear whether al Qaeda should be considered an organized criminal operation or a rebellion. The application of these terms to al Qaeda would each result in different consequences while handling the problem.

Roth continues by providing examples of how the Bush administration uses the rules which are in its best interest. The cases of Jose Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri are of interest. They show how different classifications of suspects according to war time or law enforcement rules will be used to provide for the preferred outcome. Washington's use of war rules when law enforcement rules could reasonably be followed when it has taken custody of a series of al Qaeda suspects in countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Thailand is considered to be troubling by Roth. The murky intelligence that drives terrorist investigations often leads to mistakes which cannot be easily corrected if war rules apply, since the government is never obliged to prove a suspect's guilt5.

The author then reminds the readers that the conduct of the United States sets an example for governments around the world. Many other states would be all too eager to find an excuse to eliminate their enemies through war rules6. Therefore, there should be strict criteria that a situation must meet in order for a nation to invoke war rules. Even then, war rules should be used sparingly, especially when local authorities can and are willing to arrest and deliver a suspect to an independent tribunal – regardless of how the tribunal then rules7. This will separate and make clearer distinctions between war rules and law enforcement rules.

There is no doubt that both Sofaer and Roth see problems with the use of international law when fighting terrorism. Both authors believe that the ambiguity of terminology used in law-making creates problems down the road when these laws are applied. Sofaer discusses the international community's inability to decide on actions that are inclusive in terrorism. The final resolution of a series of seven General Assembly resolutions in December of 1985 unequivocally condemned, as criminal, all acts, methods and practices of terrorism. But at the same time, it reaffirmed each people's inalienable right to self-determination, and the legitimacy of struggles against colonial and racist regimes and other forms of alien domination8. It was a sign that many states still believed that wars of national liberation justified or excused terrorist acts.

Meanwhile, Roth is critical of the lack of guidelines for the use of war rules versus law enforcement rules. He uses the case of the six Algerian men arrested in Bosnia to show how precarious this situation is. The United States government initially followed law-enforcement rules and secured the men's arrest. After a three-month investigation, Bosnia's Supreme Court ordered the suspects released for lack of evidence. Instead of providing additional evidence, however, Washington simply switched to war rules and pressured the Bosnian government to hand the men over to indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay9.

The ideals of Sofaer and Roth are different in that the former criticizes the law itself while the latter focuses on the abuse of the laws that are in place while fighting terrorism. Sofaer argues that the law is not presently being used to counter terrorism. He even says that it has been placed very much at the service of those who embrace political violence. A resolution condemning the United States in 1985 for bombing raids in Libya in retaliation to an attack in Rome and Vienna which killed five Americans would have given state-sponsored terrorism its ultimate legal defense, immunizing international aggression against noncombatants from the use of force in self defense, had it not been vetoed10. This proves worrisome for Sofaer as he calls for a change in the issues that international law is designed to serve.

John Yoo and Robert Delahunty of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research would relate to Sofaer's stance considering their article, Rewriting the Laws of War for a New Enemy. The authors believe that the Geneva Convention will become increasingly obsolete because it makes little sense when applied to a terrorist group or a pseudo-state11. This is evident in their defense of attorney general Alberto Gonzales in response to accusations by his critics that he opened the door to the abuse of Al Qaeda, Afghan, and Iraqi prisoners. The Geneva Convention rules should not apply to terrorists since they thrive on killing civilians and have nothing riding on the humane treatment of American prisoners. Similarly to Sofaer, these authors believe that today's international laws are not fit to provide successful results during the fight against terrorism.

On the other hand, Roth condemns the abuse of international law by states, specifically the United States. He is troubled by Washington's excessive use of war rules to serve its interest. In response, Roth comes up with a three-part test for states to determine if war rules should apply to a situation. First, an organized group must be directing repeated acts of violence against a state, its citizens, or its interests with sufficient intensity that it be fairly recognized as an armed conflict. Second, the suspect must be an active member of an opposing armed force or must be an active participant in the violence. Third, law enforcement means must not be available12. This will limit the use of war rules to situations that it is necessary for. It also puts greater significance on law enforcement rules. Unlike Sofaer, Roth believes that the laws in place are appropriate and should be followed.

Washington Post staff writers Charles Babington and Michael Abramowitz show similar views to Roth in their article U.S. Shifts Policy on Geneva Conventions. They outline a recent Supreme Court decision which overturned the Bush administration's policy that the Geneva Conventions did not apply by law to terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba or in U.S. military custody elsewhere13. It is considered a triumph that these suspects, some who might be innocent civilians mistakenly swept up in U.S. military raids, may now be brought to trial. In accordance with Roth, these authors want to see the United States better adhere to existing rules of international law during the fight against terrorism.

The position of Kenneth Roth in The Law of War in the War on Terror is especially interesting as he offers a realistic view on the issue. Existing international agreements such as the Geneva Convention rules were developed for a reason. The United States is arguably the most powerful nation in the world. With this title comes responsibility of setting an example for governments around the world. If the U.S. does not follow the Geneva Conventions, then these rules may as well be of no use. The decisions of powerful nations often influence the decisions of other nations. For example, as Roth stated, other states would be eager to find an excuse to eliminate their enemies through war rules if the United States' excessive use of war rules continued. Israel has already used this rationale to justify its assassination of terrorist suspects in Gaza and the West Bank, but it is not difficult to imagine Russia doing the same to Chechen leaders in Europe, Turkey using a similar pretext against Kurds in Iraq, China against Uighurs in Central Asia, or Egypt against Islamists at home14. American interests may even be hurt because of other nations using this policy.

To provide world-wide stability, it is best if the powerful nations follow the laws that have been agreed upon. If these laws are no longer effective, states should agree to discuss and provide amendments to them. For example, conventional state-to-state warfare is becoming less common due to the rise of terrorism and guerilla warfare. This was seen with Israel's clash with Hezbollah in Lebanon during the summer of 2006. The constitutions of many states are constantly being revised because of changing circumstances. Therefore, it would also be smart to adjust the Geneva Conventions and United Nations resolutions to match the current norm. Those who have ratified the Geneva Convention rules and any other states which are interested should assemble perhaps under the supervision of the United Nations. These states should work to assess the new and dissimilar conflicts that arise in the present day. Amendments can then be made to certain rules which are deemed outdated with a majority vote. For example, new and clearly defined vocabulary should be added to reflect the new types of warfare which are seen today. At the same time, parts of the text which no longer apply can be removed. The process of amending a constitution in the congress or parliament of a state can be used as a template. These changes will prevent states from using loopholes around certain laws to do what they want. These loopholes are often what make international laws and treaties ineffective. The laws become more legitimate if they are updated and well-defined, and they will be better suited to fulfill their purpose.

It is also interesting to note how the language that is used in international law can be problematic. One does not think of the different interpretations and exclusivity of words such as war and terrorism in every day life, but it is necessary to provide solid and exact definitions for vague terminology if positive results are desired. An ideal situation would be if all states could agree on precise terminology for multi-lateral treaties and other agreements. It could then be known when the determined law applies to a certain situation or not. But in reality, this seems highly improbable. One can see problems arising just by considering the number of nations involved in these decision processes. It becomes increasingly difficult to agree on a specific decision when more parties are involved. This is because each state will have its own unique interests which it would like to adhere to. During the cold war, it was impossible for the United States and the Soviet Union to come to a shared agreement on any question brought forth in the United Nations Security Council.

The use of international law in the fight against terrorism has proved controversial in most cases. Abraham Sofaer and Kenneth Roth have exposed problems in two different areas, the laws themselves and the adherence to them. Some of these laws are outdated and have lost touch with the status quo. This difficulty is seen with the sharp divide among the supporters and opponents of the Bush administration's policies during the war on terror. This is an example of the broad implications that this international problem has, in this case affecting domestic issues in the United States. Without a solid international consensus for clear-cut agreements, the importance of international laws will remain diminish and additional conflict will arise.",80.83,26.7,8.06,12.7,15470
Political Science,Research Paper,Undergraduate,Electoral Reform and Political Parties Within Indonesia,"Following President Suharto's resignation in 1998, the electoral reforms passed into law on January 28, 1999 shaped Indonesia's first democratic election in almost fifty years. Under Suharto's repressive rule, five general elections were held between 1977 and 1997, with only three political parties allowed to participate: Golkar, PPP, and PDI (King, The 1999 Electoral Reforms 90). These elections were designed to present a façade of legitimacy for Suharto's government; they were neither free nor fair. Under Suharto's corrupt New Order government, Indonesians were deprived of their rights and effectively excluded from the political process. Although Suharto held regular elections in order to portray a false image of democracy, he refused to submit to direct election and forbid the organization of opposition parties in rural areas, where most voters were located. Instead, Suharto's term was extended by an electoral college whose members he had individually appointed to ensure his continued power (Case 9). In view of Indonesia's long history of authoritarian control, the 1999 elections signified its tentative transition to democracy. The legitimacy and quality of Indonesia's emerging democracy heavily depended upon the electoral system, rules, and institutions developed by these electoral reforms. To break away from its corrupt and tyrannical past, the first free and fair elections to occur in over 50 years carried significant consequences for Indonesia, ultimately determining which leader would be chosen to guide its course towards individual liberties and freedom of democratic rule.

In contrast to Suharto's corrupt government-controlled electoral college, the existence of an independent body to preside over elections suggested greater legitimacy for the results. How did the establishment of an Independent Election Commission during Indonesia's 1999 electoral reform influence the number of political parties within Indonesia? This is an important question to examine because the number of political parties can affect levels of vote segmentation, ability to produce an effective leader, and political fragmentation within the country. Since Indonesia's Independent Electoral Commission carried the responsibility of administering elections, which was previously a task controlled by the government, this body held the ability to greatly shape the breadth of political parties competing. In transition governments, such as Indonesia's, the quantity of political parties is of great importance for the emerging government's stability and quality, as well as the degree of representation for the median voter's preferences.

According to Paige Johnson in Anti-party Reaction in Indonesia: Causes and Implications, Indonesia's Independent Election Commission, now known as the KPU, was formed as a key electoral reform in 1999 as a specific reaction to the government's manipulation of elections during Suharto's ruling years (485). The Independent Election Commission was conceived in order to plan and oversee the execution of the elections, collect data on results of the election, and determine the number of seats won by each party (King, Half-Hearted Reform 54). It was composed of five government officials and one individual from each of the parties qualifying to participate in the election. In order to qualify for participation, parties had to have an organization established in one-third of the provinces and half of the districts in each of those provinces (King, Half-Hearted Reform 51). The presence of party representatives on the commission was designed to prevent the former government-backed party, Golkar, from using the election administration to declare its own party as the winner.

While more than 200 parties requested to compete in the 1999 elections, the Independent Election Commission determined that only 48 met the qualifications for participation (Evans 136). The Commission's resulting 48 parties were significantly greater in number than the previous three designated eligible to compete, supporting my initial hypothesis that the number of participating parties would drastically increase. However, with such a large number of parties competing for seats, the Independent Electoral Commission reached an impractical size of 53 members. An additional component of the electoral reforms required political parties to obtain two percent of the seats in the national legislature in order to participate in subsequent elections. As a result, when 42 of the 200 parties did not meet this threshold, they were plunged into lame-duck status according to Dwight King in Half-Hearted Reform: Electoral Institutions and the Struggle for Democracy in Indonesia (210). This caused the commission to break into factions and led to a deadlock over the certification of the election results. According to Hermawan Sulistyo in Electoral Politics in Indonesia: A Hard Way to Democracy, the election results were required by the Law on Elections to be endorsed and signed by at least 75 percent of the competing parties, or 36 of the 48 parties competing in the 1999 elections (82). When the parties that failed to meet the two percent threshold refused to endorse the final results, acting President B.J. Habibie signed a presidential decree recognizing the outcome.

Literature Review
Despite the domineering influence of the Independent Electoral Commission on the number of political parties in Indonesia, there are theories presenting other institutional variables as the cause for such a large number of parties. According to William Clark and Matt Golder, Duverger's theory states that more permissive electoral systems, such as proportional representation, produce more political parties (681). However, Clark and Golder argue that Duverger's views are not solely focused on institutional factors, but take into account societal influences as well. Duverger believes political parties are a reflection of social forces, with greater social forces leading to the multiplication of parties, depending upon the degree of constraint applied by electoral institutions (Clark and Golder 681). The degree to which party systems reflect existing social cleavages depends upon the type of electoral institution. Permissive electoral systems, such as proportional representation, producing a large number of parties when levels of social heterogeneity are high (Clark and Golder 683). Given that Indonesia is an ethnically and regionally diverse archipelago, this theory may appear attractive for explaining the large number of political parties. However, Indonesia has a mixed electoral system, dubbed PR Plus, allocating 76% of the seats in the legislature to single-seat districts according to the plurality principle and distributing the remaining 24% of the seats according to proportional representation (King 56). Therefore, while Indonesia is a very heterogeneous country, its electoral system is only partially designed as proportional representation, and therefore this theory cannot fully be applied to its specific case.

In addition to competing theories attributing the quantity of political parties to other institutional factors, the influence of further electoral reforms must also be taken into consideration. Other aspects of the electoral reform package, such as the requirements that parties must have an organization in one-third of the provinces and half of the districts in each of those provinces, certification of non-involvement in leftist organizations, and an ideology that did not conflict with the national philosophy of Pancasila influenced the number of political parties participating in the 1999 elections. These reforms eliminated narrow ethnic or religious parties, promoted parties with mass-based organizational structures, prevented leftist orientation from gaining any representation, and ensured that the national ideology was upheld. These reforms not only limited the number of political parties eligible to compete in the 1999 election, but also ensured that Indonesia's democratic transition did not cause the country to stray from its past.

Research Design and Method
In order to analyze the influence of Indonesia's Independent Electoral Commission on the number of political parties within the country, I will examine the quantity of political parties participating in elections over the course of the past four decades, which will reveal any change following the 1997 Electoral Reforms. In addition, I will assess the change in inter-party competition following the establishment of the Independent Electoral Commission by studying the number of political parties participating during the elections of 1971, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2004. To determine the degree to which smaller minority parties gained representation following the 1997 reforms, I will consider the participation of such parties in the subsequent election as compared to their inclusion in previous elections. Inter-party competition will also be explored in an effort to better understand the degree to which the 1997 Electoral Reforms increased competitiveness within the government in comparison to the authoritarian-style pseudo-democracy and its lack of true opposition.

To address the effects of the electoral reform, political parties will be defined as those competing in elections. I hypothesize that the establishment of an Independent Electoral Commission will result in a dramatic expansion of the number of political parties competing for seats within Indonesia's government. Due to decades of profound censorship by the military-controlled government, a vast array of groups will strive for representation of their interests. Previously, political parties served the sole purpose of establishing legitimacy for Suharto's power. By maintaining frequent elections, the government provided a limited sense of public access and participation in the political process. However, the establishment of an independent body, rather than a government-run electoral college, would guarantee the inclusion of parties beyond the previous government-sanctioned three. With the world watching to see how Indonesia handles this opportunity for transition, the Independent Election Commission holds the responsibility of establishing free and fair elections and proving that Indonesia deserves to be regarded as a legitimate democracy rather than a falsely depicted one. The establishment of an independent body to oversee the 1999 election addresses the greatest flaw of Suharto's government: the lack of an arena of contestation sufficiently fair that the ruling party can be turned out of power (King, Half-Hearted Reform 5). Instead of simply allowing a select few parties to compete under a fixed election, the Commission provides a neutral electoral institution to prevent such government manipulation.

I hypothesize that the creation of an Independent Election Commission will increase inter-party competition. Given that electoral contest will be opened to all parties who wish to request to compete, it would follow that the level of competition between parties would increase as well. With more parties eligible for inclusion in the election, the competition to gain a seat will become tighter. The great importance of this election also influences the political aspirations of parties who wish to gain power within the government during such a significant period of Indonesia's history. An independent body such as the Commission will no longer prevent competition within political parties, as had occurred under Suharto's regime, but will instead encourage a healthy level of contest indicative of a democratic electoral system. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the Independent Election Commission will result in greater representation for smaller, minority parties. Such parties were previously forbidden from competing under Suharto's rule, essentially neglecting the interests of ethnic minorities within the country. With the expansion of electoral participation under the new rules of inclusion, smaller political parties will have a newfound opportunity to compete for the representation of minority interests. The Commission's impartiality will apply rules equally to all parties wishing to compete, allowing those who meet the qualifications to participate, regardless of size or ethnic membership.

Data Analysis
Table 1.0

Results of Indonesian Elections, 1971-2004 (In Percentages)

Table here
As evidenced by Table 1.0, the number of political parties participating in elections from 1971-1997 remained stagnant at three parties, while the number expanded to eight parties receiving at least one percent of the vote in the 1999 elections and thirteen parties gaining one percent or more of the vote during the 2004 elections (Suryadinata 32). This dramatic increase in political parties competing in the elections following the electoral reforms of 1997 affirms the hypothesis that the establishment of an Independent Election Commission would result in a greater number of parties. Despite the fact that the three parties permitted to participate in elections from 1955 to 1997 remain active during the 1999 and 2004 elections, they receive competition in the form of additional parties. The Independent Election Commission took control of party inclusion and participation out of the government's hands, enabling more parties to compete in subsequent elections.

The Independent Election Commission may have successfully enabled more parties to compete in the election, but it failed to account for the high levels of inter-party competition that would unavoidably result. According to Shaheen Mozaffar and Andreas Schedler in The Comparative Study of Electoral Governance, high levels of distrust between parties in democratizing countries motivates them to create an independent election-management body (17). During a country's transitional regime, opposition parties are particularly suspicious of the electoral process due to the government's former manipulation of electoral structures and processes (Mozaffar and Schedler 9). Therefore, election authorities must ensure that their political neutrality is widely accepted in order to ensure an effective transition. However, the structure of the party system also affects the decision to establish an electoral commission. Within a two-party system, political parties are more likely to choose to relinquish their powers of electoral governance to an independent commission, which allows them to share power while retaining the right to veto. In a more fragmented multiparty system, political parties tend to choose a multiparty commission instead in order to retain a level of control (Mozaffar and Schedler 17).

When governments choose to arrange a multiparty commission to manage their elections, some parties may form exclusionary alliances against others (Mozaffar and Schedler 17). This occurred under the Independent Election Commission in Indonesia when it became apparent that most seats would be concentrated among the top six or seven parties. Thirty-one of the 48 total parties refused to sign off on the election results, preventing the commission from receiving the two-thirds majority needed to certify the election (King, Half-Hearted Reform 87). According to King, the party representatives were effectively overturning the decisions of their colleagues to verify the results (Half-Hearted Reform 87). In addition, several representatives for the small parties also demanded legislative seats for all parties that had participated in the elections, regardless of how many votes they had acquired, citing the defense that they had helped successfully administer the elections and did not have sufficient time to prepare for their campaigns following Suharto's resignation (Johnson 488). This request was not granted, however, and these small parties abused their positions in the Independent Election Commission by uniting in an effort to block the Commission's decision and buy themselves time to obtain seats through corrupt measures (King, Half-Hearted Reform 77). This evidence supports my second hypothesis that the establishment of an Independent Electoral Commission would result in increased inter-party competition. Thirty-one of the smaller political parties that failed to obtain a sufficient number of votes manipulated their positions on the Commission in an effort to secure seats in the legislature from parties that had received more votes. Competition for seats was extremely high, with only six parties receiving a sufficient amount of votes to meet the 2% threshold required to compete in the next election and only 21 parties receiving a seat (King, Half-Hearted Reform 77). Since this election occurred during Indonesia's influential transition from an authoritarian regime to a democratic government, the level of distrust between parties was particularly high. In addition, parties were accustomed to governmental manipulation and were willing to resort to corrupt measures in order to secure a position for their party in the legislature.

In order to test my third hypothesis, which speculates that the establishment of an Independent Election Commission will result in greater representation for smaller, minority political parties, I must first examine the preceding election of 1997. Under Suharto's regime, the predetermined three parties were given permission to participate: the United Development Party (PPP), the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), and the government-backed Golkar. Since the two opposing parties were participants merely to present an image of electoral competition and legitimacy for Suharto's regime following Golkar's fixed victory, PPP received 22.4% of the total votes and PDI only received 3%, leaving Golkar the majority of votes with 74.5% in the 1997 election, as evidenced in Table 1.0 (Suryadinata 32). Smaller parties had no opportunity to compete in this election, let alone obtain representation. During the 1999 election, 21 political parties may have won seats, but the top five parties accounted for 90% of the votes and therefore almost all of the 462 seats in the House of Representatives (King, Half-Hearted Reform 207). PDI-P received 33.7% of the votes, Golkar obtained 22.4%, PKB acquired 12.6%, PPP gained 10.7%, and PAN won 7.1% (King, Half-Hearted Reform 78). In total, these five parties obtained 416 of the 462 seats in the House, leaving parties that each acquired less than 1% of the vote with less than 10 seats each and 10 parties with only one seat. Despite the electoral reform, the three parties which were formerly the only electoral participants still received 66.8% of the votes and 331 of the seats, leaving the lesser parties susceptible to their majority control in the legislature.

The lack of representation for smaller parties can be traced to the electoral restrictions enforced by the Independent Election Commission. In order to qualify to compete, parties had to have an organization established in one-third or nine of the provinces and half of the districts in each of those provinces in an effort to exclude ethnically and regionally based parties (King, Half-Hearted Reform 51). Suharto's government had restricted participants to three political parties, but these reforms now limited on the basis of insufficient geographical coverage and depth or penetration of their organizations (King, Half-Hearted Reform 51). This data disproves my third hypothesis, revealing that minority interests continued to be overlooked and smaller parties were unable to gain enough votes to contend with the top five winning parties. For instance, the ethnic Chinese party PBI was eligible to compete in the 1999 election, although it only captured 0.34 percent of the Indonesian vote, securing a single seat (Suryadinata 132). This may be due to confounding variables, however, such as fear of voting for an indigenous political party. Within Indonesian society, ethnic Chinese were often victims of ethnic violence, causing them to stray from political participation as a defense strategy. According to a survey conducted by the Indonesian weekly news magazine Tempo, many Chinese were still afraid to express their political views in 1999 (Suryadinata 127). Nevertheless, smaller parties fortunate enough to gain a single seat in the legislature, such as the PBI, would be incapable of advancing any of their interests when met with the larger parties that dominated the House of Representatives.

However, while each of these requirements did limit and curtail the number of parties participating in Indonesia's elections, the institution of the Independent Election Commission carried out these electoral rules and limitations. Initially designed to prevent the government from intervening in the election's outcome, the Independent Election Commission ultimately failed to perform its obligations to ensure a truly free and fair election as necessary for qualification as a truly democratic nation. Its expansive, largely undefined and misused powers allowed each party to overstep and manipulate its boundaries. As evidenced by the formation of a coalition of 38 parties refusing to recognize the election results, this institutional body was corrupt and far from independent. In its final report, the central supervisory committee of the Independent Election Commission charged the body with overreach and abuse of its authority, stating that the commission allowed parties greater authority than the law allowed in determining their elected candidates (King, Half-Hearted Reform 87).

According to Larry Diamond in The Global State of Democracy, for a country to be considered a liberal democracy, a truly independent electoral commission must first exist to ensure the possible removal of corrupt elected officials from office through frequent, free and fair elections (418). Truly free and fair elections are one of the greatest indicators of a democratic government, revealing the power of the public to hold its representatives accountable and restrain their authority. In emerging democracies, the role of an independent electoral commission is particularly vital to the legitimacy of the subsequent government. Electoral governance in such transitional regimes must balance administrative efficiency, political neutrality, and public accountability (Mozaffar and Schedler 8). Credibility of electoral results can be attained when electoral rules and institutions meet each of these challenges. Within electoral governance, the level of rule application is most susceptible to errors due to the magnitude and complexity of tasks and the authorized discretion of officials involved while accomplishing such tasks (Mozaffar and Schedler 9). During Indonesia's 1999 election, whenever new electoral procedures were ambiguous or poorly understood, members of the Independent Election Commission tended to resort to old operating procedures, contributing to the relatively high incidence of procedural violations (King, Half-Hearted Reform 86). Although thousands of violations of election laws and regulations were documented, international and domestic election monitors agreed that the 1999 election was the freest and fairest election since 1955 (King, Half-Hearted Reform 77).

Conclusion
The results of this research indicate that the establishment of an Independent Election Commission helped to bring a higher degree of legitimacy to the election's results than had been achieved under Suharto's regime. Although the Commission was not without flaws, it is expected that the first elections to occur following the fall of an authoritarian government will contain a degree of attempted manipulation on the part of participants. The Commission did allow the expansion of electoral participation to encompass a greater number of political parties, although competition among participating parties increased as well and minority interests were not represented to a greater degree than before. Continued research is necessary to further assess the role of electoral governance in relation to political parties within emerging democracies. According to a growing compilation of evidence, ineffective electoral governance is an important cause of many flawed elections that have occurred in transitional regimes within the last three decades (Mozaffar and Schedler 6). However, electoral governance has been largely overlooked as an influential variable of democratization in political research (Mozaffar and Schedler 6). The importance of electoral institutions that enforce the rules, carry out the elections, and determine the allocation of seats among parties should not be discredited as inconsequential. Electoral results are due to party systems, political participants, individual campaigns, and voter turnout, but electoral governance plays a greater role than is typically acknowledged.

In addition to indicating the need for additional research regarding the role of electoral commissions, this research reveals the influence of social, economic and political variables that affect the process, outcome, and legitimacy of elections. The institutional changes and electoral rules established in Indonesia by the 1999 electoral reforms contain restrictions; they cannot reverse the damage that decades of authoritarian rule have inflicted upon the integrity and strength of elected representatives. Factors outside the limitations of an electoral institution such as the Independent Election Commission also affect the number of political parties, levels of inter-party competition, and degree of minority representation. Establishing an Independent Election Commission in an effort to ensure the neutrality and legitimacy of electoral results will not yield the preferred outcome of increased legitimacy for Indonesia's government without taking into consideration the factor of human error. Individuals working as members of the Commission do so as agents of its authority, but institutional regulations cannot compensate for their corrupt ambitions of personal advancement. This research indicates the large degree of uncertainty, even within electoral rules and institutions, which cannot be controlled in an effort to democratize a nation. Rather than seeking to contain unexpected circumstances, electoral bodies and the laws they enforce must instead account for such factors in advance in order to avoid the breakdown of well-intended establishments, as occurred in the case of Indonesia's Independent Election Commission.",59.1,27.78,8.18,12.06,26610
Political Science,Research Paper,Undergraduate,The Daily Show Indecision 2004: The Republican Voice versus the Democratic Breadth,"We Americans didn't want to know, and you had the courtesy not to try to find out. Those were good times, as far as we knew. But, listen, let's review the rules. Here's how it works. The President makes the decisions, he's the decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Put them through a spell check and go home. Get to know your family again. Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration. You know, fiction.- Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner, April 2006.

Over the past years, the media has been accused of having a liberal bias. The Daily Show faces the brunt of the criticism with their fake news program that highlights liberal ideas and openly criticizes policies of the Bush administration. In 2004, the Daily Show created its own series to cover the presidential race entitled Indecision 2004. The Democrat and Republican Conventions were each covered in four consecutive episodes in July and September. Assuming that the liberal bias of the Daily Show helped filter the content shown during convention coverage, it could be inferred that the Democrats were covered more favorably than the Republicans. However, when isolating and analyzing the convention coverage from the DNC and RNC, the Daily Show's coverage better highlights Republican ideals and message.

The DNC was covered from July 27 to the 30th with the series title featuring the Democrat's Race to the White House. The RNC was taped later from August 31st to September 3rd, and was entitled Target New York. Each series contained four episodes covering convention highlights and in-house interviews with John Stewart. By analyzing the sound and image bites of the convention coverage, the noted strength of the Republican party to speak in one voice was clearly shown. This study provides an analysis of the speakers shown, topics covered, and subsequent commentary. While the clips of Republicans focus on topics related to the war in Iraq, homeland security, and Bush's promise to keep America safer, the clips of the Democrats fail to produce a unifying theme and message.

Literature Review:
The potential effect of the Daily Show's coverage to influence viewers has been studied in the past years through the presentation of sound and image bites. Scheuer and others agree that television is the dominant medium of a media-dominated age and effective because it manipulates our emotions, numbs us with stereotypes, saturates us with the trivial and the superficial (1; 6). Scheuer also notes how simplicity drives the television message and because of this language (sound bites), television favors certain political ideas and disfavors others. The electronic culture fragments information into isolated, dramatic particles and resists longer, more complex messages (10). Liberal ideas are then naturally challenged, as they appear more complex and progressive. Simplicity, I will suggest, is epitomically conservative, whereas complexity is quintessentially progressive (Scheuer, 10).

The existence of televised political coverage then enables journalists and commentators to transmit messages to the common public. They are able to take events and sound bites and treat them as raw material to be taken apart, combined with other sounds and images, and reintegrated into a new narrative (Hallin, 9-10). The Daily Show adds a humorous component to its reporting of political news, which diminishes the distance between the viewer and the situations being reported on. Humor can enable people to confront authority, to diminish it, to reduce its distance and majesty, thereby revealing authority holders as imperfect mortals, error-prone humans, ordinary people unworthy of special respect, deference and continuation in office (Paletz, 8). Hallin went farther to note the feeling of public efficacy derived from political commentary. Often it was extremely interesting…to hear a politician, or even once in awhile a community leader or ordinary voter, speak an entire paragraph. We had a feeling of understanding something of the person's character and the logic of his or her argument that a 10 second sound bite can never provide. One also had a feeling of being able to judge for oneself (Hallin, 19). Bucy and Grabe also emphasized the importance of image bites because nonverbal emotional displays of leaders can serve as a potent vehicle for expression (659). The study of these sound and image bites in political news coverage, even the fake news of the Daily Show enables valid conclusions to be drawn about the effect of potential communications on the electorate.

Method of Content Analysis:
The goal of the analysis was to find a way to distinguish the content of the Democratic and Republican coverage in a way that was measurable. The best method to do this was to pick out direct points of reference that would occur frequently in coverage of both conventions. The compiled coding sheets are available for reference in the appendix of this paper.

The first thing coded for was the ways to define Democrats and Republicans in the episodes and who made those statements. Examples of this included the Daily Show's opening segment, which defined the Democratic Convention as featuring black people, trial lawyers…celebrities who believe in their hearts that they're helping but really aren't. The coded definitions were only those that meant to apply to the party as a whole and not individual people or the nominees. By noting only the generalizations for the party, conclusions can be drawn about a party as a whole, rather than one representative of it.

There was also a distinction made between references to the party rather than the convention. The coding sheet marked references to the Democratic National Convention and Republican National convention. The messages coded in this section noted the themes presented at the convention and general remarks made by commentators about the event. The intent of marking down the ways in which the parties and convention were defined was to note the differences not only between the parties themselves, but the ways in which the opposition party was referenced by the other.

The third point of analysis for the convention coverage was the references to the nominated candidates, John Kerry and George W. Bush. This type of analysis provides insight to how the opposition party defines the other candidate while also presenting their own. The main point of a convention is to introduce a Presidential candidate to the nation and so the ways they are defined are crucial.

In addition to noting references made to specific candidates and parties, the coding sheet accounted for blatant attacks made by one party on the other, and in some cases, attacks made by one party on itself. Attacks were only marked when one person made a direct reference to a party with a subsequent statement or negative tone. The attacks were labeled as issue or character based. The reason for making this distinction is to note whether there was a significant difference in the type of partisan attacks.

The speaker clips shown in the convention coverage represent the party's message. The coding sheet included the clip of every speaker who was not a correspondent for the Daily Show at each respective convention. The coding for each speaker included their title, talking point, length of time shown in the clip and the context in which they were shown. The context varied in three mediums: either a collection of video clips chosen by the Daily Show, a speech on the convention floor, or an interview in the Daily Show's studio. All of the time measurements were taken in seconds to be able to make comparisons more accurate.

The last two things coded for were the actual length of sound and image bite coverage of the two conventions. Sound bites were only measured when someone who represented the convention, not the Daily Show's representative, was heard. Image bites were taken when a person was shown, but not heard. The measurements do not overlap and adding them would denote the entire length of time the convention was covered for both parties. Sound and image bites of the convention do not include the studio interviews by Stewart or commentary from the Daily Show correspondents. The intent of this analysis is to show that the message from the clips of actual convention coverage and subsequent commentary from direct party and Daily Show representatives themselves produce a message that can then be interpreted by a viewer.

Results:
The results of the content analysis show that there is a more unified message delivered by the Republicans through the Daily Show's convention coverage. The first two references coded for were ways to define the parties and the conventions generally. This analysis was more focused on the rhetoric used by both the parties. In both series of convention coverage, the terms to define Republicans and Democrats came from the Daily Show correspondents and other media figureheads. Every episode in the Race to the White House series opened with an announcer proclaiming the convention featured black people, trial lawyers, unifying anger, organized labor, godless sodomites, and abortion for everybody,… A serious tone was not associated with the message, but the viewer is introduced to Democratic coverage by their stereotypes. Furthermore, when Stewart is talking about the theme delivered by the Democrats, he mockingly insinuates that they are laying it on too thick. The viewers are encouraged to view the clips as very rhetorical, so they would possibly then analyze the speeches from a more critical perspective. The statements made generalizing Republicans were much more directed and offensive. Stewart himself made these comments when generalizing the GOP convention to be a lot of white men. Stephen Colbert also criticized the Republican's management of convention coverage to falsely highlight their small number of minority members, if you're a non-Caucasian Republican, you got yourself a heaping helping of face time.

The commentary on the Republican's relationship with minorities continued when coding the ways in which the two conventions were described. The opponent's convention was mentioned only once during the Republican convention and not at all during the Democrat's. The attack on the Democratic Convention came from Arnold Schwarzenegger when he described it to be as the same as his movie, True Lies. All of the other references to the Democratic convention, with the exception of one made by Gov. Bill Richardson were statements made by Daily Show correspondents. John Stewart called the convention a Dance Party three times and immediately switched to image bites of delegates dancing in their seats. There was no parallel mention of this jovial spirit during the Republican convention. The constant theme of the message describing the Democratic convention was insisting that the event was a farce, a scripted stage managed event, it's not news, it's not even fake news. Stewart went further than Colbert to say that both conventions merely resembled infomercials.

While the commentary for the Democratic convention targeted their energized spirit and mocked the event itself, the Daily Show's commentary for the Republican convention was much more directed towards the Republican character. Steward described the convention atmosphere as a time when Disneyworld closes for gay couples and Colbert reminded the viewers that we're doing the same show tonight – homosexual white men. Five out of the nine mentions by the Daily Show about the Republican convention mentioned homeland security and the Republican theme of a safer and stronger America. Despite what could be viewed as negative commentary, is it tonight that they exploit 9/11 or is tonight empty promises for the future? the constant associations of the Republicans to homeland security issues could also serve to reinforce their talking points.

Figure here
The graph further emphasizes how the Democrats did not make any attacks on the Republican's convention, while the Republicans not only attacked them, but also kept their message about themselves positive.

The following table and charts show the differences in commentary related to the Republican and Democrat nominees.

Table here
Figure here
Figure here
The charts clearly show that the Republicans did not make any attacks on their own candidate, yet the Democrats made three direct attacks on Kerry. Those attacks came from Democratic congressman Zell Miller who spoke at the Republican convention to express his disdain for John Kerry. Miller did not hesitate when describing John Kerry as more wrong, more weak, and more wobbly than any other national figure and proclaiming that Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending. The Daily Show included the clips of Miller's speech and spent several minutes discussing why a Democrat would attack his own party. Miller further emphasized the Republicans' talking points against the Democrats as John McCain questioned whether John Kerry had shot his dog. While the table shows both nominees received an equal number of attacks, none of George W. Bush's attacks came from his own party. The nature of their attacks on John Kerry were about his war record and security issues, while the comments for Bush targeted on his character and intelligence. Joe Biden described how he knows the President doesn't read anything, but I think he watches television. The content analysis showed that while both nominees were described in relation to a war context, the Republican Convention contained more pointed and direct attacks towards John Kerry's record.

The results issues coded for related to the concept of issue ownership amongst the Democrats and Republicans. The coding sheet accounted for the number of positive and negative mentions between certain issues and the different parties.

Table here
Figure here
Table here
Figure here
The most notable result is that the Republicans had 15 positive mentions associated with them and homeland security and only 6 negative comments. The Democrats, in relation, had only 3 positive mentions associated with security issues and 8 negative. The issues of health care and religion were not mentioned negatively for either the Democrats or Republicans. Religion was mentioned positively once for both parties and health care once for the Republicans. Social issues covered topics ranging from abortion to gay marriage. The Republicans and Democrats balanced both their negative and positive associations with social issues so that no party clearly had more significant coverage.

Another main focus of the content analysis was to evaluate the number of speakers clips shown from the convention coverage and evaluate the topics and length of airtime. The graph clearly shows a difference between the sheer volumes of Democratic speaker clips as compared to Republicans.

Figure here
The Democrats' coverage had 25 speakers, while the Republicans had only 14. The following pie charts highlight greater discrepancies between the types of speakers shown for both types of convention coverage.

Figure here
Figure here
Over half of the Democratic speakers shown held some form of public office, while only six of the Republicans did. Seven of the Democrats were related to the President and Vice Presidential nominee and the remaining were media figureheads, such as celebrities, who spoke in support of the Democrats. In contrast, the Republicans had six of their speakers related to their nominee and one from the President's staff. While the number of speakers for those categories may be roughly the same, the Republicans had a smaller number of speakers overall, thus their percentage of speakers directly associated to the President and Vice President was 50%. It is also interesting to note that roughly one-third of the Democrats shown were candidates for the nomination themselves and five of them including Howard Dean, Joe Biden, Joe Lieberman, Wesley Clark, and Al Gore, openly talked about their attempts to run for President. Governor Dean shared stories from the campaign trail for 20 seconds and Former General Wesley Clark shared his war credentials and history for 14 seconds. The stories shared by elected public officials from the Republican convention evoked memories of 9/11 and the war on Iraq. Senator McCain talked about the Iraq War for 20 seconds while Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani referenced September 11, 2001 with a banner with those words in the background. No matter the sound bite shown, viewers would still receive an image of 9/11.

The coding sheets for the Republican and Democratic National Convention also show a difference between the number of in-house interviews Stewart conducted during each series. Stewart interviewed four people during the Republican convention and only two during his coverage of the Democrats. However, two of the interviews during the Republican coverage were with media commentators, Ted Koppel and Chris Matthews. The two other interviews were with Senator McCain and White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett, and they focused almost exclusively on the Republican message and President Bush's handling of the war. The two interviews with Democratic Governor Bill Richardson and Senator Joe Biden covered some of the convention message, but also focused on the official's personal story and their advocacy issues. There was no significant discrepancy between the time each interviewee was allotted during coverage.

The length of time an image or sound bite is shown on television can be significant. The following graph shows that the Republicans were shown more than the Democrats, with 330 seconds devoted to image clips, while the Democrats had only 282.

Figure here
The Democratic sound bites were longer totaling 408 seconds, while the Republicans had 330 seconds. The nominees themselves also received an equal amount of coverage with Kerry receiving 77 seconds of image and sound bites and Bush being heard for 61 seconds with no image clips. The majority of the Republican image bite coverage was pictures of delegates on the floor, while many of the Democratic clips were speakers walking out to the podium on stage. Looking only at the length of actual convention coverage, including video and audio footage of the DNC and RNC, the amount of time was roughly equal for both parties. The Democrats were heard and shown for 13% and the Republicans for 11.8% of the Daily Show's total series coverage for each convention.

Discussion:
It seems slightly farfetched to hypothesize that coverage of the Republican and Democratic National Convention on the Daily Show could provide some advantages for the Republican candidate. Especially in a media environment that is constantly accused of having a liberal bias and favoring progressive ideals. The conclusions drawn above are extrapolated evidence from a small sample size of only eight episodes. The size of the sample could have affected the results because only four episodes are being compared with their four counterparts. The Daily Show is a television show that has been established over years and it seems impractical to make general statements about its content on the basis of eight episodes.

Yet analyzing the content of the sound and image bites of the conventions and their subsequent commentaries show that the Republicans had a more focused and more disciplined message than the Democrats. The number of convention speakers shown for each the Democrats and Republicans support the image of a closed Bush administration. Auletta noted in his article in the New Yorker that what seems new with the Bush White House is the unusual skill that it has shown in keeping much of the press at a distance while controlling the news agenda (4). After studying the communications and public affairs office of the Bush White House, Martha Kumar explained that, Bush has a great focus on the structure of his communications operation – advocating for him is not the same thing as explaining his decisions or actions(15). It is this strength, which shines through the coverage by the Daily Show on the Republican convention. Most of the Republican speakers mentioned the war in Iraq, September 11th, and the ability of George Bush to help make America safer. Most of the Republican speakers were related to or staff for the Bush administration. The administration speaks with one voice and they never get off their talking points (Auletta, 4-5).

The Democrats, by contrast, through this analysis, are presented by their depth. Over half of the convention clips shown by the Daily Show were of previous candidates for the nomination and most of them even talked about their own Presidential ambitions. Senator Barack Obama and Congressman Dennis Kucinich talked about uniting America and the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes America has a place for him too. But those hopes for unity fell short of the coverage offered by the Daily Show. Democrats attacked fellow Democrats and the coverage of Zell Miller's speech at the Republican convention was the highlight of one episode. Not one Republican spoke ill of President Bush, and not once did Democrat Zell Miller speak positively about his own party.

The Daily Show commentary played a strong role in influencing the perception of Democrats and Republicans by the viewers. When referencing the nominating candidate, the Daily Show was responsible for the majority of insults against President Bush. Their video montages echoed Bush's ability to control the media with the headline, George W. Bush: Because He Says So. There is no doubt that reporters see the White House as a fortress (Auletta, 2). The Daily Show introduced John Kerry in their montage to be the alternative choice, Because He's Not George Bush. Despite the clear insult towards the President's authority, the viewers associate the images of John Kerry constantly with George Bush. Kerry and the Democrats are unable to dictate the message.

One possible reason for the inability of the Democrats to control the message is the circumstances surrounding the 2004 campaign. The Republicans were facing a re-election year, so President Bush did not have to go through the vetting stage at the same time as John Kerry. The Democratic convention discussed the trials that took place through the nominating process. Joe Lieberman discussed how there was almost a three way tie for third place. Governor Dean shared stories about his campaign and the Daily Show highlighted his famous scream. Although the chair of the convention, Bill Richardson stated that this convention was a build up to tell the story of Senator John Kerry, the story was lost amongst the breadth of speakers and inner party attacks.

Another subtle influence on the coverage of the two conventions was their locations. The Democratic convention was held in Boston, Senator Kerry's home state. The Daily Show had to stay in travel accommodations and did not have their familiar set available. For the Republican convention, the Daily Show was on its home turf. They had more in studio interviews during their Republican coverage, possibly because more people were available to come onto the show and they had more access to other media commentators in New York like Ted Koppel and Chris Matthews. It is also no coincidence that the Republican National Convention was hosted in New York three years after the attacks on the World Trade Center. The President and other Republicans were able to stand outside the twin towers and further emphasize September 11th as the central focus of their re-election strategy.

This militant focus on message is also shown through the analysis of positive and negative issue associations with the Democrats and Republicans. The Republicans had 15 positive messages associated with them and homeland security. Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke in front of a backdrop of September 11, 2001 that was in bolded white against a black screen. If the Daily Show wanted to clip any of his speech, they would inevitably be fed the image bite of 9/11 regardless of Giuliani's words. In comparison, three issues, which would normally be associated positively with Democrats, social issues, health care and the economy, did not distinguish them more significantly than Republicans. In fact, the Republicans had more positive mentions in relation to social issues than the Democrats. They also had less negative associations with homeland security than the Democrats. The election of 2004 was arguably a referendum on the Bush administration's ability to keep America safer and by noting the message of the Democrats and Republicans in relation to that theory, the Republicans message was more emphasized and thus could be more directly extrapolated upon by the viewers.

Conclusion:
The coverage of the Daily Show's Indecision 2004 highlighted the ability of the Democrats and Republicans to present a message through their respective conventions. Although the Daily Show is known as one of the most liberal television programs on TV, the direct convention coverage showed that the Republicans are more organized, more disciplined, and have a more coherent message. This reflects the strategy of President Bush that was also echoed by a senior official weeks after the Republican convention. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do(Suskind, 2004). The Democrats' attempt to create a coherent message from a nomination field of over seven candidates and the unsure war record of the nominating candidate clearly pales in comparison.

The next question then, is to ask why coverage assumed to be skewed in one direction actually promotes another as a result of its failure to diminish the effects of the Republicans' talking points. It is assumed that journalists can create importance and certify authority as much as reflect it, in deciding who should speak on what subjects under what circumstances (Cook, 87), but that is not reflective in John Stewart's coverage of the conventions. The entire Republican Convention reflected a well-oiled machine of speakers and unflinching support for the current President. It would have been difficult for the Daily Show to find footage of the actual convention that showed otherwise. Chris Matthews of MSNBC produced insight into this phenomenon two years later, after Stephen Colbert gave his speech at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. He proclaimed that the president is our head of state, not just a politician and because of that, is he subject to different rules pertaining to the scrutiny of his campaign strategy and message (Matthews, 2006)? Analysis of the Daily Show's presentation of Indecision 2004 exposes how the Republican voice will effectively and inevitably break through their political coverage.",21.98,11.8,3.6,1.23,27423
Political Science,Research Paper,Undergraduate,"The Politicization of American Healthcare as seen in the Reauthorization of SCHIP and its Effects on the American Public
","Introduction
The issue of health care in America has not always been at the heart of every political debate. In a study conducted during the 2004 Presidential elections, although health care ranked higher in importance among voters than most other domestic issues, it was only fourth in importance in determining their vote for president, with affordability of health care and health care insurance being chosen as the specific health related issues of greatest concern (Blendon, et al. 2004). However, health care has, at certain times, been extremely contentious and highly politicized, bringing it to the forefront of voters' attention. A current prime example would be the bitter partisan debate between the Democrats and Republicans regarding the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), an extremely volatile issue precisely because it concerns the well being of society's most vulnerable – children. SCHIP, which will be discussed in greater detail later, has brought forth a barrage of petty party bickering and accusations of politicization from both sides of the aisle. This has led to much media criticism about the futility of such political theatre and rhetoric in addressing the problem at hand. Thus, what sort of effects has the politicization of health care brought to the American people? Have these disagreements paradoxically brought about more thoroughly analyzed policies and led to pragmatic and optimum compromises or has this political theatre and exaggerated rhetoric only served to impede the improvement of healthcare due to both parties' inability to cooperate and break the deadlock in political ideologies? The link between the variables of politicization of healthcare and its effect on the public will thus be studied with SCHIP as its main case study.

Background
SCHIP was enacted as Title XXI of the Social Security Act by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 primarily to expand insurance coverage to low-income children living in families who earned too much to qualify for Medicaid but were yet unable to afford private insurance. At that time, more than 10 million children lacked health insurance, with about seven million of them living in families with incomes below twice the federal poverty level (FPL). Although 75 percent of those uninsured children lived in a family with at least a parent who had full-time employment, and 90 percent had one parent who was employed either full or part-time, their families were either not provided with job-based health insurance or lacked the finances to buy the insurance offered (Families USA). Thus, Congress appropriated approximately $40 billion to fund the program for 10 years. Although it was optional, within two years of SCHIP's inception, all fifty states had adopted the program to expand coverage for children. Based on steadily rising enrollment in SCHIP, rates of uninsured children from low-income families have declined 2.2 million, from 23 percent in 1997 to 14.4 percent in 2004, and the program is seen as highly successful (Pediatrics). However, in 2006 the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 9.4 million children in the U.S. did not have health coverage - one in eight being uninsured. What this meant was that after six years of improvement in the rate of health coverage for children, the number of uninsured children has again begun increasing. In 2006 alone, although SCHIP was found to provide health insurance coverage to 6.6 million children, there was found to be one million more uninsured children than two years ago (Pediatrics).

This set the stage for SCHIP to become a highly contentious issue and a political hotbed as children have always been perceived as political untouchables. Thus, the reauthorization of SCHIP is a very charged one because it has been a highly popular program that has drawn bipartisan support in the past. In fact, a survey by the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute has also found that nine in ten Americans say the program is important, with support for it crossing party lines (Lake Research Partners). Democrats are in support of the SCHIP reauthorization bill and have championed the fact that the SCHIP bill would cover 10 million children and be completely paid for by the tobacco tax, adding no strain on the federal budget. However, on the other side of the aisle, Republicans have felt that a $35 billion expansion would be too great of an increase and goes too far in federalizing healthcare. (Pediatrics) The inclusion of a tobacco tax, purported claims of covering illegal immigrants, middle-class families and adults, and the possibility of the reauthorization adversely affecting the private insurance market are also the opposing arguments that are most often brought up by the Republican side.

The debate that has taken place in Congress over the course of the past three months is indeed a complicated affair that has seen usual legislative processes thrown out of the window. The reauthorization issue first arose in early August when the House passed the CHAMP Act in a partisan fashion 225 – 204 with primarily Democratic support, in an attempt to renew SCHIP before it expired on September 30, 2007 (Children's Defense Fund). The CHAMP Act would provide health coverage to 4.1 million more uninsured children. Nearly $50 billion would be needed in additional funding over the next five years and will be paid for by a 41-cent increase in the federal tobacco tax and cuts in overpayments to private Medicare plans (Children's Defense Fund). However, the Senate's own Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 (CHIPRA) would expand coverage to another 3.2 million uninsured children and would cost an increase in $35 billion of the federal SCHIP contribution, from $25 billion to $61.4 billion over the next five years. This package is funded by a $1.00 tobacco tax, a 61-cent increase from before. CHIPRA eventually passed 68 – 31 (Children's Defense Fund). President Bush has expressed his opposition to both plans and promised a presidential veto if the bill passed both houses. He proposed increasing funds by a comparatively lesser $4.8 billion over the next five years. In addition, Bush also proposed the highly unpopular move of reducing funding for states that have expanded SCHIP eligibility to children in families with yearly incomes more than 200 percent of the FPL (Pediatrics).

On September 24 this year, after nearly two months of negotiations, the House and Senate finally attained a bipartisan compromise to reauthorize SCHIP for an additional five years and cover 3.1 million more uninsured children. The compromise bill is similar to the Senate's, but includes additional provisions adopted from the House bill. This legislation would cost $35 billion over five years, cover a total of 10 million children, and would be paid entirely by a 61-cent increase in the tobacco tax (Children's Defense Fund). It has also obtained the endorsement from 43 governors, and a wide range of constituencies ranging from AARP, the National Council of State Legislatures and the American Academy of Nursing. In the House, the bill passed 265 -159 - insufficient to override a presidential veto - with 45 Republicans voting with all but eight Democrats in support of it. In the Senate, however, the bill passed veto-proof in a bipartisan manner 67 – 29. However, President Bush followed through with his promised veto, but signs a continuing resolution temporarily funding SCHIP at former levels till November 16, 2007. Thus, even though SCHIP coverage has not ceased, the ideological deadlock has placed the health insurance coverage of the 6.6 million children currently enrolled at risk (Children's Defense Fund).

Following that, the House then won a procedural vote that allowed it to postpone until October 18 2007 a vote to override the veto of the SCHIP legislation. In those two weeks, congressional Democrats and their allies advanced with a paid media and grassroots campaign to pressure Republicans in vulnerable districts to vote for the override. According to CQ Today, the delay was intended to give Democrats and bill supporters time to make a 'no' vote as politically unpalatable as possible for Republicans. (Kaiser Network) Public pressure and the media spotlight continue to mount as a joint survey conducted by NPR, Harvard School of Public Health, and the Kaiser Family Foundation show that 65 percent of Americans support increased funding for SCHIP, even after hearing opponents' arguments against it. On October 18 2007, the House voted 273 – 156 in an unsuccessful attempt to override President Bush's veto of the reauthorization of SCHIP, with 229 Democrats and 44 Republicans voting in favor of the override, just 13 votes shy of the two-third margin needed (Children's Defense Fund). On October 25 2007, the House again successfully passed a revised but weaker CHIPRA bill 265 - 142, again without a veto-proof majority. This bill was essentially the same as the first and would cover 10 million children, but it was altered cosmetically to pacify Republican demands. It would limit coverage to children in families with annual incomes below 300 percent of the FPL, made it less attractive for parents to switch from private to government funded insurance, phased out SCHIP coverage of childless adults within one year, and also required states to apply more thorough citizenship documentation standards to prevent undocumented immigrants from enrolling in the program (Kaiser Network). The Senate followed suit and passed the revised compromise bill as well, this time without a veto-proof majority. Bush again promised to veto the bill if it was sent to his desk and this time went further to state that he would veto any bill that consisted of a tobacco tax increase. Therefore, in order to obtain more time for bipartisan negotiations, Congress passed and President Bush signed another continuing resolution that funded SCHIP at 2007 levels of $5 billion a year through December 14, 2007. After reaching a stalemate in negotiations right before the two week Thanksgiving recess, the SCHIP reauthorization bill was picked up again when Congress resumed on 3 December 2007 (Kaiser Network).

Literature Review
• Definition of terms
For the purpose of this study, we will define politicization according to Dictionary.com, which describes it as the bringing of political character or flavor to, as mainly partisanship – a person with an inclination to favor one group, view or opinion over alternatives. It is a commitment to the incumbency of the ideology of a particular political party. Thus, in this case, the politicization of healthcare would imply that the debate has become mostly a Democrat versus Republican battle, with precedence being given to securing political points and capital rather than focusing on the substantive content of the issue at hand. The specific effects of this form of politicization on the American public that will be analyzed in this study will be the variable of the availability of health care insurance because these have been selected by voters as issues of greatest concern (Klein 2006). The section of the American Public that will be focused upon specifically will be low-income children since SCHIP was created precisely with their well being in mind.

• Politicization of Healthcare in America Throughout History
The debacle over SCHIP is not the first time that America's healthcare has been brought into the fray of partisanship. The Clinton universal health care plan of 1993 was another highly politicized health care reform package proposed by the administration of then President Bill Clinton, and created and chaired by his wife, the First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton (Skocpol 1995). The proposal provided guaranteed insurance coverage for all employees that was to be funded through payroll taxes and provided by tightly regulated, non-profit Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) (Health Economics 2007). The Clinton health care plan was estimated to create 59 new federal programs or bureaucracies, enlarge 20 others, require 79 new federal authorizations, and make substantial changes in the tax code, which critics felt would have only served to further complicate the already inefficient bureaucracy (Skocpol 1995). In line with providing universal healthcare, Clinton's plan also offered the unemployed government subsidies for enrollment into the HMOs (Health Economics 2007). Thus, on Capitol Hill, as political strategizing started kicking into gear, astute right-wing Republicans appreciated the fact that their ideological fortunes within the party itself, as well as the Republican partisan interest in undermining the Democrats as a means to securing control of Congress and the presidency, could be served by first demonizing and then completely crushing the Clinton plan (Skocpol 1995). Skocpol (1995) has found that from 1993 to 1994, hundreds of special interest groups spent more than $100 million collectively to sway the outcome of this particular public policy issue, leading to the Center for Public Integrity calling it the most heavily lobbied legislative initiative in recent US history.

The politicization of this health care initiative also went as far as to prompt Mr. William Kristol of the Project for the Republican Future to distribute a continual stream of private strategy memos urging an all-out partisan warfare in December 1993 (Skocpol 1995). He remarked that an aggressive and uncompromising counterstrategy by the Republicans should ultimately kill, rather than amend the plan. Abolishing the plan without offering amendments was a key priority because of the potential of a Democrat-led universal health care plan to secure crucial middle-class votes and revive the reputation of the party, putting a Republican future in jeopardy (Public Broadcasting Service 1996). The timing of the memo coincided with a mounting private consensus among Republicans that a complete resistance to the Clinton plan was in their best political interest, and they did so by labeling it as a quintessential example of Big Government Democratic liberalism run wild. (Public Broadcasting Service).

President Clinton's had made the assertion of a health care system that is badly broken and revealed his proposal in a widely acclaimed speech to Congress on September 1993. Republicans were thus keenly aware that they had to convince middle-class Americans that was both untrue and inaccurate (Skocpol 1995). Therefore, under the cover of Rush Limbaugh and other conservative right-wing anchors of hundreds of news and talk radio programs that had access to tens of millions of listeners, the Republicans through skillful political strategy and a genuine belief in their ideology promoted their cause by portraying the plan as a bureaucratic triumph by welfare-state liberals (Skocpol 1995).

As increasing partisanship ensued, moderate Republicans who had originally favored reaching a compromise began to recant in the face of anti-reform demands within their own party (Skocpol 1995). Interest groups whose leaders were initially not averse to further negotiations over reforms were soon arm-twisted by their constituents and Republican leaders to draw back from cooperating with the Clinton administration and congressional Democrats (Skocpol 1995). The distinction of party lines was also further exacerbated by the media as it increasingly focused its coverage from the content of the competing health plans under review to the partisan clashes and strategy of the different Congressional groups that were vying for control of the reforms (Bok 1998). Therefore, the inevitable end result was an unbridgeable partisan based schism that played a significant role in the defeat of the Clinton proposal. Amidst the debate, there was no middle ground political compromise that addressed the inefficiencies of the health care system reached (Bok 1998). The creation of SCHIP later in 1997 was thus a milestone event in American social history. Not since Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965 had Congress members worked together to pass a bipartisan bill that endorsed such a large subsidized health insurance program, reducing the number of low-income uninsured children (United States Department of Health and Human Services).

However, partisan politics has not always led to the complete destruction of beneficial initiatives for Americans. In fact, it can be argued that it is precisely such partisanship that promotes healthy democratic debates over issues. With myriad opinions from both sides being contributed through suggested amendments even on the basis of party lines, the final bill can be further refined and improved before it goes to the floor, increasing the probability of it being passed into law. This can be seen in the example of Medicare where in 1995, for the first time in 30 years, a highly public, partisan and ideologically divisive debate occurred (Oberlander 2003). The 1995 Republican Medicare reform bill championed achieving a balanced budget through large cuts in program spending by introducing a political cap on Medicare expenditures (Oberlander 2003). Democrats were opposed to such a change because they believed that this would have led to a shortfall in program finances and crippled the program, thus leading then President Bill Clinton to veto the bill, while congressional Democrats joined in solidarity to criticize the Republican Medicare proposal as abandoning its social contract with the people (Oberlander 2003). However, the 1995 defeat of the bill created the gateway for further political compromises, and finally in 1997, Medicare reforms were passed in a bipartisan manner with the hard cap on Medicare spending that would have activated automatic spending cuts in the program being removed (Oberlander 2003). This was a key concession by the Republicans as Democrats had identified this particular cap as threatening the ability of seniors to access quality medical care and were thus strongly opposed to it (Oberlander 2003). Spending cuts were also less harsh this time around. In hindsight, these political compromises have been recognized as essential in preventing traditional Medicare from being devastated through cuts and restructuring, allowing it to continue serving its target population (Oberlander 2003). Thus in this scenario, we are able to observe how partisan politics might have served the American people.

• Assessment of Healthcare in America
Various assessments of America's current health care system have led to it being called financially inefficient, inaccessible, and administratively wasteful (Matcha 2004). Despite spending more per capita on health care with annual costs exceeding $2 trillion in 2005 - an astounding 16 percent of its GDP - America is not getting a corresponding value for its money. It continues to document higher infant mortality rates, lower life expectancy, and an actual uninsured population of 45 million as of 2005 - a phenomenon virtually non existent in the rest of the industrialized world (Klein 2006; National Coalition of Healthcare). Furthermore, the problem is slated to get worse with American health care spending projected to continue increasing at similar levels for the next decade, reaching $4 trillion in 2015 - a sizable 20 percent of GDP (National Coalition of Healthcare). Currently, California records the largest number of uninsured -18 percent of its residents - with 80 percent of these people being from working families with average incomes (California Teachers' Association). Without the social safety net of health insurance, their illnesses go unchecked until they become emergency concerns, further pushing up the cost of health care (California Teachers' Association). Employers have also borne the brunt of the health care crisis, seeing their insurance premiums rise 87 percent over the last seven years. General Motors now spends more on its employees' health insurance than on its purchase of steel (National Coalition of Healthcare). Clearly, the American health care insurance system is in dire need of a massive overhaul.

In addition, in a recent survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC, those who voiced pessimism about the future were asked to identify the source of their concern. Next to the Iraq war, the inadequacies of the health care system drew the most votes (Inglehart 2007). This comes as no surprise considering the fact that one in four Americans says that his or her family has had a problem paying for medical care during the past year, an increase in 7 percent over the past nine years (National Coalition of Healthcare). A new high of 30 percent has also said that someone in his or her family has deferred medical care in the past year, even when the medical condition was considerably serious (National Coalition of Healthcare). Corroborating these statistics, national surveys have also repeatedly shown that the main reason of non-insurance has been the high cost of health insurance coverage. In fact, since 2006, annual premiums for family coverage have significantly overtaken the gross income of a full-time, minimum-wage employee who takes home $10,712, illuminating the severity of the problem (National Coalition of Healthcare 2005).

Although Medicaid was established with the mission of providing health insurance coverage to the nation's poor, disabled and the destitute elderly people, it is currently facing a funding crisis that has seen several critical health programs reduced or abolished, and program eligibility adjusted (American Dental Association). Similarly, Medicare, which is a health insurance program for those 65 years and older, has also faced similar problems. Evidently, in light of the variables of health care affordability and health care insurance which polled voters valued most, the administration has failed miserably in allaying the fears of the American public.

• The Relationship Between Politicization of Healthcare and its Effects on the Public
Friedman (2000) believes that in health care, there is always the inevitability of politics. She feels that while most other countries have decided on the basic rules of whether health care should consist of universal coverage, be publicly or privately controlled, and the extent of the government's role, America has yet to decide on any of those things. Therefore, partisan politics fills the vacuum and has the potential to be destructive, as witnessed in the partisan wars over Medicare and managed care (Friedman 2000). In her opinion, excessive partisanship would thus result in the two biggest crucial health care issues – an aging society and the rapidly increasing number of uninsured - remaining unaddressed until they reach crisis proportions. This does not bode well for the American people. However, others have maintained that it is exactly this politicization that encourages healthy debate and thus need not be perceived negatively.

Therefore, what has being embroiled in a larger struggle over ideologies meant for the general state of health care in America? Several trains of thoughts exist. From the above analyses, we can see that politicization of healthcare has its pros and cons, either a beneficial enlargement of the democratic debate or a possible stalemate in policy implementation due to excessive party bickering. The issue of SCHIP must thus be further analyzed to determine its effects on health care. My hypothesis is that SCHIP has become a politicized issue and that this has resulted in negative effects on low-income children.

Research Design/ Data Collection
The research design of content analysis was used in evaluating my hypothesis. A total of 33 newspaper articles from the weeks starting 5 September 2007 to 18 November 2007 (11 weeks) were used to determine if politicization of SCHIP was reported and if it was perceived to have been detrimental for low-income children. I had to decide to stop my collation of articles just before Congress went on its Thanksgiving recess because the SCHIP legislative process is an ongoing one. I also chose such forms of publication for content analysis because I feel that it best represents what permeates the public sphere and influences the perception of the people the most. Specifically, congressional newspapers and publications (Roll Call, The Hill, Politico, Congress Daily, Congressional Quarterly) were chosen for analysis as not only are its reporters most attuned to the workings of Congress, they also provide up-to-the-minute news of the daily legislative and political maneuvers that take place on Capitol Hill. However, editorials were left out as I felt that they represented more personal points of view and lacked the objectivity that I felt was essential in conducting a fair content analysis. Thus, out of all the relevant SCHIP related articles collated, three were randomly chosen from each of the 11 weeks that analysis was being conducted upon. A standardized coding sheet (Appendix 1) was then applied to each of them to measure the presence of politicization in the SCHIP issue, the perspective from both sides of the aisle, and also the reported effects on low-income children. The articles were coded by paragraphs with the options in each question of the coding sheet designed to be mutually exclusive so that reliable data could be obtained. Inter-coder reliability was also established in the coding of these articles.

An example of what might be a disputed coding scenario would be the classification of the term erosion in Republican territory in the fight to expand healthcare coverage for children in an article in The Hill on 7 September 2007 titled, House Dems See Political Win on SCHIP. Ambiguity might result from the decision whether to classify it under politicization in the generic party context (Question 1) or in the context of the political standing of an individual Congressman (Question 2). Thus, in such a situation, I have consistently classified this as politicization in the party context. I have done so is because although the term erosion in Republican territory implies that individual Congress members will be adversely affected through the losing of their House seats, the usage of Republican territory exudes a more general collective party feel and thus should be coded as the Republican party as a whole bearing the brunt of the negative ramifications.

Findings
Several interesting findings have surfaced from the content analysis which provides us with an insight into the evidence of politicization of SCHIP and the possible impacts on children from low-income families.

Figure here
* 18 out of the 33 articles analyzed were coded positively for the presence of politicized terms.

First, slightly more than half of the 33 articles were found to contain terms that suggest politicization such as political theatre, scoring political points, or voting along party lines, with 72 percent of these emphasizing it in more than one paragraph. In addition, as seen in the above graph, it was also found that the greatest number of politicization terms used was found in the week from 8 to 14 October 2007. A total of 13 paragraphs with politicized terms were found in the three coded articles of that week, approximately three times the weekly average of 4.5 terms. It is interesting to note that this trend fell during the two-week postponement of the veto override vote in which Democrats and outside lobbying groups cooperated in a media blitz to pressure Republicans who voted against the veto override. Radio ads were broadcast and a new technique of sponsoring traffic and weather updates at local radio stations that allowed the deejay to read the ads rather having them pre-taped was adopted to call into question the Republicans' votes. Thus, predictably, Republicans voiced their displeasure and dismissed the ads as further evidence of Democrats using the children's health issue for political advantage (Kady 2007).

Table 1: Number of Articles and Paragraphs that Fulfill Politicization Criteria

Table here
*A total of 21 articles coded positively for at least one of these 16 categories. 8 of these coded positively for more than one category.

*Numbers indicate total number of articles while those in parentheses represent total number of article paragraphs that fulfill stated criteria.

Sixty-four percent (21 out of 33) of the articles implicitly suggest politicization by stating how the SCHIP process has either inadvertently politically advantaged or disadvantaged the political parties or their respective Congress members (Questions 1 and 2). As seen in the above table, out of the 21 articles that coded positive for these two questions, the option that gathered the most votes at 28 paragraphs mentioned specifically Republicans voting against SCHIP would lead to disadvantageous consequences. Trailing second with eight paragraph mentions was the option stating Democrats voting for SCHIP would lead to advantageous consequences.

Table 2: Democratic and Republican Perspective of the Optimum SCHIP Bill

Table here
*Figures represent the number of articles that mentioned the particular reason while figures in parentheses represent the percentage out of the 33 articles coded that mentioned it.

The table above also illustrates the different perspectives of what each side has defined as optimum. Republicans were opposed to the SCHIP bill for myriad reasons. Some said the SCHIP expansion would cover illegal immigrants, adults and families earning too high of a percentage above the FPL and was a step towards socialized medicine. Others were opposed to the increase in the federal tobacco tax, claimed that it was too expensive of an expansion, and alleged that it would adversely affect the private insurance market. Thus, although Republicans expressed a general support for the SCHIP bill, they felt that this particular bill was flawed and needed to be renegotiated in a bipartisan manner since it would not provide the best health care for children from low-income families – the intended beneficiaries of the program. Content analysis showed the top three reasons, ranked in order, against the SCHIP reauthorization bill as being the disputed areas of coverage for children in families earning too high of a percentage over the FPL, coverage for illegal immigrants and lastly coverage of adults. Thirty-six percent of all coded congressional publications mentioned the first two factors, with one in three of the articles that brought up illegal immigrants demanding specifically for tighter provisions verifying citizenship status. Eighteen percent also mentioned providing health insurance coverage for adults as a shortcoming in the SCHIP bill. These were frequently brought up by Congress members on the House floor during scheduled vote debates.

The Democrats, on the other hand, were mostly supportive of the passage of the SCHIP bill. They repeatedly brought up the fact that the SCHIP bill would cover 10 million children, 3.4 million more than the year before, as their main push for the program. Eighteen percent of all coded articles mentioned this factor as the Democratic rationale for supporting SCHIP. The fact that SCHIP would place no strain on the fiscal budget, since it was going to be paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax, was also another factor mentioned by the Democrats in an attempt to garner support for the program.

Lastly, in the five articles that mentioned the specific effects of the SCHIP debate on children from low-income families, two of these articles reported Republican members suggested an eventual negative effect on uninsured children. They felt that if the bill was passed in its current form without the inclusion of Republican demands such as better citizenship documentation and the immediate exclusion of health insurance coverage for adults, low-income children will not be able to reap the full benefits of SCHIP. Another Republican felt that the general politicization of the issue was detrimental to children while two articles reported on how Democratic members felt that the passage of the bill would be beneficial for low-income children. It is also interesting to note that three out of five of these articles that mentioned these effects were published during the period of 4 to 18 October, which was the time period in which the two-week delay of the override vote was scheduled and where politicization was found to be most intense. This correlation may suggest a link between politicization and its effects, whether positive or negative, on the well being of children from low-income families.

Discussion
The term politicization has often been a loaded term with a largely negative connotation, with most assuming that its end result is usually a harmful one. Although my hypothesis assumes such, this paper thus questions if that assumption holds true or if politicization can ever lead to a betterment and improvement of society. Before we further this discussion, it is imperative to be aware that James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay - the founders of this country who crafted The Federalist Papers - had already envisioned the inevitability of conflicting factions in government. They believed that it was human nature to pursue short-term self-interest often at the cost of long-term benefits and were concerned that factions formed around these areas of immediate self-gratification might eventually demolish the moral foundations of civil government. However, Madison, often referred to as the architect of the Constitution, dismissed the quixotic notion of entirely eliminating factions since it would either destroy liberty or entail everyone having the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. (Anderson 2005) He thus championed an extended republic – a larger and more diverse society - with each representative…chosen by a greater number of citizens, believing that while a small republic might be torn apart by factions, the larger number of representatives chosen would guard against the cabals of a few. (Anderson 2005) He also believed that an extended republic would reduce the likelihood of one faction advancing its agenda to the omission of others. The usage of popular vote would also make it difficult for undeserving candidates to further their personal agendas at the expense of society at large. In addition, the pluralist reading of Madison's theory also suggests that the government would be a platform in which myriad interests of the society could be acknowledged, with public policy birthed through conflicts and compromises - the push and pull that often defines legislative politics. It is thus this ideology that frames the current American political system and process (Anderson 2005). Therefore, could politicization - defined as partisan conflict - actually be what the founding fathers of America envisioned for it and a much maligned term?",74.28,80.08,74.92,35.42,35122
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Moral Approval and Disapproval,"A. J. Ayer arrogantly proclaims in Language, Truth and Logic that the reason why [ethical concepts] are unanalysable is that they are mere pseudo-concepts. The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. By this, Ayer holds that in pronouncing moral judgments, rather than presenting any proposition that can be either true or false, the speaker is expressing certain moral sentiments-her moral approval or disapproval of the action. Accordingly, Ayer declares that when two observers dispute the morality of an action, they can only establish the facts and intricacies that compose the particular moral dilemma. They do so under the assumption that once they have established all the empirical facts, a consensus as to the morality of the issue will be reached. As Ayer states, And as the people with whom we argue have generally received the same moral education as ourselves, and live in the same social order, our expectation is usually justified. However, once the two have agreed upon all the facts of the case at hand, if disagreement between them persists, Ayer states that no ground is left for further meaningful discourse. The two must abandon their efforts to convince one another and instead can only resort to blows and abuse.

In referencing the role of moral education Ayer creates for himself a difficult, if not inconsistent position. Education is a type of discourse that involves the transfer of a psychological property, such as a skill, idea, knowledge, belief, etc. from one party to another. It requires that the different parties possess different psychological states. More specifically in order to engage in the educational process, the two parties' psychological states must differ in degree to which each possesses the particular property that is to be transmitted. In regard to ethics, Ayer distinguishes between moral attitudes and the empirical facts that surround and direct them. Accordingly, moral education could occur through the transfer of morally relevant, empirical facts from one knowledgeable party to another party less knowledgeable about the particular facts or through the transmittal of moral attitudes between parties with differing attitudes. However, as stated above, Ayer claims meaningful discourse, of which moral education seems to be one type, cannot continue between persons that possess differing moral sentiments. Therefore, if two persons with different states of moral attitude cannot engage in discourse, then moral education must be limited to the role of establishing relevant empirical facts.

However, circumscribing the scope of moral education to only the facts that surround the morality of the issues does not seem to encompass the entirety of the role of moral education. Consider Herodotus' examination of the Greeks and Callatians. At first glance, it should be unsurprising that the Greeks and Callatians expressed differing moral attitudes concerning the treatment of their dead. Let us presume that King Darius numerated to each group what each method of disposing corpses entailed so that all were clear on the relevant facts. Once the facts are established, according to our limited definition, all would presumably have the same moral education concerning the morality of the alternate treatments of the dead. It seems peculiar that among all participants receiving the same education that disagreement would arise, and arise along national lines. Did the Callatians' collective disapproval of burning their parents' corpses and their approval of devouring them arise spontaneously among each individual's isolated moral attitudes? Would not the distribution of moral attitudes fall at random in different areas? If moral discourse is limited purely to the facts surrounding the case such a distribution of moral attitudes is unlikely and it seems that Ayer does not sponsor such a limiting role for moral education either. Though seemingly inconsistent with the belief that discourse between moral attitudes themselves cannot exist, Ayer recognizes that differences in moral conditioning can cause one person to approve of an action and another to disapprove of the same action. This may have the appearance of an ad hoc criticism of an otherwise excellent work. However, the questions remain; What form can moral education take under an expressivist theory? and From where do moral attitudes arise? Ayer's explanation alludes only to abuse. Ultimately, expressivists' prohibition of dialogue between moral attitudes, interests, principles, or systems of value is far too limiting to construct a moral theory capable of comprehensively addressing the depth and complexity of moral education.

Perhaps as a direct attempt to refine Ayer's claims, Charles Leslie Stevenson states in The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms that social moral influence doesn't operate through sticks and stone alone. Stevenson claims that passionate appeals, for instance, may influence the audience to change temperament and align their moral interests or attitudes with those that the speaker expresses. He states that such an appeal is often the only way to obtain ethical agreement, if there is any way at all. It is persuasive, not empirical or rational; but that is no reason for neglecting it. While emotional manipulation is common, I am reluctant to concede that most moral education takes this form. Such an emotional concession seems too fleeting to explain the source of individuals' and communities' moral responses and convictions that often persists throughout moral agents' lifetimes.

In his discussion of the prescriptive role of ethical statements, Stevenson offers a more comprehensive explanation for the rise of common moral attitudes within societies despite the absence of engagement of differing moral interests. Both Stevenson and Ayer observe that moral statements' expression of moral attitudes have inlaid within them prescriptions that others should also have similar moral attitudes. Ayer states that moral statements are calculated also to arouse a feeling, and so stimulate action. Stevenson terms this the dynamic function of moral statements. While Ayer merely notes the existence of the prescriptive intent of moral statements, Stevenson argues that such prescriptions do influence the audience to adopt similar moral attitudes.

One man saysThis is good; this may influence the approval of another person who then makes the same ethical judgment, which in turn influences another person, and so on. In the end, by a process of mutual influence, people take up more or less the same attitudes. Between people of widely separated communities, of course, the influence is less strong; hence different communities have different attitudes.

According to Stevenson (and Ayer), when one observers that, Torture is wrong, he means essentially, I disapprove of torture and you ought to too. All moral utterances will ultimately reduce to this form. For instance, if Stevenson states Torture is wrong because it is dehumanizing, this begs the question Why are things with dehumanizing properties wrong? Were he to answer, because most people do not like being dehumanized, I could then press him to justify that reason and the next until we reach his basic belief that fits the form X is wrong, in which he means, I disapprove of X and you ought to too. If I press Stevenson once more why I should accept his basic moral principle that X is wrong, admittedly, Stevenson can eventually offer no further explanation in accordance with his expressivist theory. It would be meaningless. Stevenson argues that such moral expressions influence the audience in a way that ultimately leads to consensus of moral attitudes within populations. Under Stevenson's expressivism, the common moral attitudes within populations must arise from a moral education composed exclusively of a combination of establishing empirical facts and the influence of conformity. Ultimately, Stevenson is arguing that the education of moral attitudes offers no other reason past the statement, Because I said so, and that this statement does provide valid influence. Few children have been satisfied with such a justification, and it seems unlikely that whole societies would be.

Expressivists' prohibition of discourse concerning the validity of these moral principles seems too limiting to offer a viable explanation of individuals' moral attitudes on which expressivism is based. This is not say that others' moral statements do not influence our moral attitudes, only that they are insufficient in completely explaining the rise and refinement of our moral attitudes. It seems that people are capable of engaging their moral interests, attitudes, principles, and systems of value, evaluating the legitimacy of them and may tune them accordingly. Such engagement would be of the form I ought not disapprove of that action. Ayer and Stevenson would state that such a statement would simply mean, I disapprove of my disapproval of that action and they are right to find such a statement meaningless. The speaker is clearly conflicted with no possible method of reconciliation.

However, statements of the first form do seem legitimate. For instance, if the speaker is insincere in his expression of a moral attitude it seems that his expression lacks legitimacy. Ayer and Stevenson would likely object to this by stating that at which point the speaker treats the expression as an action making it susceptible to another moral expression. The expression would more accurately resemble, I ought not have disapproved of that action, and at a deeper level would be something similar to I disapprove of speaking insincerely. This is not the meaning of disapproval to which I am referring. I am postulating that one can actively engage her actual moral attitudes and evaluate them.

Expressivists treatment of empirical facts does offer limited engagement of moral attitudes. Ayer states that empirical facts may point out that moral attitudes are wrongly applied to particular cases. Additionally, as Stevenson states, the empirical method is relevant to ethics simply because our knowledge of the world is a determining factor to our interests. Establishing an accurate perception of the world is vital to ensure that the agent can acutely assert moral approval or disapproval consistent with deeper moral principles. Within an accepted system of value the superficial moral attitudes must be refined in order to satisfy more basic moral principles. However, under expressivism the agent must align inconsistent moral attitudes only so far as one moral attitude is reliant upon the other. Stevenson and Ayer agree that rationality only functions within the framework of systems of value once such a system has been adopted and cannot apply to the adoption of moral principles or interests. Were both these moral attitudes entirely free-standing, expressivism can offer no prescription for which moral attitude is to be maintained nor can it proclaim that such inconsistencies are problematic. However, the expression of inconsistent fundamental moral principles can have no prescriptive meaning, nor any meaning whatsoever. In expressivist terms, inconsistent moral principles would produce expressions of the form I disapprove, I approve of that action. Thus, those whose moral principles are not pinned by a comprehensive, multilayered system of value, with a clear source of value, may often find themselves in circumstances cognitive dissonance incapable of producing moral prescriptions. Consequently, if an agent's moral attitudes are to have any prescriptive meaning the agent must develop systems of value to the greatest possible depth and centricity. It seems that moral education should and does engage students' moral systems and hold them up to the scrutiny of rationality. In so doing, moral education should explore viable points upon which moral systems may be centered pushing deeper the fundamental principles upon which moral attitudes may hang. This role of moral education is one which expressivism is incapable of handling. It assumes such systems to be preexistent and stubbornly stagnant. However, the role of moral education seems more comprehensive. In order to ensure that moral systems are capable of producing meaningful moral attitudes, moral education must apply the empirical method to fundamental moral principles in a way with which expressivism cannot cope.

Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Pits and Folds of Religious Tolerance,"With growing world population and globalization, religions are finding themselves in closer and closer contact, forced to face issues of integration and differentiation like never before. Conflicts seem to occur most often when one religion does not allow the presence of its neighbor religion and so seeks to alter their presence or activities, even the religion itself. The precursors to intolerant stances toward interaction with other religions cause difficulty for working toward a society of peaceful coexistence. Thus, several philosophers have attempted to provide arguments which encourage the religious and nonreligious alike to engage with their society in a tolerant manner regarding religion. These proposals range from appealing to human fallibility to epistemic certainty, from truth to trust to autonomous individuality. Ultimately, these arguments seem to fall short when they reach religious groups or individuals which claim to know absolute truths and cannot be convinced otherwise.

T.M. Scanlon first discusses the difficulties of the mere mechanics of being tolerant by asking about the clash which occurs between the tolerant and the intolerant. Certainly in advocating tolerance, one would like to spread its adoption throughout all strata of society. Yet how does one spread the adoption of tolerance to the intolerant ones? If the tolerant ones allow intolerance because the intolerant ones are entitled to their beliefs and actions also, then it seems the tolerant ones are not dedicated to their ideal. However, if the tolerant ones disallow intolerance because it is contrary to the ideal of tolerance, then it seems the tolerant ones betray their ideal through their methods. Here arises a sort of paradox. Scanlon himself addresses precisely this issue, asking whether it is intolerant to enforce tolerance in behavior and prevent the intolerant from acting on their beliefs. 1 He asserts that it is surely not intolerant to enforce tolerance. He clearly reinforces his position by also asserting that it is allowable both to espouse tolerance as an official doctrine and to deny the intolerant the opportunities that others have to state their views. 2 This stance may seem slightly contradictory to the aims of tolerance, but other advocates of tolerance (such as Karl Popper) agree with Scanlon, and so it may be reasonable to accept it for now.3

To begin this discussion, Scanlon addresses the difficulty with even considering a basic question of tolerance. He first asks why should I want to interfere with other people's religious practice, provided that they are not able to impose that practice on me? 4 This question frames a principal starting point for the discussion, the sources of intolerance, and sets the stage for introducing the problems with a basis for tolerance. Scanlon opens his essay with the powerful assertion that tolerance requires us to accept people and permit their practices even when we strongly disagree with them. 5 Although this may seem to follow naturally from the definition of tolerance, its gravity derives from its implication that tolerance requires at the very least a disagreement with others, but also allows any negative disposition up to open and violent hostility. Even those of us who hold no resolute convictions or no intolerance whatsoever are in danger of being subject to another's disapproval or disdain. Thus, Scanlon's question becomes subject to deeper examination, and he compliments the question by noting that tolerance involves costs and dangers for all of us. 6 Here, he means that by allowing other religions to coexist in one's own society means to allow a profoundly disagreeable or even malignant influence to continue to thrive. To many or most, allowing such a thing is counterintuitive to advocating a better society.

Scanlon poses this problem, for those who find fault with the beliefs or practices of others and the others' influence on their common society must be persuaded that there is an ideal more valuable than the one being violated. Yet the negative judgment among religious groups stems from a conviction that one's own beliefs and practices are the most correct or most important. In a sense, then, convincing such resolved religious groups or individuals requires altering either their self assessment of their beliefs or their actual beliefs themselves. Many philosophers have adopted varied strategies for approaching this problem, and Scanlon himself proposes an argument.

Scanlon advocates tolerance in spite of the drawbacks of allowing doctrines and practices which one may abhor. He notes that tolerance involves a more attractive and appealing relation between opposing groups within a society. 7 This quotation seems to exemplify an assumption that peace is better than truth, that ethical gain overrides epistemological gain. Scanlon confirms this assertion by stating that rejecting [toleration] involves a form of alienation from one's fellow citizens. 8 However, he further develops this worry by appealing to the unity of society not despite its diversity, but in honor of it. When we deny others, who are just as much members of our society as we are, the right to their part in defining and shaping it, Scanlon suggests that we are then denying the religious alien, so to speak, their rightful place within a common society.9 Here we find Scanlon proposing not only that tolerance provides a peaceful coexistence between religious groups, but that it upholds an implicit value which should be guaranteed to all members of a society. Richard Dees supports the principle of trust in order to secure peaceful coexistence between groups, and the value of one's own individual autonomy is further supported by Bernard Williams and Christopher Megone.

Dees proposes a new criterion upon which he feels both proponents and opponents of tolerance can agree in order to resolve the dispute. He considers rationality the ideal target for such a common ground, but then asserts that toleration finally requires a minimal level of trust. 10 To coexist in a common society, as Scanlon first suggests, Dees argues that toleration requires that we trust them not to harm us in our own pursuits, and of course vice versa. But he notes that if this agreement can be attained, the negative consequences of living in distrust of one another can be avoided, thus averting social unrest, hate-crimes, and even war as in his example of the Catholics and Huguenots. The benefit of avoiding these horrors, he argues, proves worth the dangers of adopting a principle of trust. After all, trust itself poses its own difficulties; we can only possibly gain from mutual trust if we can reasonably expect something we value - not necessarily something that benefits ourselves - can be gained from it. 11 While it is obvious that a peaceful coexistence between disparate groups constitutes a good for society as a whole, it may not outweigh the conviction with which the religious judge each other. Thus the advocate for religious tolerance may find Dees' proposal an interesting perspective on the difficulty of peaceful coexistence but not a final solution to securing tolerance among groups.

Building on Scanlon's implicit suggestion, Williams supports the ideal of tolerance upon the basis of what he calls liberal pluralism. He describes this as a supposedly impartial state, which affirms the rights of all citizens to equal consideration, including an equal right to form and express their convictions. 12 It may seem somewhat unclear whether state here refers to the federal body or to the circumstance of the common society with respect to religion. The former then attributes this statement to Williams as a political ideal, one in which active legislation might support his ideal of tolerance. The latter interpretation attributes this statement to Williams as an inwardly transformative prescription, seeking to bring individuals and individual religious groups into a more tolerant attitude toward each others' convictions. In either case, Williams ultimately advocates the value of one's ability to express their self-chosen convictions. He attributes the most impressive version of this principle to Immanuel Kant, who identifies the dignity of the human being with autonomy. 13 Here Williams picks up where Scanlon left off; to preserve the dignity of the human being, so to speak, one must place the focus perhaps not so much in the value of toleration itself as in a certain more fundamental value, that of autonomy. 14 But he also admits that the success of tolerance then remains only as impervious as the broad acceptance of the value of individual autonomy.15

Megone fortifies the appeal to individual autonomy by first clarifying two essential terms. First, he uses Peter Nicholson's definition of toleration: an individual or group exhibits this trait if an opposing individual or group acts or expresses a thought which he, or it, takes to be not merely incorrect but harmfully wrong; he or it had the power to try to suppress or prevent that act or thought; but the tolerator allows the act to be performed or the thought to be expressed. 16 Referring back to Scanlon's view of tolerance, Megone contests that the acts or thoughts to be tolerated are not simply disagreed with but furthermore judged to be fundamentally harmful to society. This imposes the necessity to find a higher principle which not only seems more valuable than one's deep religious doctrines, but also one which provides a practical counter-weight to the harm of the incorrect acts or beliefs of others.

Megone then appeals to the idea of individualism, a position which states that the justification for the existence of a social condition or a social institution is to be given in terms of the value derived from the individuals involved in that condition or institution. 17 He distinguishes between two kinds of individualism; the first of these conceives of each individual pursuing his own self interest, or satisfying his own desires, whereas the second conceives of the each individual acting on choices in line with his rational will. 18 Megone attributes the former to John Stuart Mill and the latter to Immanuel Kant. He then proposes a third kind of individualism, where the individual is one who properly develops his potentialities, and crucial to such proper development is the agent's exercise of choice. 19 So Megone's proposal of individualism suggests that the progress of society is based upon the progress of the individual, and the individual is valued most when allowed the free exercise of choice. This seems to form the basis for his proposal of tolerance.

To better explicate Megone's implications here, it might help to add that he considers the ability to form and act upon one's own decisions as an essential trait of a good human being. Furthermore, the development of the individual depends both on Aristotle's definition of the human being as a rational animal and also thus on his deliberate inner decision.20 According to Megone, to be good one must choose according to one's own rational deliberation. This goes beyond what he considers Mill's position of individualism and adds to Kant's individualist requirement of rational will by including the actual ability to enact one's own decision. Also, it is clear from Megone's premises that he supposes the only way to a good society can only be through allowing its individuals to engage in rational and autonomous decision making.

Megone finally argues that the possibility of agents fully developing their potential for choice requires toleration of at least some (believed) harmful ways of life. 21 He supports this claim by noting that every individual will have reason to value tolerance under this principle of individualism, for they will always value their own freedom to deliberate and choose the most rational choice, regardless of whether that choice ever changes throughout their entire life.

Megone supplements this consideration for individual autonomy with the value of truth, as the philosophers thus far have neglected to do. It is important not only for individuals to have the privilege of coming to their own beliefs, but it is also important for individuals to form true beliefs. It seems highly likely that all prospective believers, regardless of their beliefs, aim to have true ones, and Megone asserts that everyone has the potential both to know true facts and to understand those facts. 22 He ties the two criteria together by stating that human potential is then realized to the extent that the subject forms true belief. 23 Not only is Megone an advocate of autonomous individuality (coming from a basis of individualism) but also of forming true belief. Thus tolerance for him should be instilled and instituted within society so as to allow individuals the opportunity to both choose and choose correctly, and we must allow for their mistakes if we are to hope for their successes.

Karl Popper continues to examine this new issue of truth by discussing the pressures of intellectual responsibility, the possibility of fallibilism, and the issue of tolerance according to potential intolerant individuals. He quotes Voltaire in the beginning of his essay Toleration and Intellectual Responsibility, introducing his own subject of interest:

What is toleration? It is a necessary consequence of our being human. We are all products of frailty: fallible, and prone to error. So let us mutually pardon each other's follies. This is the first principle of the law of nature, the first principle of all human rights. 24

Although Popper agrees with Scanlon that tolerance is not hypocritical when it attempts to repress intolerance and does not attempt to defend his position on those grounds, he does however present a positive case for tolerance, along the lines of Voltaire's quote. Popper steps further than Megone with his appeal to fallibility by warning against the equivocation of fallibilism with relativism. He recognizes that not all assertions are equal, that we should not behave as though there is something [valuable] in totalitarianism…and in teaching children to be cruel. 25 This alleviates the pressure on Megone and Williams' criteria of autonomy, the possibility that individuals may use their autonomy for harmful ends, even the possible relativism in what Megone and Aristotle may consider rational deliberation.

Popper continues his argument by offering three principles by which we should always conduct ourselves in relation to the religious alien, so to speak. His first principle generally conforms to the worry of fallibility as previously mentioned, stating that I may be wrong and you may be right. 26 He explicitly denies that this is open to be support for relativism, rather he notes that it implies that there may be a right and a wrong view of whatever the issues is; and that, indeed, we may both be wrong. 27

He quickly moves on to the next of three principles, which states that by talking things over rationally we may be able to correct some of our mistakes. 28 Here Popper has left much implicit in his principle. First, he adopts the same notion of rational consideration and deliberation which Megone borrows from Aristotle and Kant. In order to enact Popper's second principle of tolerance, the parties involved must agree to what is rational and must abide by that guideline, and yet he does not question the possibility that disparate religious groups or individuals may have entirely disparate conceptions of rationality. Second, this principle relies on the actuality of the first of Popper's principles; in order for the mutual discussion to benefit both parties, they both must assume that they have something to learn, that they do indeed have mistakes to correct. The first principle introduces the possibility of fallibility, while the second principle assumes the actuality of fallibility, for at least one of the two parties involved. One of the two must be wary enough about their convictions to consider the possibility of learning from the other.

However, assuming Popper is right about fallibilism, he offers a third principle which states if we talk thing over rationally, we may both get nearer to the truth. 29 As Megone suggests, truth is indeed an aim we all have in the formation of new beliefs and the review of old ones. Thus, if Popper can give sufficient reason for believing one has mistaken beliefs, his principles offer a progressive look at the benefit of tolerant and peaceful religious interaction.

Yet the issues of truth and epistemic certainty remain, for if the religious insider considers their beliefs epistemically sound or plainly true then there seems to be inadequate basis for attempting to tolerate on the basis that they have anything to gain by it. Unlike the scientific arts, religious truth and epistemic certainty remain much more elusive and evade the scrutiny of fallibility. To help address these issues, Paul Griffiths examines truth and epistemic certainty in Problems of Religious Diversity.

Griffiths begins the exploration of religious truth by noting that it is precisely religious claims that are potentially possessors of the interesting property of being true. 30 That is to say, he claims that religious beliefs are especially concerned with truth, and especially preoccupied with attaining it. He asserts this paramount importance by asking first are there…forms of religious life that make no claims, explicitly or implicitly? and then answering with conviction that it is fairly clear that there are not and cannot be. 31 To assert that there cannot be forms of religious life which make no claims whatsoever is to tie truth to religious claims necessarily. Griffiths contrasts this assertion by also admitting that not all religious claims are (or can be) true, for there will inevitably come contradiction, contrariety, and noncompossibility between competing claims.32 This not only eliminates the possibility of relativism, in Griffiths' view, but also poses the difficulty that some religious groups or individuals will, at some point, end up being incorrect when they believe themselves correct. This seems to be the fundamental problem with religious interaction and the initial point in needing to advocate tolerance.

Griffiths attempts to reconcile this inevitability with the various convictions by presenting two styles of parity with respect to religious truth: a Kantian view and a Wittgensteinean view. According to Griffiths, Kant asserts that the fundamental religious claim is…discoverable and justifiable by reason alone, unaided by revelation, scripture, authoritative church teachings, or any other extraordinary means available only to a few. 33 This means that the particulars of a religion, its specific deific figures or sacred objects and practices, are secondary to the core doctrines, which generally conform among the world's seemingly disparate religions. Thus, the ideal Kantian religion, then, is one that exhibits an understanding of the insufficiency of its own particulars and recommends this understanding to its inhabitants. 34 However, although Kant's parity may cure the problem of contrary, contradictory, and noncompossible religious claims, Griffiths contests that it will inevitably amount to telling religious people that they misunderstand their religion, a move which he is unwilling to make.

Wittgenstein, on the other hand, treats religious claims as epistemically different from any other claim to truth. Griffiths provides an example of Wittgenstein's gist:

Suppose someone were a believer and said: I believe in a Last Judgment, and I said: Well, I'm not so sure. Possibly. You would say that there is an enormous gulf between us. If he said There is a German aeroplane overhead, and I said Possibly[.] I'm not so sure, you'd say we were fairly near. 35

The difference between the two examples of beliefs in Wittgenstein's quote shows the difference in the believers' attitudes. Religious claims, according to Wittgenstein, have a special status with respect to epistemic certainty and the realm of truth. Griffiths says of Wittgenstein's view of parity that:

most religious communities appear to treat their doctrines and teachings not only as claims to be assented to in a non-hypothetical, non-negotiable fashion, but also as claims that are true in the sense that they accurately…describe the way things are, or commend what ought to be commended. 36

This offer suggests that religious claims cannot be examined in the same way that other truth claims can be, and thus evidence provided for and against such claims becomes seemingly worthless. However, Griffiths contests Wittgenstein by denying that all religious groups and individuals actually treat their claims in this way. With these two views, Griffiths seems to present a fully rational approach and a fully non-rational approach to religious truth, and finds both lacking.

Griffiths finally contests the psychological core of religious claims to truth, as he questions epistemic confidence. He states that clearly, the fact that you think some claim is true won't usually be enough by itself to give you epistemic confidence in your assent to it. 37 However, epistemic confidence comes in degrees, from relative doubt to epistemic confidence to epistemic certainty to the sort of truth claim that Wittgenstein proposed, the kind which is non-negotiable. Griffiths asserts that in one's home religion one primarily holds beliefs of high epistemic confidence, and he grapples with what sorts of condition might cause that confidence to weaken or disintegrate, if any at all. Since it is perfectly obvious to you that you are right about these things, it will follow fairly directly that anyone who believes something incompatible with what you believe about them must, ipso facto, be mistaken. 38 This poses terrible difficulties for Popper's principles regarding fallibility, and undermines nearly every attempt thus far to work toward a meaningful dialogue between opposing religious groups. If Griffiths is accurate about religious epistemology and the way it operates in groups and individuals, then a closer look at the insiders' views seems necessary before attempting to provide a comprehensive and universally agreeable model for tolerance.

Thus, the various philosophers' proposals seem to offer great insight into the issue of tolerance. Scanlon's peaceful coexistence, Dees' appeal to trust, Williams' liberal pluralism and autonomous individuality, Megone's individualism and autonomous individuality, and Popper's appeals to fallibility all provide convincing arguments for some individuals, but Griffiths' worries about religious truth and epistemic certainty can still ultimately undermine all current attempts. A closer look at the religious insiders' views may better elucidate how to provide a universally convincing argument favoring religious tolerance, for the religious and non-religious alike.",0,0,0,3.14,23071
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,THE EMBEZZLEMENT PROBLEM,"Is a person morally required to commit a crime in order to prevent further instances of that crime from being committed? More specifically, is a person morally required to embezzle from her company and commit fraud in order to prevent widespread fraud and loss of pensions? I will use the embezzlement example to examine answers with respect to act-utilitarianism, rule-utilitarianism, and Kantian ethics. Then, I will argue from a rights-based view that one should refrain from embezzling and committing fraud.

Let me begin by stating the example. An employee of a small company, call her Eleanor, is worried that high levels of fraud in current business are leading to the loss of employee pensions. She discovers a way to embezzle from her employer, cover her tracks with fraudulent accounting, and give the money to an organization for the prevention of embezzlement and accounting fraud. The scheme risks leaving employees of her company without pensions; however, it will prevent widespread fraud and widespread loss of pensions. The question is whether or not Eleanor should embezzle and commit fraud in order to prevent widespread fraud and pension loss.

Let us examine an act-utilitarian's response to the problem. Act-utilitarianism stipulates that we ought to perform acts which produce the greatest utility. So, if Eleanor's embezzlement and fraud will produce the greatest utility-that is, the greatest happiness-then she ought to do it. Now, it is dubious that her donation to the organization would actually prevent widespread fraud and widespread loss of pensions, but let us assume for the sake of argument that it will. I take it that, since she works for a small company, its employees do not number very many. Even if all these employees lost their pensions (and they may not, for there is only a risk that they will), the number of people with lost pensions will be less than the number of people whose pensions will be saved by the donation, since the donation will prevent widespread loss of pensions. Assuming that Eleanor's deed does not undermine the principles of fair business practice (and it will not, for it does not seem that she will be caught), then she ought to embezzle and commit fraud, for it will result in the most happiness: more people's pensions will be saved, and less fraud will be committed than had she not acted as she did.

Turning now to rule-utilitarianism, we get a different answer. According to this form of utilitarianism, an act is right if it conforms to a valid rule within a system or rules that, if followed, will result in the best possible [or least bad] state of affairs. 1 It seems that a rule against embezzling and engaging in fraud would be one of the rules in a system like this; it is difficult to see how a rule allowing embezzlement and fraud would contribute to the best possible state of affairs. Even if we were to make the rule more specific, say, to allow embezzlement and fraud in cases where it has the potential to do much good, it seems difficult to accept. It seems that then many people would embezzle from their workplaces, in order to give money to famine relief or other charities. Companies would be unable to operate, and the economy would collapse. People would be unable to support themselves, and everyone would be in need of famine relief. This rule does not seem to result in the best possible state of affairs, or even a better state of affairs than the first rule brings about. Since Eleanor's act of embezzlement and fraud would not conform to the first rule, a rule against embezzlement, it would not be right. Therefore, on rule-utilitarianism she should refrain from engaging in embezzlement and fraud.

The third ethical theory I would like to consider is Kant's. In order to see whether Eleanor should commit the crime, we must formulate a maxim to describe her action and motivations and evaluate that maxim with regard to its consistency as a universal law. Perhaps Eleanor's maxim would go something like this: Whenever I become concerned with the effects of an unjust act, I commit that act in order to prevent or lessen the negative effects of the unjust act. I assume that embezzlement and fraud are unjust on the Kantian view. Presumably, this maxim is not consistent, because it would mean that it is both right and not right to commit any given unjust act. It would be right for those like Eleanor, but not right for those who are causing the negative effects in the first place. I take the consistency requirement to mean, in part, that actions are either right or wrong for everyone, and the rightness or wrongness does not depend on the person committing the action. Therefore, Eleanor should not embezzle and commit fraud.

I, too, think that Eleanor should not commit the crime, based on the view that people have certain rights that must be respected, rights that place constraints on other moral considerations, such as the promotion of happiness. One of these rights is the right a person has not to have his rights violated without consent (either explicit or implicit). I would go so far as to say that it is our moral duty not to violate the rights of others without their consent, and that this duty is one of the most binding, if not the most binding, of the duties. Honoring this duty should come before honoring the duty to promote happiness, to develop one's talents, etc. If Eleanor embezzles and commits fraud, she is violating the rights of the employees of her company, by putting their pensions at risk without their consent. These employees have a right to what they have earned (namely, their pensions), and Eleanor would be violating this right if she were to put their pensions at risk.

In addition to violating the rights of the company's employees, she may also be violating the rights of those who own and operate the company. Perhaps this company is a very good company, one which does good work and is very upright in its business practices. The company's owners have the right not to be exploited and a right to their earnings as well. Clearly, Eleanor would be violating these rights without their consent were she to embezzle from the company. The fact that the company is an upright company matters, because it is possible that the owners would not be entitled to the same rights if they engaged in illegal or unjust business practices. However, even in this scenario the employees are still entitled to their rights, which Eleanor would be violating. Now, if everyone involved in the company were for some reason not entitled to the rights that would be violated if Eleanor were to commit the crime, then it is conceivable that she would be justified in embezzling. Of course, it seems rather far-fetched that everyone involved would not be entitled to the relevant rights.

The objection could be made that the rights of those who are currently losing their pensions because of high levels of fraud in business are being violated as well. Is it not Eleanor's duty to promote the rights of those people, as well as those who stand to lose their pensions if current practice remains unchanged? It does seem that one of our duties is to promote the rights of others, but should this duty be performed at the cost of violating (different) others' rights? I do not believe that it should. The duty to promote the rights of others seems to be a lesser duty than the duty not to violate the rights of others without their consent.

One might also object to the rights that I have granted to people. Do the employees in the example really have the right not to have their pensions put at risk? Yes, I believe they do. A pension provides financial security for an employee's family for many years; without it he will be forced to work even when he is too frail to be able to do so. He certainly has the right to this pension, to the financial security he has earned by many years of work, and it is his right for it not to be put at risk by Eleanor.

On most views examined above we arrive at the conclusion that Eleanor should not commit fraud and embezzlement in order to prevent widespread fraud and widespread loss of pensions. If we take this example to be indicative of the response to the general question of committing a crime to prevent further instances of that crime, then it seems that most of these theories would not support the committing of such a crime. I have argued from a rights-based view that Eleanor should not commit embezzlement and fraud, except in the implausible case that all involved with her company were not entitled to the relevant rights. In the general case, as in the specific case, crimes should not be committed if they violate the rights of others without consent.

Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Emotivism and Solomon's Theory of Emotions,"It was suggested in class that Solomon's theory of emotions spells trouble for the emotivists. If the emotivist wants to reduce ethical utterances to mere emotions, and emotions turn out to be judgments1 (rather than primitive feelings or something of the sort) then it seems that the emotivist has not succeeded in his reduction. However, I want to argue that this is not necessarily the case.

I will begin by looking briefly at A.J. Ayer's formulation of emotivism. On Ayer's view, to say an act is wrong is merely to express a feeling about that act: For in saying that a certain type of action is right or wrong, I am not making any factual statement, not even a statement about my own state of mind: I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments. 2 To use Ayer's example, if I tell you that you were wrong to steal some money, I am just expressing my moral disapproval of the act. The statement You were wrong to steal some money says nothing more about the act than does the statement You stole some money. (421) An additional observation about Ayer's theory should be made. Words such as right and wrong are used to express our feelings, not assert that we have those feelings. Ayer likens the use of right and wrong to a cry of pain. Therefore, statements containing those words cannot be true or false, since they do not express genuine propositions. (422) According to Ayer, to call an act wrong is to express disapproval or similar feelings towards that act (but not assert that one disapproves of the act). Now, Ayer uses the term feelings rather than emotions. We could take him to mean that we are just expressing physical sensations when we make ethical utterances, but let us take him to mean emotions by feelings.

So, on Ayer's theory, ethical utterances are merely expressions of emotions, not even assertions that we have those emotions. If we assume that emotions are judgments then ethical utterances are expressions of those judgments. Ethical utterances are not assertions that we have made any judgments or that we have any judgments. Now, I admit that I do not know what it means for an utterance to be an expression of a judgment but not an assertion of that judgment. It may be that that a judgment's expression and its assertion amount to the same thing. On Ayer's original formulation, it is easy to understand how an ethical utterance could be an expression of, but not an assertion that one has a certain feeling. Ayer tells us that ethical utterances are like cries of pain, and we can understand how a cry of pain is an expression of the feeling of pain, but not an assertion that one has the feeling of pain.3 However, this example does not have a clear parallel in the case of judgments. The expression of a judgment does not seem to be like a cry of pain, nor anything else I can think of; at least, not anything else which could be an expression but not an assertion. But, if expressions of judgments and assertions of judgments are distinct from each other, then it seems that the emotivist has a way out, because he is not saying that ethical utterances are judgments, but that they are expressions of judgments.",7.38,37.3,54.19,54.19,3155
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Reliabilism,"In this paper I examine the reliabilist theory of justification. In particular, I examine the ways in which reliability is determined, and the merits of each way of determining reliability. I suggest that we should use different criteria for determining reliability, depending on the situation.

Briefly, reliabilist theories of justification hold that a belief's justification is a function of the reliability of the processes used to form that belief, where reliability refers to the tendency of a process to produce true beliefs in a person. Memory and perceptual processes which produce beliefs are counted as reliable, while hunches and wishful thinking are not counted as reliable belief-forming processes. Beliefs formed by perceptual and memory processes are said to be justified, whereas beliefs formed by hunches and wishful thinking are said not to be justified. Justification admits of degrees: beliefs can be more or less justified, depending on how reliable their belief-forming processes are. This is, of course, a simplified version of reliabilism, but it captures important elements of the theory and is suitable for our present purposes.

There are two readily apparent ways of determining reliability: either by looking at the tendency of processes to produce true beliefs in the population as a whole, or by looking at the tendency of processes to produce true beliefs in a given individual. I will call the former kind of reliability general reliability, and the latter individual reliability. For memory to count as a generally reliable process, memory must produce true beliefs in most of the people most of the time, and anyone who arrives at a belief that-p through a generally reliable memory process has a justified belief that-p. In order for an individual to count memory as a reliable process, memory must produce true beliefs in that individual most of the time. This kind of reliability allows only the person for whom the process is reliable to count beliefs formed by that process as justified. I would also imagine that there are other ways of determining reliability, one of which is by looking at the tendency of a process to produce true beliefs in a certain group of people, and I will return to this idea later.

It seems that, depending on the case, it is desirable to favor one type of reliability over the others. Here are two cases where it makes sense to favor individual reliability over general reliability. Consider James, a man who has frequent hallucinations, and is aware that he has frequent hallucinations. Because of this, he comes to believe many things which are not true. For example, he believes that he was at school yesterday, when in fact he was never at school; rather, he stayed home all day. He uses a memory process today to form his belief today that he was at school yesterday. To use Alvin Goldman's terminology1, James' input belief at t1 is that he was at school yesterday, and his output belief at t2 (which he arrives at through a memory process) is that he was at school yesterday.

Goldman stipulates that the process used to form the belief at t1 that I was at school yesterday must be reliable. I am not quite sure which process James used to form his initial belief that I was at school yesterday. Probably most of us use perceptual processes to form beliefs like I am at school right now. We later input these beliefs into memory processes which then produce output beliefs like I was at school yesterday. So, James yesterday had perceptions as of being at school and formed the belief I am at school right now. His belief at t1 was formed by perceptual processes, which Goldman tells us are generally reliable. Today, James input his belief from yesterday I was at school and through a memory process came to believe I was at school yesterday, and this is a justified belief. However, James does not form a true belief at t2 about what he did yesterday, even though the process he used to form that belief (a memory process) is counted as generally reliable. Moreover, many of his beliefs which are formed by memory processes will not be true, because of his frequent hallucinations, which cause his input beliefs to be false. But, if the input beliefs are justified, and he uses a memory process to produce new beliefs, these new beliefs will count as justified, according to general reliability. But why should this be so? It is clear that memory processes are not reliable for James 2, at least not when the input beliefs are beliefs formed by perceptual processes. James' beliefs which result from memory processes should not be counted as justified.

Conversely, consider the case of a person whose hunches are very accurate. Maybe this person is like Hercule Poirot, and his hunches produce true beliefs most of the time. However, if we appeal to general reliability, hunches are not counted among reliable belief-forming processes, so our Poirot's beliefs which result from his hunches will not be justified. But this seems wrong. His hunches produce true beliefs most of the time, so why should they not be counted as reliable for him, just because hunches in general are not reliable?

There are a number of reasons to favor individual reliability over general reliability for these cases. It allows us to say, in the hallucination case, that beliefs formed by memory processes are not justified. Indeed, it seems that, for James, memory processes produce false beliefs much of the time, so beliefs resulting from memory processes should not be justified for James. We can also say that our Poirot has justified beliefs that result from his hunches. And, intuitively, this seems right, because his hunches tend to produce true beliefs, so why should we not count those beliefs as justified? With individual reliability, we are also able to easily deal with the problem of the case of wishful thinking in world W, which Goldman discusses. (349) For individuals in W wishful thinking is a reliable process, so beliefs formed by wishful thinking are justified for those in W. We need not say that wishful thinking is always and everywhere reliable, only that it is reliable for individuals in W (and anyone else for whom wishful thinking produces true beliefs). Another benefit of this approach is that reliabilism will get it right more often. If processes are determined to be reliable on a person-by-person basis, then any given reliable process (in relation to the appropriate person) will produce more justified true beliefs than if processes are determined to be reliable by testing their tendency to produce true beliefs in the population as a whole.

Let us now consider a case similar to James' where it seems that we should use general reliability rather than individual reliability. This is the case which Feldman considers in Epistemology (94), of Brian and a certain Brain in a vat: Brain is a normal person with accurate and well-justified beliefs about the world around him. Brain is Brian's mental duplicate. Brain has experiences just like Brian's. And Brain's beliefs are analogous of Brian's. However, most of Brain's beliefs are false, because he is not actually experiencing any of the things which he believes his is experiencing. Feldman suggests that reliabilism runs into trouble here, because it implies that Brain's beliefs are unjustified, when in fact they are justified. And, if we use individual reliability to determine Brain's justification, the result will be that Brain's beliefs are unjustified. However, if we use general reliability to determine the justification of Brain's beliefs, then his beliefs will be justified. His beliefs result from perceptual and memory processes, just like Brian's beliefs, and perceptual and memory processes are both counted as generally reliable, so Brain's beliefs are justified.

What is the difference, then, between Brain's situation and James' situation? Why should we use general reliability for Brain and individual reliability for James? One reason is that James is aware that he has frequent hallucinations, and aware that this affects the beliefs he forms. It would be very strange for James (or anyone else) to think that most of his memory beliefs are justified, and for him to say, Since memory processes produce justified beliefs in most people, my beliefs which result from memory processes are justified, when he clearly knows that his beliefs which result from memory processes are not justified. While we cannot say that believing processes to be reliable makes them reliable, we can perhaps say that when a person knows or suspects that one of his processes which is held to be generally reliable tends to produce false beliefs, then he should use individual reliability to gauge the justification of his beliefs that result from that process. Since Brain is not aware of his situation, he has no reason to doubt the reliability of his processes, and so we use general reliability to determine the justification of his beliefs.

Let us turn now to the case where reliability of a process is determined by looking at the tendency of the process to produce true beliefs not in the population at large, but in a certain group of people. Imagine there is a family whose members have hunches which are almost always correct. Hunches tend to produce true beliefs in members of this family. The mother can always tell, for example, which child made a mess in the kitchen. She has a hunch that it was Susie who made the mess and then forms the belief that Susie made the mess.3 These beliefs are always or almost always true for the mother, and for the other members of the family. It seems reasonable to say, then, that hunches are reliable processes for this family. Now, this family happens to have a son whose hunches are usually wrong. However, the son does not know this, and thinks that he is like the rest of his family. He forms beliefs which result from his hunches, but the beliefs usually turn out to be false. It seems reasonable to say that the son's beliefs which result from his hunches are still justified, even though they are mostly false, because they are justified for the rest of his family, and he has no reason to doubt that he is like the other members of his family, with regard to hunches. The son is like Brain; their beliefs are justified because the processes used to form those beliefs are reliable for a larger population. In the son's case, the process is reliable for his family, and in Brain's case the process is reliable for the population at large.

This gives us another answer to the problem of wishful thinking in world W. Wishful thinking is a reliable process for individuals in W, because it is reliable for the group of people that lives on W. Even if, for a particular individual on W, wishful thinking did not produce true beliefs, that individual could still count as justified beliefs which resulted from wishful thinking, because wishful thinking is a reliable process for the group of people which that individual is a part of. This individual is like Brain and the son. We need not say that wishful thinking is reliable in this world, or that because it is not reliable in this world it is not reliable in W, because this clearly seems false. Wishful thinking is reliable in W.

It seems, then, that there are at least three different ways of determining reliability and, depending on the situation, it is preferable to use a one kind of reliability rather than another. It may be objected that this is a problem, that a reliabilist theory of justification cannot use more than one kind of reliability when determining justification. I do not see why this must be the case. Why should we limit ourselves to one kind of reliability, when this sort of limiting will get it right less often than if we use different kinds of reliability? Probably more extensive criteria then I have suggested must be given for determining when to use which types of reliability, but I am sure that such criteria can be given.

Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,"Hypothetical Imperatives, Moral Imperatives, and the Objectivity of Values","If we accept Mackie's account of the nature of ethical statements, that the cognitivists are right to assert that when we say X is wrong, we mean that X is morally wrong in an objective sense, and, further, that it doesn't make sense for anything to be morally wrong in an objective sense, then it seems that Mackie is right to say that one would have to conclude that we are mistaken to think some acts wrong.1 Now, I'm inclined to agree with Mackie that if we accept that for something to be objectively wrong implies that there is some quality of wrongness out in the world which applies to the act in question, then it doesn't make a great deal of sense to claim that some things are wrong, primarily on the grounds that, like Mackie, I don't believe that such qualities exist. And I will tentatively accept for the sake of argument Mackie's assumption that it is actually meaningful to say that such qualities adhere in actions in the world. But I don't think Mackie's conception of objective values is the only one possible - in fact, I think Mackie is himself committed to the existence of objective values of another sort, which he never explicitly rules out. Mackie is rash, in my opinion, when he says that there are no objective values.

I am unconvinced by Harrison's argument that, because it makes sense for a hypothetical imperative to be right or wrong despite the absence of rightness or wrongness in the world, that it need not be any different for categorical imperatives.2 When I ought to make a certain move in a chess game, the ought is situated in a very specific context - if my goal is to win the game, I ought, logically, to make the moves that will allow me to win the game. The imperative is clearly objective and action-guiding. This sort of ought doesn't exist for categorical imperatives - it isn't clear what, exactly, if they are taken to be strictly categorical, is action-guiding about them. If wrong actions are taken to be wrong in themselves - and it seems they would have to be, if they're taken to be categorically wrong - then the language seems to imply that the actions participate in some quality of wrongness, which somehow adheres in them, and which we, simply because we must, seek to avoid. It doesn't make sense to ask of something declared categorically wrong, Wrong relative to what?

Mackie's objection, then, only effectively applies to categorical imperatives, for only wrongness in the categorical sense seems to commit us to what I agree with Mackie is the rather untenable position that there are real qualities of rightness or wrongness or goodness or badness adhering in things and actions in the world. Harrison is right that calling something right in a hypothetical sense doesn't imply the existence of a separate quality of rightness, but I think he's wrong to claim that it isn't any different for categorical imperatives. It isn't only that the fact that inspection does not reveal anything like an objective characteristic, wrongness, answering to the rather peculiar description Mackie gives of it when we do something which we categorically ought not to do, shows categorical wrongness to not be objective (Harrison, 457). Harrison's point, I think, is not something like, Just because you can't see the wrongness doesn't mean it's not there, but rather, The description Mackie gives of categorical wrongness is the wrong one. But in the absence of such a peculiar description, it doesn't seem that categorical wrongness means much of anything at all. Categorical wrongness, then, is queer in a way that hypothetical wrongness is not.

So insofar as when we make a moral judgment we are saying something along the lines of, Murder is bad or wrong because the act of murder has the objective quality of being bad or wrong, then I accept Mackie's position that at least some of our moral judgments are false. Harrison takes it that Mackie suggests that all of our moral judgments are made in this way, and are therefore false. And yet, as Harrison notes, Mackie seems to commit himself in other parts of his book to what look suspiciously like moral judgments, and it isn't clear how he can reasonably be justified in doing so if he really believes, as he says, that all moral judgments are necessarily false.

It seems it would be most charitable to Mackie, here, to assume that he was hasty in pronouncing all moral judgments necessarily false, or that Harrison has portrayed him accurately, as he seems, on occasion, to assert moral judgments which he feels we ought to regard as somehow true, as when he says As the world is, wars and revolutions cannot be ruled to be morally completely out of the question. The death penalty, I believe, can. (Harrison, quoting Mackie, 459). It seems unlikely that his position really is that when we make moral judgments we must necessarily commit ourselves to the existence of queer, nonexistent moral entities if, despite this, he still feels compelled to make moral judgments of his own. But, in fact, Mackie says only that although most people in making moral judgments implicitly claim, among other things, to be pointing to something objectively prescriptive, these claims are all false (451) (emphasis my own). So he does leave a little wiggle-room. Presumably, then, he means something different in making his moral judgments than he claims the rest of us do in making ours. For instance, Harrison notes that:

Another possibility, which I think might be the one Mackie actually thinks obtains, is that, though all moral beliefs are false, it is better that men believe some of these falsehoods than others. It is neither true, for example, that patriotism is a duty, nor true that it is not one, but, when the dreadful consequences of war with modern weapons are considered, it is much better that men should think that it is not a duty than that they should think it is. (Harrison, 462).

Now, obviously - and Harrison notes this as well - if Mackie is of the opinion that it would be better for us to hold certain moral beliefs than it would be for us to hold others, then he can't strictly hold that all moral judgments are false. When presented with this, I'm not inclined to think Mackie simply doesn't realize that in making his moral pronouncements he's unknowingly (or worse, knowingly) making what he earlier describes as a false claim. It seems more likely that he is overly rash in baldly declaring, There are no objective values, when, really, he only attempts to (successfully, in my opinion) refute the existence of the sort of objective values implied by our common ideas of categorical rightness and wrongness (Mackie, 446). But there are, or could potentially be, I think, objective values of the more hypothetical sort, which I think Mackie is committed to in asserting that it would be better for us to believe in one set of moral claims rather than another. And these, I would assert, surely exist in the trivial way that one really ought to move in certain ways if one wishes to win a game of chess.

If we accept, for instance, Warnock's position that there is an object of morality, which can broadly be described as the amelioration of the human condition, then it seems it wouldn't be terribly difficult to claim, at the very least, that there are objectively good and bad and right and wrong actions when considered in the broadly defined context of human welfare.3 Actions which tend to promote the amelioration of the human condition would be objectively good or right in the sense that certain moves in a chess game might be said to be objectively good or right. And the same could be same of actions which tended promote the opposite. So it would make sense to declare that certain actions were objectively good or bad, without positing any odd properties of the universe. It seems that Mackie thinks (rightly, in my opinion) that the human race would be worse off if patriotism were widely believed to be a moral duty, and that, given that fact, it would be better if we didn't believe it. I suppose one could also say that it would be good if people were to not believe in patriotism as a duty. But were one to say this, I don't think one would be committed to positing that some mysterious quality of goodness therefore adheres to my not believing in patriotism as a duty. My disbelief in patriotism is not good in and of itself, but only in the context of ameliorating the human condition.

Nothing about this seems inconsistent with Mackie's position. As I hope I've shown, he only refutes a particular conception of objective value. If he regards that conception as the only one possible, then I think he must be mistaken. If he doesn't regard the conception of objective value I've outlined above as valid, then I don't see why he thinks he ought to go around making what are certainly moral judgments. If he intends his moral judgments to be understood the way he claims most of us understand them, then, by his own account, he is saying something false. If he intends them in some other way - perhaps in a non-cognitivist emotivist or prescriptivist sense - then he is only expressing his subjective moral attitudes, and yet has enough confidence in the correctness of these attitudes to say something like, As the world is, wars and revolutions cannot be ruled to be morally completely out of the question. The death penalty, I believe, can. I don't understand how something is to be understood as morally completely out of the question in anything other than an objective sense.

It might be objected here that, whether the preceding discussion is correct or not, it is simply not an accurate reflection of how moral reasoning works, or what we really mean when we make ethical judgments. Mackie takes it as a given, for instance, that when most of us (and this is important, because it seems Mackie must consider himself an exception) make moral judgments, we necessarily posit that there are strange moral properties in the fabric of the universe, and that, since these don't exist, all of our moral judgments must be false. But this is really a weaker claim than Mackie makes it out to be. For, as Harrison notes:

It is because we believe, falsely, that certain things are inherently and inescapably morally disgusting that we (irrationally) believe that they are wrong. Our conclusion that such things are wrong, however, could be true, although the reason we have for it is false. When we come to the same conclusion in other cases, there is no reason why what we believe, in those cases, should not be true. (465).

So even if we grant Mackie that most of us have succumbed to his patterns of objectification and now believe in our moral claims on false bases, it does not follow that our moral claims are necessarily false in their purely semantic content. If morality has as its object the amelioration of the human condition, and hence if our moral concepts arose, originally at least, in response to these demands, then it would follow that our actions could be said, in theory, to be right or wrong in relation to the amelioration of the human condition. That many of us now tend to think of morality in ontologically untenable categorical terms does not refute this. Perhaps, then, if Mackie wishes, as Harrison says he does (I regret that I have not had a chance to read the rest of Mackie's book for myself), that we describe as right (or wrong) anything we like in order to modify our existing moral code to meet new needs, abandon those parts of it which are out of date, and invent moral rules to solve quite new problems, he ought to exhort us to break our habit of thinking of morality in categorical terms and to instead think of them in hypothetical terms (Harrison, 461-2). Presumably, when selecting which moral rules would be best to have (and Mackie must allow that we have this ability, lest his position degenerate into incoherence), we would evaluate those rules in light of some end along the lines of the amelioration of the human condition. And, in theory at least, such rules could be considered objectively right or objectively wrong, in light of the object of morality.",0,0,0,22.64,12160
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Doctrine of Double Effect and Intuitions Regarding Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"The Doctrine of Double Effect (henceforth referred to as DDE) and other similar deontological doctrines seek to find a principle by which to explain our moral intuitions about situations in which good can be secured for some people only if others suffer harm (Quinn, 318). The doctrine and the various revisions proposed by Foot, Thomson and Quinn seem to uniformly claim that terror bombing - the killing of civilians for the purpose of demoralizing one's enemy - is wrong. But if these doctrines are to explain our intuitions, it seems they will have to deal with what seems, on the face of it, a rather notable exception to this general rule. It seems to me that the prevailing, intuitive opinion in this country is that the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was justified on broadly utilitarian grounds - many more people, Japanese and American, would have been killed in the event of an American invasion, which is seen as the only alternative to the dropping of the bombs - or so the argument goes. This is, on the face of it, baldly inconsistent - it seems that if we accept that terror bombing in the more general sense is morally forbidden on the grounds that it is wrong to kill civilians as a means to winning a war, then we would have to accept that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which appear to be terror bombings as we have defined them, were morally wrong. Our reluctance to accept this seems significantly problematic for proponents of DDE and other similar theses, or, at the very least, their claims that they have alighted on a doctrine which can adequately account for the principles underlying our moral intuitions on these matters. But I will argue that, in this case, DDE doesn't fail, because our intuitive response to this particular situation depends much on what must be considered morally irrelevant factors.

DDE claims that it is wrong to intend evil to bring about good, but not to foresee that evil will result from an act that brings about good (302). Hence, according to Foot, it is at least morally permissible, and perhaps even morally required, that the driver of the trolley in her trolley example should steer the trolley onto the track on which there is only one person, in order to save the five on the other track, and it is morally forbidden that the magistrate should frame and hang and innocent man in order to save ten hostages from being killed by an angry mob. According to DDE, in the first situation, the death of the first person is not intended, but only foreseen - if the person on the track survives by some miracle, the driver of the tram does not then leap off and brain him with a crowbar. (305) The death of the lone man is not in any sense instrumental to the driver's purpose, which, in this case, is to save the five on the other track, or perhaps more broadly to reduce the number of deaths brought about by the situation. But in the magistrate example we aim at the death of an innocent man directly, and, further, the man's death can be seen as essential to the magistrate's goal (304); If the victim proves hard to hang he must see to it that he dies another way (305). And, presumably, this accords with our intuitions on these matters.

Foot, Thomson and Quinn each offer revisions of this basic theory. Foot contends that the distinction that does the real work in situations like these is that between negative rights and positive rights: the trolley driver is justified in his decision because he is presented with a choice of violating two sets of negative rights, while the magistrate would not be justified insofar as he would be violating a negative right in favor of positive rights, negative rights having greater force than positive rights. Thomson offers that the two cases differ because in the trolley case a threat is deflected, whereas in the magistrate's case a new threat is brought to bear on another party. Quinn distinguishes between direct and indirect and opportunistic and eliminative agency, direct opportunistic agency (terror bombing) being the most odious.

While these revisions make useful distinctions, on the basic premises of the doctrine and on the content of people's intuitions about certain representative situations all three philosophers seem to be in agreement. Let us assume, then, that Foot and Thomson would agree with Quinn's use of terror bombing (henceforth referred to as TB) is a representative example of an act that our moral intuitions tell us is wrong, on the grounds that it directly intends the death of civilians.

DDE and similar theses are presented as shedding light on the principles that guide our moral intuition given these scenarios. It follows, then, that when our intuitions and one of these doctrines disagree, it seems we ought to regard this as a failure of the doctrine in question. Quinn takes it as a given that our moral intuitions revolt against terror bombing as strongly as they revolt against the doctor who kills a patient and chops him up for organs in order to give them to other patients, and it doesn't seem we have any good reason to think him mistaken in this assessment, if we accept, for instance, that it is wrong to push a fat man in front of a trolley in order to save five people on the tracks.

Now, obviously there are a range of opinions on the subject, but I posit that the majority of Americans feel that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified on broadly utilitarian grounds - it is seen as justified insofar the bombings brought the war to a quick end and significantly reduced the loss of life. Whether this opinion accords with the American government's actual reasons for dropping the bombs is of no concern to us, for we are concerned only with popular opinion on the matter insofar as it reflects our moral intuitions. This, it seems, poses a significant challenge to DDE and to all of the revisions offered. The bombings appear quite clearly to be terror bombings as previously defined. It seems that, though we might say that terror bombings in general are wrong because they directly intend to bring harm to civilians, we (that is, those of us from the United States) don't, in fact, tend to accept that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were wrong for the same reasons. And yet if we accept that terror bombings are wrong, or even that it would be wrong to murder one man to prevent the murder of ten men, it seems we would be committed to saying that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were wrong as well.

At this point it seems that one must try to distinguish the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from an ordinary terror bombing - surely if our intuitions tell us that one is right and the other wrong, there must be some morally significant difference between the two. We might appeal to circumstances that arise specifically in wartime between sovereign states - perhaps certain things are moral permissible when done to bring about an end to a prolonged state of war. This reading only makes sense, however, if we construe the TB as something other than an agent working on behalf of one sovereign state against another. But Quinn's TB appears to be a pilot working for a sovereign state - we are to understand him as a pilot just like the strategic bomber. In any case, if we fairly apply the principles of DDE, it ought to make no difference whether the TB works for a state at war with another state or for a terrorist organization. I think that when presented the question, Is it morally permissible for military personnel to specifically target civilians if they have good reason to believe that the deaths of civilians will demoralize the enemy, bring the war to an end, and thereby reduce the overall loss of life, intuition will generally leads us to say no.

One might also suggest that civilians in wartime have negative rights not to be killed. But if their government is waging an unjust war, these rights may conflict with strong rights of self-defense (323). The problem with this is that it leaves up in the air the question of what is or isn't a just war. If the rules of war - one of which is the injunction against the intentional killing of civilians - are to have any value at all, it seems we ought to pay no heed to questions like which side of a conflict is in the right. For it isn't at all clear how one would go about determining this; having one side think themselves in the right is not sufficient. The Americans obviously thought they were on the side of justice, but the Japanese presumably also saw the defense of their homeland and their people as a just cause as well. It seems that this position would simply allow both sides to justify acting in whatever way they deemed necessary to bring the conflict to an end as quickly as possible.

It seems then that there is no relevant moral difference between general terror bombing and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Why, then, do we in this country tend to regard the bombings as justified while simultaneously condemning the specific targeting of civilians in other contexts? If DDE explains the principles behind our moral reasoning in every other case, why does it fail in this specific one? I might claim that this shows that DDE and related theses thus fail to describe the principles behind our reasoning in all other similar cases. But to do this one would have to suppose that DDE claims to offer a single principle, which guides our intuitions in every relevant case. All three philosophers deny this.

I am inclined to say that what guides our intuition in the particular case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki actually has little to do with moral reasoning, per se, insofar as morality seems to involve a universal aspect, if it is to mean anything at all (252). It seems quite obvious that if a moral judgment is to mean anything at all that moral judgments shouldn't vary between different situations when there isn't a relevant moral difference between them. If terror bombings are wrong, then the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, themselves examples of terror bombings as we've defined them, must also be wrong, if we are to faithfully apply moral reasoning.

I think there are a number of factors possibly at play here, none of them particularly morally sound. Perhaps we find it difficult to denounce the bombings because, in addition to substantially reducing the overall loss of life, it ended the war in our favor, and we felt and continue to feel that in that particular conflict the United States was surely on the side of justice. But it seems we would intuitively reject the idea that all states are justified in specifically targeting civilians so long as they believe themselves to be on the side of justice. And, as I mentioned earlier, there doesn't seem to be any good way to determine what exactly constitutes one side's being on the side of justice. We might also be inclined to justify the bombings out of a sense of duty to our country or our countrymen; the particularly nationalist among us might, for instance, consider the bombings a good thing on the grounds that it saved a lot of our men from being killed. It doesn't seem terribly farfetched, after all, to suppose that a nation has a duty to reduce the number of its own soldiers killed in combat when possible. Again, though, I don't think there's any way our intuitions would allow us to accept a moral principle such as Any country is justified in targeting civilians so long as they have good reason to believe that this will save the lives of its own men.

All of this, I think, points to a rather unfortunate fact about human moral reasoning: it can very easily be made flexible when our sense of self-interest demands it. I will not speculate on the U.S. government's actual rationale for dropping the bombs. But it seems to me that we who must come to terms with the bombing today find it all much easier to swallow when we can convince ourselves that such a terrible event was morally justified. And so where we might condemn another country for acting just as we did, we consider our own actions justified. Out of a sense of guilt, or a simple unwillingness to acknowledge moral responsibility, we intuitively try to justify our actions using whichever principle yields a result we are best able to suffer in our consciences. Our moral reasoning works best when we apply it to situations which don't bear directly on ourselves - a wrong visited on oneself is nearly always perceived as worse than a wrong visited on another. If things had been different, if the Germans had had the atomic bomb and had dropped one on Moscow and one on St. Petersburg, with the goal of killing so many civilians so quickly that the demoralized armed forces of the Soviet Union would be forced to surrender, I think that most us would almost certainly conclude - correctly - that they would have been wrong to do so. It takes a kind of strength of character to apply moral reasoning truly fairly, and it would seem that, collectively, in this case and probably in others, we often lack it.",0,61.36,23.31,39.85,13053
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,The Movement of Homosexual Marriage into the Public Sphere,"Marriage is and always will be a private contract between individuals. The boundaries of marriage in our country have been concrete for centuries. However, they are currently being questioned. Should marriage remain defined as the union between a man and a woman? There are many individuals who think the current definition of marriage is insufficient. Homosexual couples deserve the same union and legal rights as heterosexual couples, with full liberty to celebrate their union as they wish in the public sphere. My argument for the rights of homosexual couples to be married under the same circumstances as heterosexual couples is comprised of a few basic points. Homosexuals are afforded all the same rights and liberties as heterosexual individuals - as long as they are individual. To take away the specific liberty to choose your own partner is immoral and creates an inequality in society. Homosexual couples have the negative right of noninterference (Hospers, 1974), which I will later discuss along with the benefits of Rawlsian theory as a moral framework. As Horowitz (2004) discusses, there is a difference between the private sphere and public sphere in a relationship, and according to him, homosexuals are perfectly acceptable if they limit themselves to the private sphere. However, I will argue that this is a loss of liberty. No one can morally be confined to their home without the opportunity to express themselves freely and publicly. In an expressive dimension, the roles of homosexuals as a part of society's norm are still being defined. There is a great need for recognition of homosexuality as normal in order for homosexual marriage to become a norm.

Legally, homosexual couples have the right to be treated equally under the law, because, as I will argue, their liberty is otherwise lost. The right of a homosexual couple to marry falls under a basic moral framework that is laid out by Rawls (1971). I will discuss Rawls' argument shortly, and will now argue that homosexual couples are entitled to the rights and liberties given to heterosexual couples by our government. To neglect their right and the benefits of marriage is taking away the acknowledgement of their partnership, which is valued in our society. This is important because each individual is entitled to be viewed equally under the law to receive liberties and benefits that the union of marriage brings. It is not the right of the government or other political figures to limit or take away rights that each individual is entitled to. Rights, as I am speaking of them, are the certain benefits that have already been outlined in each state's marriage license, and grounded in each state's legislature, that our government is obligated to give each individual when he or she becomes married. These rights include, but are not limited to: reductions in housing costs, income taxes, pensions, and insurance premiums (Horowitz, 2004, p.465). The right to adopt a child is another right that the government grants to heterosexual couples, but is difficult for homosexual couples. Proponents of limiting the rights of gay and lesbian couples feel as though homosexual couples cannot nurture or be able to provide for a child the way that a heterosexual couple can. This is an extremely false and discriminative presumption, as I personally know of a couple who is more caring and concerned for their daughter than many heterosexual normal couples. The importance of adoption by homosexual couples is an important topic, but will not be of discussion in this argument. The moral argument for homosexual marriage includes discussion about treating each person equally and abstaining from discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. My argument is for legal recognition and the terms under which society views homosexual marriage.

Rawls (1971) draws upon two different primary social goods in society - liberty and opportunity. The principles chosen include equal political liberty and opportunity to engage in a union with regard to your sexual preference. Homosexuals have the liberty to make their own decisions and are entitled to legally be protected from having the views of others thrust upon them. This is a negative right (Hospers, 1974) which states that each individual, without concern for sexuality or gender roles, has a right of noninterference. This Libertarian viewpoint can be incorporated into the liberties that Rawls calls upon for each individual in society. Homosexual couple can not feel a sense of liberty when they are being harassed with the negative viewpoints of others in society who condemn their union. As marriage becomes more culturally oriented, the social context of marriage keeps changing. This reflects a change in many people's belief systems, but these beliefs can never change the rights or opportunities of any individual. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to choose your own partner regardless of sex, and society is still conforming to this realization.

A common objection is one that many people in society hold, and is argued by Horowitz (2004). He proposes an argument that homosexuality is perfectly acceptable in the private sphere, but not the public sphere. This argument is incredibly presumptuous because it tries to restrict homosexuals because of a personal preference. An argument like this is analogous to discriminating against individuals who choose to die their hair pink. His hair hurts no one else, other than perhaps making one uncomfortable with the glaringly bright head, but it is up to him to be able to assert his individuality without intrusion. Perhaps it makes you uncomfortable that his hair is such an outrageous color. On the other hand, maybe he is uncomfortable with your monotone colors and unfashionable dress. In the same manner, there is no reason why another needs to hide his pride and love for his partner within the private sphere. Morally, this is against his right for equality. Also, if Horowitz allows homosexuals to behave however they please in the privacy of their homes, he is recognizing that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the two as a couple, he just does not wish to see them. Personally, I find a public display of affection just as repulsive when it involves a heterosexual couple as well. It makes no difference what the sexes are of the two people involved, it should just be understood that kissing in a café is not pleasant for bystanders regardless of the couple's sexual orientation. This is a weak argument against public unity of homosexual couples on the part of Horowitz because he contradicts himself by allowing their right to be a couple, and then not allowing it where he can see it. His argument is easily refuted by citing that under the moral framework to which I am appealing, each individual, with no regard to sexual preferences, has equal liberty in a society.

The movement for homosexuals' right to marry is moving increasingly closer to the norm in society. They are being recognized by more people as legitimate and deserving of rights, and the movement towards legalizing their marriage has reached several important points making the case stronger. The states of Massachusetts and Wisconsin in the late 1980s had enacted laws forbidding discrimination against homosexuals (Horowitz, 2004, p. 463). This is a step toward making gay marriage an expressive norm in society concerning their legal opportunities and rights. This is very important and a great step in the right direction, but the acknowledgement of homosexual marriage in an expressive dimension is still imperative. These two states have made it illegal to discriminate against them, but they are a small minority in our county. Complete recognition of homosexual marriage is necessary to make it a norm in society. Homosexual couples are legally entitled to a concrete statement of their love for each other due to their right for liberty and opportunity under the Rawlsian framework. Recognition is needed to debunk the current assumption in society that homosexual couples are not fit to fill the roles of husband and wife as most people see them. Homosexual couples adjust these roles to create a bond for them that becomes just as meaningful, and morally, cannot be denied. The norm that homosexual couples would be incapable parents, for example, due to social stigmas is the fault of society, not their own. Recognition of homosexual marriage as a norm is the first step to removing these stigmas and others from society.

Marriage is a private contract that will always stand. Who can be included in that contract needs to change, by virtue of the contract's exclusiveness and moral inequality. Homosexuals have the right to be married for several reasons in order to be granted equality as individuals. They have a right to liberty and opportunity, meaning that they can choose whomever they wish as a partner and morally have the opportunity to be married should they so choose. Homosexual couples have the right to equality, so Horowitz's argument that they are acceptable only in the private sphere is an infringement of their liberties. In order to make all these points more acceptable to the public, homosexual marriage is moving into its place in the expressive dimension. Same sex couples are not becoming norm-al, but their establishment as a cultural norm is becoming more prevalent. In an argument for their liberty and equality, the homosexual marriage legally and socially belongs in the public sphere.",70.34,63.2,39.92,25.57,9544
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Early Fetuses and Constitutional Rights,"I. The Problem of Fetal Rights
The Supreme Court deliberates many contentious cases with lasting legacies. Most cases instead see a place for fetal rights, but instead get lost in language of a compelling state interest, or the life and health of the mother. Among the most controversial decisions are those from Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of S.E.P.A. v. Casey. Although both cases allow state governments to curtail abortion in third trimester pregnancies and give greater state control over legislation regarding pre-viability fetuses, these cases construct rights for fetuses unconstitutionally. While there are current restrictions on third term abortions and suits based on injury to fetuses, pro-choice groups still insist that fetuses are not guaranteed Constitutional rights. If the fetus has no Constitutional rights and thus no standing in courts, the arguments for abortion restrictions and suits involving the unborn would no longer have any legal basis.

I believe that the fetus is not guaranteed rights under the Constitution. I do not believe that the fetus has any textual claim to rights, nor do I believe it was the intent of the founding fathers that claims could be made on behalf of the unborn. Although the constitution does not specifically address fetal rights, past cases and the Fourteenth amendment are clear enough on the matter. These sources do not create fetal rights.

II. Compelling Arguments in Favor of my Position
There several reasons for which I believe a fetus is not entitled to Constitutional rights. Textual evidence supports this claim. A citizen, as defined by the Constitution, cannot be expanded to include fetuses. Initially, the Constitution only protected the rights of white men, but this concept of rights was expanded following the Civil War. This new identity of the citizen, as defined by amendments and the enfranchisement of women, should be our only conception of Constitutional rights. The Fourteenth amendment illustrates the current textual definition of a citizen, All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. 1 Whether or not persons excluded women, in 1918, they were given the right to vote, and from that moment given the same rights as all other citizens.

This text contends that only born persons are entitled to Constitutional rights. Fetuses clearly are excluded by the Fourteenth amendment. Case law supports this definition of citizenship and rights. In spite of the fact that Plessy v. Ferguson was the wrong decision and a blemish on the history of the Supreme Court, it does reveal the way that the court thinks about citizenship:

…we must not confound the rights of citizenship which a state may confer within its own limits, and the rights of citizenship as a member of the Union. It does not by any means follow….no State can, by any cat or law of its own…introduce a new member into the political community created by the constitution of the United States.-Dred Scott V. Sanford (1857)2

Although this ruling has since been reversed, it leaves a legacy of who has rights and who does not. This decision indicates that the Supreme Court used the Fourteenth amendment in determining rights, and should form the basis for future considerations of rights. It is within the text of the law, and the Supreme Court can argue about this amendment's intention, but it cannot extend rights too far. Even if a state intended to give rights to a fetus, it cannot extend American Citizenship. This means that there is no Constitutional basis for fetal rights in spite of court rulings that have found certain rights. These protections extended by Roe and Casey, and discussions of compelling state interest in fetal life, have no legal basis.

III. Opposing Arguments and Conceptions of Fetal Rights
Legislators have tried to carve out legal protection for fetal life. Traditionally, legislators have determined that a compelling state interest existed to protect fetal life. One reason for the belief that fetal life is a state interest evolves from the concept of fetuses as proto-persons. Due to this status lawmakers feel fetuses should have some rights. Pro-life law-makers use the same passage of the Fourteenth amendment to extend rights to proto-persons. They claim that, because this passage uses the term all persons the authors intended this to include persons about to be born.

The second half of the proto-persons argument denies the right of privacy found by the Supreme Court in the Roe… decision. Here pro-life advocates claim that the right to privacy did not include abortions. That due to the harm inflicted on other persons, women should not have a right to privacy with regards to abortion.

While the following argument compared fetuses to proto-persons, there exists another anti-abortion argument of comparison. This argument relies on a more emotional version of the proto-persons theory. The third trimester rule laid out in Roe and expanded in Casey, creates a problem for deciding when a fetus is too much like a child. If the fetus were outside the womb, such an act would be considered infanticide. Although a fetus may not survive outside the womb in its early stages of development, viability is occurring earlier and earlier due to medical advances. If this stage occurs before the third trimester, then this rule no longer works. We also should consider these earlier fetuses to be like infants since medical advances make it possible for them to survive outside of the womb, fetuses should be protected at an earlier point.

Another problem for pro-choice activists stem from legal suits brought on behalf of people harmed while fetuses. Increasingly lawsuits have arisen based upon actions that have caused harm to a fetus. Suits for malpractice have been fought in the court by injured parties after birth. Some legal actions are even enacted before the birth of the child. These include incidences of pregnant women forced to undergo drug tests, and criminally prosecuted as a result. These instances illustrate how fetal rights can take precedence over the rights of pregnant women. Most of these cases result in the mother being charged with delivering drugs to minors, and the removal of the infant from its mother's care, but there have been attempts to pursue charges of child abuse.3 These types of lawsuits are only applicable if the victim is given Constitutional rights. Harm before birth, now receives similar treatment as harm inflicted on an infant. Such developments challenge the belief that fetuses are not constitutionally protected, and continue to restrict the actions of pregnant women. At the extreme end of this trend, there have been introduction of new laws protecting the fetus, e.g. Lacey's law which allows suit to be brought against the wrongful death of the fetus when the pregnant mother dies.

Another difficult argument stems from metaphysical beliefs about human life. Some pro-life supporters believe that a pre-viability fetus is no different than a later fetus, or an infant. According to this argument, at conception the fetus has a soul. At any point after conception the death of a fetus has moral weight, because no metaphysical difference between a grown adult and a three week old fetus exists. This religious argument draws the conclusion that the Constitution should protect this form of life, because life has meaning at any stage after conception. The Constitution, they argue, was written with the purpose of upholding Christian morality. Due to the fundamental purpose of the document, legislation should coincide.

IV. Response to the Argument in Favor of Fetal Rights
The first argument made in favor of fetal rights due to a compelling state interest commits a serious mistake in its reasoning. First, the state cannot have a compelling interest to create rights for an unprotected group when it restricts the rights of a constitutionally protected group. Fetuses are not constitutionally endowed with the rights of a citizen, if any at all. Women have Constitutional rights, so it should be within those rights not to be compelled by the state to carry unwanted pregnancies. Second, the extension of all persons born… to include any unborn person directly contradicts the meaning of that passage.

I also object to the reasoning of the second half of this argument. Women were given the right to privacy in Roe v. Wade, to deny this decision calls into question all decisions made by the court. To argue that the court did not actually mean to include abortion in the right to privacy, when it clearly states that to be their intent, seriously damages the credibility of Supreme Court decisions. Additionally, the decision to abridge the rights of a protected group on behalf of an unprotected group speaks to a blatant violation of women's rights. It is unequal treatment of a group, which is entitled to treatment equal to other groups under the law. Men can not be compelled to care for a fetus. To compel a pregnant woman to carry a fetus to term is unequal treatment under the law. Whether the Supreme Court found this right within enumeration of privacy, or within the equal rights amendment, one group should not be made to suffer an unwanted pregnancy. The compelling state interest should not include compulsory childbirth. Instead, it should protect the rights of citizens, the right to privacy and equal treatment.

I also disagree with the validity of the second argument by comparison. Even if the fetus may survive outside the womb and appears like an infant, they are not guaranteed any rights. Once the fetus is born it is an infant, but not before. There is something emotionally compelling about this argument, but it has no legal basis. Norman C. Gillespie addresses this phenomenon of legal protection on the basis of comparison, in his description of the Spectrum of Rights.4 As a society we conceive that an about-to-be born fetus has rights, because of its resemblance to an infant. The problem, Gillespie argues, lies in drawing a line between an about-to-be-born fetus and an infant. He suggests that we give rights on a comparative basis relative to the fetus' development.5 While this attempts to recognize the real controversy of the portrayal of fetuses, there is no Constitutional basis for giving a fetus any rights. If we accept that late fetuses are considered to have rights within our society, we again face the problem of drawing a line and disparately affecting the rights of citizens.

Legal suits brought on behalf of harmed fetuses have no Constitutional basis, but enter the debate of the moral status of fetuses. The idea that fetuses harmed in utero that become persons should be compensated, strikes a chord even among pro-choice supporters. Elizabeth Harman attempts to reconcile this inconsistency with her Actual Future Principle, An early fetus that will become a person has some moral status. An early fetus that will die while it is still an early fetus has no moral status. 6 An early fetus here refers to a fetus that is not yet viable. This, she argues, is due to the moral implications of the choice of carrying a child to term, failing to abort a pregnancy is morally significant. Creating a person always involves occurrences of great moral weight. 7

An abortion has no moral consequences, but carrying a child to term is morally significant. It is not the idea that you intend to carry the child to term that gives moral weight, but the fact the child is actually born. This allows for a suit on behalf of an individual that was harmed in utero, because, once it is born, the harm done to the fetus has moral implications. It would be a false action, however heart felt, to mourn or place blame if an early fetus dies. This is because the fetus has no moral weight, but the concept of the fetus as an infant has caused this mistaken belief. This would not be enough to convince a strong believer in fetal rights that damage to an early fetus has no moral implications, but it is a philosophical argument supported by the Constitutional conception of rights.

One difficulty with Harman's argument, is the fact that it supports the notion that it is okay to legislate for the protection of the fetus. This would have major consequences for legislating the behavior of pregnant women. If legislators make laws due to these suits against the actions of pregnant women their rights will continue to be restricted. A ban on drinking could lead to legislation against smoking and even drinking caffeine. The problem would arise of where legislators should stop restricting the rights of pregnant women to protect the fetus.

The final argument, in favor of fetal rights due to metaphysical beliefs, has no legal basis. One cannot rely on religion to carve out legal protection when no textual basis for this trend exists. Furthermore, the Constitution explicitly separates church and state in spite of the religious rights' strong conviction that such legislation is implicit. No legal theory in the United States can be based on religious belief, if there is no Constitutional basis for doing so. The strong feeling about metaphysical beliefs cannot be used to create legal protection.

V. Conclusion
The problem of fetal rights will continue to be fought at the state and federal level until science and religion can agree on the status of the fetus. While law forms the basis for our society, religion continues to control the morality of lawmakers and the Supreme Court. The moral majority controls the legislative decisions that favor fetal rights. Unfortunately, no amount of philosophical arguments in support of the current status of Constitutional rights will convince pro-life leaders to the contrary. Instead the law must satisfy the controversy of fetal rights. New conservative Justices, Roberts and Alito, may be forced to consider the question of abortion and fetal rights in the not so distant future. While they claim to be strict Constitutionalists, it would not be inconsistent for their moral qualms to contradict their legal philosophy. Moral beliefs will not be easily reconciled with the text of the Constitution. Regardless of the clarity of the Constitution in this matter, and lack of substance to the arguments for fetal rights, I do not foresee a unanimous resolution in the near future.

Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Transaction Ethics,"I will argue that a transaction to which two parties give their informed consent to, coerced neither by each other nor by anyone else, and both are made better off without harming any third party can be viewed in two ways. Regarding single isolated transactions between individuals there is only one case, namely that of slavery, which would be considered exploitative and impermissible even if the guidelines above are satisfied. Yet, when one incorporates society and the effects produced by such transactions the guidelines stated above are not enough to ensure that others will not be exploited and one needs to take these effects into consideration.

Although most situations where two informed parties agree to a contract, un-coerced and better off afterwards without producing harm to anyone else, are permissible, there are cases for which these seemingly exhaustive principles still result in an ethically questionable transaction. One such case presented in class consisted of the example of a yacht owner, who comes across a dying person and offers to take them on board, thus saving their life, under the condition that they consent to become their slave. If the dying person agrees to this contract it is assumed that they will stay alive, that neither one has been coerced nor that any third party will be harmed. It seems that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this transaction. This may be true for any other isolated condition offered (which also saves the person's life, is informed, un-coerced and does not harm anyone else) but the fact that it involves a person submitting to slavery is what makes this particular case an act of exploitation, as well as impermissible, but above all else impossible. The first argument for this statement is the fact that this transaction violates the first condition of the agreement, namely that both parties will be better off. The certainly that the dying person is better off living as a slave rather than dead, is questionable on several grounds but most of all on the fact that submitting all your rights to one person gives that person the right to end your life whenever they please, thus not improving your condition from the initial one. Additionally it can be argued that the slave owner is himself certainly not better off considering the immorality of slavery and committing an immoral act clearly does not make a person better off.

What is more, a contract involving slavery is itself a contradiction and thus not possible. This is best explained by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in On the Social Contract where he shows that To renounce one's freedom is to renounce one's status as a man, the rights of humanity and even its duties. There is no possible compensation for nayone who renounces everything. Such a renounciation is incompatible with teh nature of man, and taking away all his freedom of will is taking away all morality from his actions. Finally, it is a vain and contradictory convention to stipulate absolute authority on one side and on the other unlimited obedience. Isn't it clear that one is in no way engaged toward a person from whom one has the right to demand everything, and doesn't this conditon alone-without equivaletn and without exchange-entail the nullification of the act? For what right would my slave have against me, since all he has belongs to me, and this right being mine, my right agai! nst myself is a meaningless word? (Rousseau 50). Thus the actual contract could never take place, and so there would be nothing that would make the previously stated case binding despite the inital reservations. In addition to this it seems that one cannot possibley sell oneself for the simple reason that one does not own oneself but is the actual thing to be sold or given. How does one alinate oneself from oneself? The self remains unchaged before and after the contract. One cannot give oneself for one does not belong to anyone in the first place and as stated above the very definiton fo the self entails indepandance. Therefore, slavery can under no circumstances be acepted as part of a contract that is anything but exploitative, imoral or impermissible. For these resons it is clear why law is obligated to forbid any contract that would involve slavery, thus protecting uninformed citizens from being taken advantage of in such cases. The main objecton to the instigation of such a law would be the reduciton of opportunity for the stranded person to save their life. Yet, it has been shown that a contract involving slavery results in the person being in a worse situation, and what is more is not even an option. Such a contract is in itslef not binding and the understanding of this fact eliminates the desire for it by the person who would otherwise have presented such an offer.

From this one could conclude that any transaction not involving slavery, to which both informed uncoersed parites have agreed to, will benefit from and do not harm anyone else is a valid trasaction that does not exploit any of its participants. But is this all that is necessary to make an act permissible? The several cases covered in this class that satisfy all the above mentioned conditions for consideration as non-exploitative are still questioned in regards to thier ethical permissibility. One example is that of the issue regarding surrogate motherhood. The fundamental act seemingly satisfies all the conditions needed for aceptance as a transaction that is not exploitative. Yet, the issue is far from being acepted as completely permissible ethically or legally. Such questions as discussed by Laura M. Purdy: Is paid surrogacy baby-selling? (94) will the practic harm the children? (95) or Elizabeth Anderson's concern that the act treats children and women's reproductive capacities as commodities (71) are ony a few issues that need to be resolved before surrogacy can be acepted as fully non-exploitative. The same can be said in regards to the question of oragn sale where the individual may benefit without harming others but in the long run this option may lead to poor communities being taken advantage of.

Only when one examines an issue in the braoder sense, which includes the effects produced on society in general does it become clear that the guidelines given above are not quite enough to make an action ethically permissible. Every action has a reaction and not only on its immediate surroundings but in a broader sense as well. Although a transaction that satisfies the guidelaines above may not immediately be of harm to any third party, when the act is as controversial as surrogate motherhood, organ sale or cloning, it becomes obvious that views on these acts influence the availablity of options for others and such questions neces! sarily need to be examined before one acepts an act as permissible both legally and ethically. Therefore an act that sattisfies the guideleines above can still be considered exploitative in regards to the non-immediate effects produced.",0,0,0,0,6998
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Basic Frameworks of Moral Justification and Hierarchy of Human Needs,"All of the three basic frameworks of moral justification -- Lockean libertarianism, Millian utilitarianism and Kantian hypothetical contract view -- deal with the relationship between individuals and the society, more specifically, between individual rights and social welfare. Libertarianism, which focuses on individual rights, views an individual as a separate circle, with boundaries which distant it from others; the whole society is filled with these circles (Railton 1/18). Utilitarianism, which focuses on social welfare, emphasizes society as a whole, with contribution from each individual. A good analogy for this model will be the movement of water drops. When two water drops meet each other, they merge into one big drop; and as more water drops are added in, the water volume grows as a whole. As for the hypothetical contract view, the one that I think most plausible combines individual rights with social welfare together. In such a society, individual rights and social welfare are balanced based on different stages of human needs, according to the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. My entire argument will start with pointing out disadvantages of the other two frameworks based on this hierarchy and comparing them to the hypothetical contract view, that I prefer. Then, I will modify some aspects of this view followed by the greatest difficulty that I find.

First of all, I will introduce the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is usually depicted as a pyramid with five levels of needs. From the very lowest bottom to the top, it consisted of physiological need, the need for safety, the need for love and belongings, the need for esteem and the need for actualization. The four lower levels are usually in the group of deficiency needs, while the top level is called the growth need. Maslow argued that the higher needs can only be met when the lower needs are mainly or completely satisfied, just as climbing the ladder (Wikipedia Encyclopedia). I will discuss utilitarianism, libertarianism and the hypothetical contract view, respectively, based on the first four levels of human needs, the deficiency needs, with the same sequence that Maslow offered.

There are two types of utilitarianism, radical egalitarian and non-egalitarian. The non-egalitarian utilitarianism will result in the abundance of social welfare and meet the most basic human need of the Maslow's hierarchy, the physiological need. This type of utilitarianism requires a certain degree of welfare redistribution in order to maximize the overall social utility, based on the diminishing marginal utility theory. In another words, the size of the social welfare pie will grow bigger through reallocating resources from the better well-off to the less well-off. However, this view does not assume each member of the society will get equal size of the social welfare pie. In fact, when this non-egalitarian utilitarianism becomes radical egalitarianism, it might remove human incentives and each individual will expect others to contribute more to the whole society. The Great Leap Forward movement, carried out by communism China about 40 years ago, is a good example of people losing working incentives, when almost everyone was assigned the same amount of salary no matter how much work they did.

After the first stage of human needs, the physiological need is met, utilitarianism cannot climb up the hierarchy to meet the second stage of human needs, the need for safety, which is a negative need, just as natural rights is negative rights. In another word, it is not a need to claim anything, but instead, it is a need to create a boundary and prevent others' interference. The need for safety includes private property and personal freedom. That is to say, the need for private property is the need to secure the safety for property and the need for personal freedom is the need to assure the non-interference in personal choices. The need for safety requires the recognition and realization of individual rights and the higher priority being given to these rights over social welfare. These are fundamental doctrines of libertarianism, which give the opposite priorities when compared to utilitarianism does.

However, just as Maslow's hierarchy shows, the need for safety can only be achieved after the physiological need is satisfied. Take freedom and personal choice, for example. People will not consider the option to go to college while they are still starving. Not to mention the private property. How can people imagine private property when they do not even have a place to live? Then why cannot libertarianism meet the physiological needs while utilitarianism can? This is mainly because libertarianism over emphasizes individual rights and under weights the inseparable relationship of individuals with the whole society. As Aristotle points out in his Politics, the ultimate happiness rests in the city, not in the household or village, the small units of the city. This is because city is the only form with self-sufficiency compared to the other two sub-units of a city (Aristotle Politics). Put his model of household and city in the modern context, the household refers to the individual while the city refers to the society. The relationship between the individual and the society is the relationship between the part and the whole which is like the arms and the body. When the body is dead, the arms can not longer function. Utilitarianism recognizes this intimate relationship between the individual and the society while libertarianism does not.

Just as utilitarianism has its limitation over the hierarchy of human needs, neither can libertarianism climb to the third stage of the hierarchy, the need for love and belongings. This is also because of the rigid boundaries that libertarianism creates between individuals which eventually lead to individualism and emotional poverty. In the social analysis, Habits of the Heart, Robert Bellah writes,

[w]e (Americans) strongly assert the value of our self-reliance and autonomy. We deeply feel the emptiness of a life without sustaining social commitments. Yet we are hesitant to articulate our sense that we need one another as much as we need to stand alone, for fear that if we did, we would lose our independence altogether (Bellah 151).

As he points out, individualism, caused by radical libertarianism, will ultimately lead people to emotional emptiness and loneliness, because people are afraid of losing their independence. The data from Robert Putman's analysis, Bowling Alone, shows that the number of Americans' civil participation, political participation and church participation all dropped dramatically from the post World War II period to the early 1990s. Bellah attributes these declines to the spread of individualism within the American society. Thus, libertarianism has already failed in the climbing process to the third level of human needs.

The first reason why I think the hypothetical contract view is most plausible is because it balances individual rights with social welfare according to different stages of human needs. The second of Rawl's two principals of justice, which are parts of the hypothetical contract view, argue that everyone should be provided with equal opportunity to start off in the society, but without removing human incentive, since it does not assume radical equality among people just as non-egalitarian utilitarianism (Sterba 54). Through requiring a veil of ignorance depending on general circumstances what rules we'd choose in an original position of equality (Railton 6), the hypothetical contract is formed according to the real social needs at that specific social circumstance. For example, in a state of lower social abundance, social welfare might have priority over individual rights(Railton 6); while in a state of social abundance, individual rights should not be sacrificed for the greater social welfare (Railton 1/25).

Moreover, the hypothetical contract view creates a harmonic and interdependent relationship between the individual and the society, which enables people to pursue the third stages of the hierarchy of needs, the need for belonging and love. This is because this view makes the individual rights and social welfare compatible with each other and permits personal boundary, but bridged with common interests and human relationship. A good analogy is the relationship between two hands. Most of the time, they have their own sphere or space by resting at the two sides of the body. However, when carrying a heavy object, two hands will hold together for greater strength. In the case of the individual and the society, everyone is the individual being with his or her own sphere, but they can also be interdependent to build a better society. During this process, they will feel belonging and love.

Next, I want to modify the scope for the veil of ignorance. Recognizing the different stages of human needs in different societies and different values towards the same level of needs, I think the veil of ignorance should be regional rather than universal. An example of different stages of human needs can be seen through Europe and some African countries. To most western Europeans, freedom might be the essential requirement of life, while to many Africans still living under the poverty line, freedom might not be as important as their daily physiological needs. Hence, under the veil of ignorance, the priority should be given to social welfare over individual freedom in those societies. Next, I want to discuss different values towards the same level of needs from people of different cultural or religious background. Take different values towards the need for safety, for example. The majority Americans might value the freedom to live as part of the need for safety, but some extreme religious cults might value religious piousness as the need for safety. One of the extreme examples is that killing other people is regarded as immoral to many Americans. However, to some religious people, killing or conquering people who do not believe in the same religion or pagans is regarded as righteous warfare guided by God. For the case of some Muslim cults, it is called jihad, the sixth Pillar of Islam (Kynsh). By honoring God through warfare, they can be brought closer to God and thus, feel safety secured by God. Therefore, the original position behind the veil of ignorance should be considered by the people who are living under those specific social circumstances, including aspects of the welfare level, religious and cultural background.

The greatest difficulty I find with this the hypothetical contract view is the following: even within the same social conditions, humans might also have levels of needs. Some people might still be at the first stage of needs, physiological needs, while someone else might already have reached the fourth stage, the need for self-esteem. According to Rawl's two principles of justice, the social redistribution should provide the highest level of equal rights, opportunity to the least well-off groups (Course Pack 6). Then how do we assure that everyone is willing to climb up the hierarchy of needs? What if some people just want to stay at the bottom of the hierarchy of needs? For example, the welfare queen in the U.S. completely lives on government subsidy for their children and not values self-fulfillment, self-reliance even if they have the capability of well-being. Some justification for these behaviors could be that being exposed to such a critical condition as struggling for survival, these people are not able to perceive other higher levels of human needs yet. In this case, how long should the whole society wait for those people to catch up? Or should the society set a deadline for them in order to push them to climb up the hierarchy ladder.

I have analyzed the advantages of the hypothetical contract view based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs and have come to the conclusion that this view itself can promote people to the third level of the hierarchy for needs. This is mainly because it combines individual rights and social welfare, which are not compatible in the first two models. Nevertheless, this view cannot help people to achieve the fourth level of needs, the need for esteem, mainly because no compulsory rules in this social contract to push everyone to climb up the hierarchy ladder. Also, I have realized that the scope for the veil of ignorance should be limited, rather than universal. However, my entire argument is based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is not universally accepted. His model is mainly based on the biological needs or creature nature (common among the entire animal kingdom), rather than morality (a unique feature of human beings). Therefore, my entire argument regarding these three basic frameworks of moral justification is not based on morality, instead it based on some evolutionary history for human needs. In other words, it is biological rather than moralistic. This might not seem plausible to some people.",0,0,6.31,4.53,13088
Philosophy,Argumentative Essay,Undergraduate,Topic 1: Locke on Primary and Secondary Qualities,"In the late 1600s, John Locke set out to establish knowledge of the existence of an external world on the basis of empirical perception. To achieve this goal, Locke presented a series of observations regarding sensory experience that he felt were best explained by supposing the existence of an external world that resembled our perception of it in terms of the primary qualities of bodies. Then, by the principle of inference to the best explanation, Locke concluded that we have knowledge of such a world because the best explanation for a body of empirical data is likely to be true. Although Locke's argument is by definition invalid, it is inductively strong because its premises are true by inference to the best explanation, make it very unlikely for its conclusion to be false.

In order to comprehend Locke's epistemological argument, we must first develop an understanding of the concepts central to this argument. Locke uses the term bodies to refer to objects occurring in nature (Locke 1690, 197). Bodies are characterized by their qualities, or attributes, which have the power to cause ideas in the mind (Locke 1690, 197). ""Ideas, in turn, are defined as perceptions of bodies in the mind (Locke 1690, 197). Qualities are further described as either primary or secondary (Locke 1690, 198). Primary qualities are intrinsic attributes of bodies that do not depend on perception or the existence of any other thing (Locke 1690, 197-198). Secondary qualities, on the other hand, are relational attributes that produce various sensations in perceivers (Locke 1690, 198).

Having defined these terms, Locke presents an inductively strong argument that establishes the reliability of our ideas of the primary qualities of bodies. The first premise of the argument begins with a series of observations that, when carried to the logical conclusions, are best explained by the existence of an external world in which bodies accurately represent ideas in respect to their primary qualities.

Locke's first observation is that sensory experiences are produced by something than the sense organs (Locke 1690, 202). Locke argues that, if sensory experiences were caused by the senses, then individuals would be able to produce whatever sensory experience they desired in any situation (Locke 1690, 202). Individuals would therefore be able to produce the smell of roses in a barren field in the middle of winter. As this is impossible, Locke rejects the premise that sensory experiences are caused by the senses. However, the existence of sensory experiences necessitates a cause. Locke therefore concludes that the best explanation for this cause is the existence of bodies external to the mind (Locke 1690, 202). For instance, the most convincing explanation for the taste of a pineapple is eating a pineapple that actually exists external to the mind (Locke 1690, 202).

The second observation that Locke offers in support of his conclusion is that certain sensory experiences seem uncontrollable (Locke 1690, 203). Locke begins by distinguishing between two types of ideas: ideas that are caused by the mind when the senses are inactive and ideas that appear before the mind when the senses are active (Locke 1690, 203). In a state of sensory deprivation, Locke claims that it is possible to produce and dispose of ideas in the mind at will (Locke 1690, 203). Locke therefore argues that, if all ideas were caused by the mind, individuals should have complete control of their ideas in all situations. When our senses are active, however, we lose control of our ideas (Locke 1690, 203). For instance, it is impossible to dispose of the idea of light while staring directly at the sun. It is therefore impossible for all ideas to be caused by the mind. As there must be a cause for these ideas, Locke concludes that the best explanation for the cause is a world external to the mind (Locke 1690, 203).

Locke's third observation is that certain sensory experiences are frequently accompanied by vivid feelings such as pain or pleasure (Locke 1690, 203). If these experiences were caused in the mind, Locke argues, then thinking of them should cause pain (Locke 1690, 203). For example, an individual should feel pain when thinking of cutting his finger. Recalling these experiences does not cause pain, however, so it must be the case that they were caused by something other than the mind (Locke 1690, 203). Once again, Locke concludes that the best explanation for the cause of these painful experiences is the existence of a world external to the mind (Locke 1690, 203).

The fourth and final observation is that there is a great deal of internal coherence among sensations of the difference senses (Locke 1690, 203). For example, an individual that sees a fire can confirm his visual sensation by placing his hand in the fire and feeling the pain associated with burns. Alternatively, a basketball both appears and feels round. Locke concludes that this coherence is best explained by supposing that the qualities of objects are regular in the same manner that sense experience is regular (Charlow 2008, 2)

In the second premise of the argument, Locke proposes that the best explanation for his observations is that our experiences are caused by bodies external to the mind that resemble the ideas they produce in us with respect to their primary qualities (Joyce 2008). In the third premise, Locke makes use of inference to the best explanation and concludes his argument by stating, with a high degree of probability, that our experiences are caused by bodies external to the mind that resemble the ideas they produce in us with respect to their primary qualities (Joyce 2008).

Locke's ultimate goal in this argument is to establish knowledge in the existence of an external world that resembles our perception of that world. To strengthen his case, Locke distinguishes between primary and secondary qualities. Locke argues that our knowledge of the external world depends on our perception, which is a function of the qualities that objects possess. However, not all perception is reliable, as is the case with secondary qualities. Locke argues that our perception of secondary qualities is unreliable for three reasons.

First, Locke argues that that our ideas of secondary qualities such as cold and heat are falsely represented as positive qualities (Locke 1690, 197). In reality, these qualities simply represent the absence of some other quality, as cold is the absence of heat (Locke 1690, 197). We fail to make this distinction and falsely believe that these qualities are actually in a body, without taking notice of the causes that produce them (Locke 1690, 197). Secondly, conditions such as colorblindness demonstrate the ways in which our perception of secondary qualities depends on the functioning of our perceptual system, rather than the qualities that are actually intrinsic to bodies (Charlow 2008, 2). Finally, although secondary qualities are relational, we perceive them as intrinsic (Charlow 2008). The yellow color of a banana exists in relation to light, yet is perceived as a quality that is actually in bananas. Therefore, secondary qualities do not accurately represent the qualities that exist in bodies, and cannot be used to support the existence of an external world.

Locke's argument for the existence of an external world that reflects our perception of primary qualities is inductively strong because its premises are true by inference to the best explanation, making it very unlikely that its conclusion is false. Whether or not we accept Locke's argument as true depends on our criteria for knowledge. Locke's reasoning would certainly not satisfy Descartes' call for justified, true belief. I, on the other hand, believe that inference to the best explanation is sufficient for knowledge. It has been shown that each of Locke's premises, including his four observations, withstand the test inference to the best explanation. Thus, we can know that an external world exists, as well as the nature of such a world, simply by perceiving the primary qualities of bodies. Our perception of primary qualities—but not secondary qualities—can therefore be known to be reliable.",73.71,40.65,19.78,16.06,8220
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,George Schlesinger and Pascal's Wager,"George Schlesinger addresses several major objections to Pascal's famous wager. Although he doesn't consider either of these the gravest objection, he first defends the wager against the common aversion to its seemingly mercenary nature and the concern that the wagerer is not achieving the essence of religion. His argument that an appeal to greed is acceptable could be strengthened, and he fails to adequately account for how the bettor acquires genuine belief in God, which, I will argue, is necessary to the essence of religion.

According to Pascal, it is necessary for all people to make a decision between two options: God is, or He is not. In the famous wager argument, since one is forced to bet one way or the other, it is in one's best interest to bet in favor of God's existence because if you gain, you gain all. If you lose, you lose nothing (Pascal III, 233). A common objection, which has no great logical force but carries considerable psychological weight (Schlesinger 83), is that the wager seems to be mercenary and even impious. Simply betting on God because one has nothing to lose by it hardly seems the sort of behavior a perfectly good being would endorse. C.S. Lewis, although in reaction to a different proposition, also sums up this particular objection to Pascal's wager. When I respond to that appeal I seem to myself to be a thousand miles away from Christ. If I am sure of anything I am sure that His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities (Lewis 120) 3

Schlesinger's response to this distaste is that we are free to assume that no objective is ever hallowed enough that it should be impermissible to reach it by anything but impeccable means (Schlesinger 84). He suggests that even the noblest action, such as donating vast sums of money to charity, could conceivably contain an element of, or even be totally motivated by, greed. The person who takes that approach must admit that every act that fulfills some wish is selfish, which is manifest nonsense; therefore, the pursuit of a quest cannot be called deplorable simply because it is open to the accusation of greed. Furthermore, due to the exalted nature of the reward of belief in God, desiring that kind of pleasure is to be acclaimed. Therefore, even if one is (at least initially) totally motivated by this sort of greed, it is actually a noble greed and not offensive.

Schlesinger is correct that we are free to assume that the religious seeker needn't be expected to reach God by impeccable means. Indeed, if the doctrine of the sinfulness of all mankind is correct, that would be impossible. This argument that suspicion of greed in betting on God (because of a selfish wish for acquiring an eternal reward for oneself) necessarily leads to suspicion of every act fulfilling some wish, however, seems to be a slippery slope. At least, it is possible to claim that seeking God for such reasons debases the individual (because they are, in fact, not seeking God but rather eternal reward merely for personal benefit), which Schlesinger admits is a reasonable cause for calling a pursuit deplorable. After all, the desire for eternal reward is easily independent of the one who offers it. Samuel Butler jokingly pointed out, An apology for the Devil: It must be remembered that we have only heard one side of the case. God has written all the books. If the devil also had his say and theoretically had the power to offer eternal reward in his kingdom to those following his ways, why not bet on him? This, in turn, is a potentially damaging response to the idea that greed for God's reward is noble.

I think a better defense against the feelings of distaste involves a reflection on the nature of the wager. Although it was not published, Pascal is appealing to his (apparently intended) audience solely in terms of their greed. If one grants the assumption that impeccable means aren't compulsory and that there is hope even for people (at least initially) motivated only by greed to reach God, Pascal's is reasonable target. No other type of argument but an appeal to greed could possibly reach them, and Pascal's goal is not outlining the ideal path to religious belief (if such a thing exists) but rather offering the only possible beginning that type of person could take. His wager can be seen as a way to initially reach his audience through a motivation common to virtually all people, one which for some is their exclusive motivation. By showing that the search for God is worthwhile even merely in terms of greed, his audience can conceivably begin that quest solely on that basis. Pascal intends and expects the ensuing search to transform people in such a way that they acquire noble traits and motivations, enabling them to come to believe in God for other reasons as well. They will become fidéle, honnête, humble, reconnaissant, bienfaisant, ami sincère, véritable 1 (Pascal III 233). As a result, not only is Pascal's approach acceptable for this purpose but quite possibly the only kind he could have taken.

Betting on God may be the manifestation of a noble greed that is to be acclaimed (Schlesinger 85), but is simply putting one's money on God's existence sufficient? This seems to be the unstated objection Schlesinger replies to when he points out that the essence of true religion is not the intellectual assent to a set of propositions (Schlesinger 85). Even the demons believe (James 2:15); yet clearly their intellectual belief in God does not grant them divine approval. Instead, the essence of religion is having one's heart and soul virtually consumed by a deep reverence and love of God (Schlesinger 85). Many religious thinkers and philosophers have said that such a love comes only from obedience to God's commands. For this reason, according to Schlesigner, Pascal's advice to bet on God and generate this state of mind through desirable behavior is not only appropriate but possibly absolutely indispensable for achieving the essence of religion.

The problem with this response is that true belief is more than intellectual assent, not less. True religion surely involves a love of God, whose development may necessitate fulfillment of religious practices, but love of God or obedience to His commands without belief in God, while crucial, is not sufficient and also seems to be nonsensical. Schlesinger claims that behaving in accordance with religious rules before having acquired actual belief provides the proper grounds on which fervent love for the Divine may grow. Love for the divine, however, is not the same as belief in the divine. As a result, through this response Schlesinger does not provide an adequate account of how belief in God is obtained.

Pascal himself claims that the bettor can actually indirectly control his beliefs through such religious behavior, for çela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. In other words, Pascal's mechanism for obtaining belief demands deadening of the faculties that make us human. Schlesinger fails to defend his claim that such an approach could lead to genuine belief (Schlesinger 84). In fact, he later goes on to say that belief is obtained through compelling arguments or credible evidence, but does not reconcile this with the notion that the one who wagers on God must deaden his very ability to respond to arguments or evidence.

Schlesinger argues that betting on God cannot be called deplorable simply based on its openness to the accusation of greed; however, one might reply that it can be called wrong because it demands belief based on something other than epistemic reasons. In other words, the person who bets on God does not do so because he thinks that God actually exists, but rather for a perceived benefit to himself, and deadens his reason in order to do so. Perhaps that should not offend religious proprieties, but it should offend intellectual integrity.

But is our intellectual integrity more important than acquiring belief in one's own salvation, consolation, or enjoying the religious life, which, as Pascal claims, is the best kind of life? I can see no scientific or logical reason not to seek consolation by adjustment of our beliefs-only a moral one, a point of honor (Weinberg 260). I think the point of honor at stake, however, is a very important one. To believe something without seeking to know whether it is true is not really belief. I happen to think that the religious conservatives [who believe in what they believe because it is true] are wrong in what they believe, but at least they have not forgotten what it means to really believe something (Weinberg 257). No matter how attractive Christianity's message of salvation is, no honest man should believe it if he does not think it gives a true account of the nature of the universe. And God, particularly the Christian view of him as omniscient and omnipresent, is not mocked. Indeed, Demosthenes, the Greek orator, wrote that what we have in us of the image of God is the love of truth and justice. If the noble greed Schlesinger describes manifests itself in the abandonment of this love of truth (through obedience to uninvestigated demands of faith), I think this shows it was not really noble. To fail in seeking truth by deadening the faculties that make us human in order to believe what we want to be true for our own salvation is simply wrong. And even if it were not wrong, the omniscient God the wagerer bets on is unlikely to be deceived by it.

I also think it is unlikely for the bettor himself to be deceived by it. However we may labour for our own deception, truth, though unwelcome, will sometimes intrude upon the mind (Samuel Johnson). Unless a person can truly render himself beastlike, they will not be completely immune to genuine arguments and evidence regarding the question of God's existence. And unless they sincerely grapple with that question, their belief is based on a foundation of sand, in danger of destruction from any rain and wind.",0,17.83,5.42,7.75,10017
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Aristotle on Friendship,"In Books VIII and IX of the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle creates a treatise on friendship. His treatment of friendship is a comprehensive one and, while it raises a number of questions that need clarification, it ultimately is strong and comprehensive enough to give us an understanding of friendship sufficient for the further study of ethics. In this paper I will explain Aristotle's theory of friendship and show where he leaves gaps that need to be filled.

Aristotle defines friendship in the Rhetoric and similarly the NE 1. In the Rhetoric he says:

We will begin by defining friendship and friendly feeling. We may describe friendly feeling towards anyone as wishing for him what you believe to be good things, not for your own sake but for his, and being inclined, so far as you can, to bring these things about. A friend is one who feels thus and excites these feelings in return. 2

In general, we might describe it as a relationship involving a mutual active interest and part in the welfare of the other. He distinguishes friendship from two similar types of relationships, goodwill and unanimity, which involve no established relationship and no internal drive.

Aristotle classifies friendship into three kinds: character-based (CB), advantage-based (AB), and pleasure-based (PB). CB friendships-the ideal case-have their foundation in mutual admiration of parts or all of the other person's character. Each friend admires one or more virtues in the other. The virtues need not be mutual; for example, I may admire my friend's intelligence and he may admire my kindness, whether or not we disagree on other things. Aristotle considers this to be the best kind of friendship, and when both friends are virtuous, the perfect friendship. CB friendships are the most permanent of the three kinds because one's character is relatively stable, whereas one's advantageous opportunities or taste in pleasures are not.

Aristotle argues that CB friendships are the best because the friends do this by reason of their own nature and not incidentally; therefore their friendship lasts as long as they are good-and excellence is an enduring thing. 3 This is consistent with Aristotle's views on virtue in the rest of the NE. It suggests that these friendships can only take place between adults who have been habituated to virtue and have a correct understanding of the good. Aristotle acknowledges this immediately: But it is natural that such friendships should be infrequent; for such men are rare. 4 But this seems somewhat problematic: can't adolescents (still prone to their passions) have mutual admiration of virtues in one another? The test suggests that Aristotle would say no, because young people cannot yet practically understand virtue: …for he in inexperienced in the actions that occur in life…and further, since he tends to follows his passions, his study will be vain and unprofitable…it makes no difference whether he in young in years or youthful in character…For to such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit… 5 But these relationships do seem to occur in the real world. In this respect, Aristotle's model of the ideal case of friendship is good but may not be definitive.

The other two cases are considered friendships only by way of their resemblance to the ideal case (CB)-that is, they are relationships which include mutual well-wishing and well-doing, but each friend is concerned more with his own personal gain than with his friend's, and in this respect they are incomplete. Personal pleasure is at the root of PB friendships, and personal utility (usefulness) is at the root of AB friendships. Since personal gain is their foundation, they are transitory, subject to disputes, and limited in their well-wishing and -doing.

These friendships are limited in that they are not other-centered, but self-centered. Thus, these friends have their own gain in mind rather than the other friend's gain, and will tend to wish- and do-well only if the benefits to them exceed the costs to them. In a CB friendship, each friend is much more willing to wish- and do-well for the other because he is focused on his friend's gain from the friendship instead of his own. And each is good without qualification and to his friend, for the good are both good without qualification and useful to each other. So too are they pleasant… 6

John Cooper argues7 that although these kinds occur only incidentally (as opportunities arise), they eventually involve mutual well-wishing and -doing; thus, Aristotle is justified in classifying them as friendships. Cooper notes, too, that if these other kinds didn't count as friendships, then friendships would be an extremely rare form of relationship. If Aristotle's work is to have any practical use, he needs to extend his notion of friendship to kinds not based solely on virtue.

The first of these is AB friendship. This type rests upon the utility of a partnership to each friend, and is formed because each partner is useful to the other. He argues that since old people seek usefulness, these friendships will predominate among them. These friendships also occur often between business partners and those united in a common effort. They dissolve as soon as one person is no longer useful to the other, for [those friends] were lovers not of each other but of profit. 8

Aristotle follows this consistently, granting that any men, whether good or bad, can have an AB friendship in their desire for profit. But there seems to be a problem that arises between Cooper and Aristotle: if mutual well-wishing and well-doing develops within an AB friendship, what happens when the friendship is no longer profitable? Aristotle says it dissolves-but this is hard to see on Cooper's interpretation. It doesn't seem right that an established relationship between two people, whether business partners or elderly people, should end as soon as it is no longer profitable. We would rather say that it becomes past its prime, or even goes into a state of acquaintanceship (which we might consider a state of knowing, but of little or no well-wishing and certainly no well-doing). Aristotle concedes that we ought to make some allowance for our former friendship, 9 but this applies only after the friendship has ended. The unclear point is whether, on Cooper's interpretation, any relationship can or should continue at all.

The last main kind is PB friendship. Founded on the ability of the relationship to increase each person's pleasure, PB friendships are more like the ideal case than AB friendships, because the friends enjoy each other's company (not necessarily part of the AB case). In this respect, the friends enjoy either something about the other's character (e.g. wittiness) or performing an activity together (e.g. exercising). This kind of friendship predominates among young people, who seek passion and pleasure.

These friendships also need not include just good men, as each friend loves the pleasure he gets from the relationship, not the other friend himself. These friendships are most permanent when both friends enjoy the same activities or qualities in each other. They are then least permanent when the opposite is true, and this is obvious from our experience in real life: if my friend enjoys bowling and I enjoy playing blackjack, and we have only passing interests in each other's activities, then our friendship will be only a passing one.

As young people live under the guidance of emotion, 10 their pleasures change quickly and thus their friendships change quickly. Aristotle is right in attributing these friendships mostly to young people. The same problem with Cooper's interpretation, however, also arises in this case: we see young people changing friends all the time, but it's difficult to say that their friendships actually dissolve.11

Aristotle puts some qualifications on his distinction in general. First, the three main kinds are able to shift their bases; that is, a PB friendship can become an AB friendship, and so on with all three cases. His theory suggests that a friendship need not have the same basis in common (e.g. one gets pleasure from the other, who gets utility from the first), although this type of relationship may be quite unstable. Aristotle also restricts the amount of well-wishing and well-doing that can occur in the relationship. In a CB friendship friends admire each other's character and wish their virtue to increase; however, one would not wish his friend so well that his virtue increased to the level of his becoming a god. Since gods and men cannot be friends the way Aristotle means, too much active interest would effectively dissolve their friendship. Not to be mistaken as jealousy, this restriction on active interest seems to reflect our actual attitude toward friendships.

It seems, then, that Aristotle's distinction of the three main kinds of friendship is justified, albeit sometimes rough around the edges. This is not atypical of the NE; in I.7, he makes clear that, since ethics is a practical science, we need not look for precision in all things alike, but in each class of things such precision as accords with the subject-matter, and so much as is appropriate to the inquiry. 12 Although we would like to know more about his distinction, the explanation he provides is sufficient to proceed with his theory of friendship.

The second part to Aristotle's explanation-mostly located in NE IX-is a set of arguments for why friendship is an essential component of the good life. Aristotle argues for this in four different ways, which, I believe, amount to a comprehensive treatment of the question.

First, Aristotle considers friends to be a type of external goods13-indeed, the greatest external goods possible. External goods are necessary to the good life because they are preconditions or instruments for virtuous action. (For example, one can only exercise sexual temperance if he is physically attractive enough to be sexually desirable.) And if, as he implies, friends are greater than, say, good fortune or divine intervention, then no further discussion is necessary. He argues this point in two ways. First, it seems strange, when one assigns all good things to the happy man, not to assign friends, who are thought the greatest of external goods. 14 His point is better taken rhetorically than logically, because he is arguing from the endoxa; logically: if friends are thought to be the greatest external goods, then they are greater than good fortune (i.e. they are the greatest external goods). He also argues in the same thread that we need friends in both fortune and adversity: in adversity, to confer benefits on us, and in fortune, to share our blessings with other people. And if we need friends in good fortune, then having friends is an essential part of the good life.

The first claim is unsupported: if I have all other external goods but friends, and I live virtuously, it seems possible that I can be happy without friends. His second claim is more substantial: if we have good fortune, then we can exercise the virtue of liberality by conferring benefits on friends. And we can't opt out of exercising that virtue if it is available, because that would not be choosing the good life (since a better life is available). Friends can also help us through adversity: if we can't perform virtuous acts, we can at least share in theirs and contemplate them. This is a stronger case for needing friends as part of the good life.

Second, Aristotle believes that friendship is itself an excellence or virtue: it is the excellence of living well with others. Since man is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others, 15 then the excellence of this activity is living well with others. And since plainly it is better to spend [one's] days with friends and good men than with strangers or any chance persons, 16 it follows that it is an excellence of man to live well with friends.

This argument-Aristotle's strongest of the four-also necessitates the possession of friends in the good life. If man's nature is indeed to live with others, then it would seem impossible to live the good life without friends. It would actually be going against our nature, and that (obviously) precludes the possibility of living excellently.

Third, he argues as follows that friends allow for a state of continuous happiness17:

1. P. Happiness is an activity. 2. P. The good man's activity is virtuous. 3. P. A thing's being one's own makes it pleasant. 4. P. We can contemplate our neighbors and their actions better than ourselves and our own (by way of having a more objective view of them). 5. P. Actions of virtuous men are pleasant to good men (because friends share in their friends' actions). 6. C. Then we can contemplate and share in virtuous activity at the same time, and almost all the time. 7. C. Then our happiness can be continuous.
Aristotle believes that friends are other selves and that we share in their activity. In this way, we can constantly be either contemplating virtuous activity or participating in it, or both.

This leads to a great amount of happiness and makes friends highly desirable in the good life, but it does not necessitate having friends. It seems plausible that I can spend a great deal of time doing virtuous acts myself and contemplating them, and I would be quite happy in this way. This argument would work if Aristotle had defined the good life as a state of continuous happiness, but this is not the case.

Finally, he argues that the happy man ought to live pleasantly. 18 That is, if friends are pleasant to us, and if we ought to live the good life, then it ought to be pleasant to us, and therefore we ought to have friends. This argument does not support the claim that friends are essential, but rather that they are only highly desirable.

The first two arguments support Aristotle's thesis that friends are essential, but the second only serve to convince us that they are desirable. As such, we might read this section as rather a set of arguments for a weaker claim-why we ought to have friends-rather than the stronger claim of necessity. However, Aristotle does not describe the good life as the best possible life for an individual; it is rather that life which is most desirable-the highest human good. On this interpretation, it is possible understand Aristotle's two arguments for great desirability as arguments for necessity.

It is important to note two things. First, Aristotle argues that there is a natural limit to the number of friends one can have.19 The limit makes sense, because plainly one reaches a point where he can no longer maintain strong friendships with so many people. Second, Aristotle claims in the same paragraph (and without argument) that love tends to be a sort of excess friendship, and that can only be felt towards one person. The lack of an argument raises plenty of questions about this claim, of which I have no room for discussion here.

It would seem, then, that Aristotle's model of friendship is a good one, at least for the purposes of his study of ethics. It is consistent with the rest of the NE, and it does not try to define any hard and fast rules about friendship. The flexibility and (somewhat) open-endedness of this account is what makes it applicable to the many different types of friendship situations. Or, at the very least, it provides a strong starting-ground for further discussion of friendship.",0,0,0,5.67,15515
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Explaining Locke's Primary and Secondary Qualities,"In his Essay Concerning Human Understanding 1, John Locke makes a distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of objects. For Locke, primary qualities (PQ's) are those accidents (or properties) of objects that inhere in the objects themselves in whatever state they are. He claims, problematically, they are utterly inseparable from the body, 2 both physically and conceivably. To clarify: changing a primary quality means changing the object itself. Secondary qualities (SQ's) are those accidents whose existence depends on both (a) an object's primary qualities and (b) a perceiving agent's perception of the SQ. Therefore, they do not themselves inhere in objects; rather, SQ's are powers inhering in objects which produce ideas of the SQ's in us. Changing a SQ does not change the object itself. Locke's purpose in making this distinction is to refute the Medieval Aristotelian theory that all qualities equally inhere in their respective objects. My design is to explain this distinction and Locke's arguments in support of it, and then consider the problematic case of solidity as a primary quality.

I. Defining the Distinction
Locke names the following as a complete list of PQ's3: solidity, extension (i.e. bulk, or size), figure (i.e. shape), number, situation (i.e. spatial location) and motion (or rest). An incomplete list of SQ's includes: colors, sounds, smells, tastes, feels, etc. And powers of objects to produce change in other objects he also considers SQ's.

We must first consider what it is for PQ's to be in the objects themselves, 4 as Locke claims they are. What Locke means by this is that a quality must be so much a part of its object that the object cannot be physically separated from, or even conceived of without, the quality. He gives the example of a grain of wheat: no matter what one might do to break it or alter it, the grain (or each new piece) still has the property of having shape, size, number, a spatial location, etc. These qualities are so intimately connected with the grain as to actually be required by the grain's existence.

Note that the manifestations of particular PQ's may change. The grain may have been split in two; it may have fallen on the floor, or been set into motion at some point. But at no point in changing the manifestations of the PQ's were the grain pieces separated from having PQ's. This is what Locke means by in the objects themselves.

Locke also explains how PQ's produce ideas of themselves in us. He holds that bodies can only produce ideas in us by impulse-that is, they send out imperceptible bodies which are received by the concerned senses. The senses transmit this motion to the brain, which produces ideas in us of the PQ's. He further maintains that those ideas resemble the PQ's perceived by our senses because PQ's exist in objects whether perceived or not.

Locke's claim that PQ's are inseparable from their objects creates a problem, though, upon considering Descartes' heated piece of wax.5 As I touch the pliable wax, its shape is altered by the pressure of my fingers. This is clearly a case of changing its PQ's, but we would not say that it is no longer a piece of wax. Non-rigid states of matter (e.g.: liquids, gases, and even pliable solids) have either no distinct shape or a constantly changing one. Locke might respond to such an objection by making an ad hoc exception for these cases' not needing shape, or he might modify his theory in the following way.

Locke may want to say here that PQ's can be determined in ranges, rather than absolutes. For example, every snowflake has a unique shape; yet we wouldn't say that there is only one snowflake shape. Or consider that I change the shape of a piece of paper by folding it. We wouldn't say that it is a new object, but rather that it is the same object with a different shape. But if we modify Locke's theory to include a natural range of possible shapes (or, more extensively, PQ alterations), it seems to better fit the way we understand objects.

Nonetheless, let us consider his SQ's. SQ's are not in the objects themselves. This is obvious from their partial dependence on being perceived. Rather, SQ's are powers inherent in objects and are conveyed by means of the PQ's. The color blue is just an object's power in virtue of its PQ's to produce an idea of blue in a perceiver. Note that this also depends on the perceiver's ability to see the color blue, so blue cannot be in objects themselves. SQ's are just powers of objects to produce certain ideas in us.

Locke further claims that SQ's work on us by the motion of insensible particles to our senses, and that God connects the ideas of SQ's to the particles so that we may perceive them correctly. This differs from the way we perceive ideas of PQ's. PQ ideas resemble their PQ's and need no divine connection. SQ ideas do not resemble their powers, but rather are caused by the powers. For example, the idea of a sound bears no resemblance to a power to make air vibrate, etc. Whereas PQ ideas have a resemblance relationship with their originals, SQ ideas have a causal relationship with their powers.

II. Analysis of Arguments Supporting the Distinction
Locke makes the following four arguments that support, with varying degrees of success, his distinction between PQ's and SQ's. His first two arguments seem to lead to problematic conclusions, but his second two arguments support his distinction more strongly.

The first of these is the Pain Argument6. Heat being an example of a secondary quality (feel), the argument goes like this:

 P. At a distance from a fire we perceive heat. P. Up close to a fire we perceive pain. P. Pain is obviously not in the fire. C. So heat is not in the fire either.
This argument is dubious in that it assumes that pain is an intense form of heat, which is not a sound assumption. Pain has the special property of not existing unfelt, whereas heat does not. Suppose there is a forest fire in an uninhabited part of Montana. Of course no one would feel any pain from it-but it doesn't seem right to claim that the fire isn't hot just because there are no people around. This argument doesn't provide much support for Locke's distinction.

Second is the Colors Argument7, which looks like this:

 P. With the lights on, we perceive a piece of porphyry to be red and white. P. With the lights off, we perceive the same object to be without color. C. So color itself cannot inhere in an object.
Our perception of the porphyry has changed without making any real changes to the porphyry itself. This argument can be dispensed with simply by putting a qualification on SQ's: enabling conditions.

Enabling conditions are necessary conditions external to an object and a perceiver that, only upon the fulfillment of which, allow a particular power to work. In this case, the enabling condition for red and white to be produced is a certain minimum level of light. In the case of a sound, the enabling conditions are that the object must be outside of a vacuum, etc. Granted this corollary, the Colors Argument loses its validity.

Locke's third argument suggests that the reader crush an almond8. The almond pieces still retain all the PQ's (solidity, extension, figure, etc.), but their SQ's have changed. The sweet taste has been lost and replaced by an oily taste, and similarly the white color has been replaced by a dirty color. From this we can gather that some qualities are part and parcel of their objects, while others are mutable. This, therefore, is Locke's first substantial justification of his distinction.

The fourth argument is the experiment in which one puts both a cold hand and a hot hand into the same lukewarm water.9 Each hand perceives a level of heat in the water contrary to that of the other hand. This argument is similar to the third, but stronger in that no changes are made to the object in question. Thus one is able to perceive simultaneously different SQ's from an object whose PQ's remain constant. Without a distinction between PQ's and SQ's, it should not be possible for some qualities to be perceived in contrary ways. This experiment shows that the Medieval Aristotelian theory is inconsistent, and provides further grounds for Locke's distinction.

III. The Problem of Solidity
The problem to which the heading of this section refers is Locke's placement of solidity in the category of PQ's. Solidity seems to exhibit signs of being a SQ, e.g.: melting an object changes its solidity without necessarily changing the object itself. Ice melts into water above 0°C, and water manifests different primary qualities than ice. This suggests that solidity, which is changeable, is not clearly a true PQ.

But solidity doesn't fit nicely as a SQ either. SQ's are powers dependent on both an object's PQ's and on a person's ability to perceive SQ's. It might make sense to say that solidity is a power of an object to produce ideas of degrees of solidity in us; however, we would then be forced to say that the solidity of an object also depends upon its being perceived. Like the forest fire example, this produces a very strange result.

Locke has two options for solving this problem. If he considers that a melted object is the same object as the original, even though its properties have changed, then solidity is a SQ. If solidity is a PQ, he would have to claim that an ice cube and, later, a melted puddle of water are the same object. He obviously chooses the first one, and that seems to be his best choice. We would naturally be more inclined to say that water and ice are the same object, messy as that may be, than to say that an object's solidity depends on its being perceived. Although this result is clearly not the definitive answer to the problem, it is consistent with Locke's theory and seems to be the lesser of two evils.

Thus, Locke's distinction carries some theoretical weight. It is by no means perfect, especially given the problems of inseparability and solidity, and it is still subject to criticism from a different angle by immaterialists like Berkeley. Nonetheless, the distinction has some good insights into how we understand the qualities of substances, and on that merit earns its place in his Essay.",0,0,9.4,12.54,10239
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,EXAMINING SOCRATES' DESIRE THEORY,"In the Meno Socrates argues that no one desires what is bad. I will first explain and evaluate the argument, then examine its implications for Socrates' view of human desire and action (namely, the view that akrasia is not possible) and explore the troubling aspects of this view.

Socrates begins by categorizing the following types of people:
(A) People who desire what they believe to be good things, where the things are actually good. (B) People who desire what they believe to be good things, where the things are actually bad. (C) People who desire what they believe to be bad things, thinking the things will benefit them. The things can be either good or bad. (D) People who desire what they believe to be bad things, where the things are actually bad. These people also believe the bad things will harm them. (77c-77d)

His aim is to show that this is a comprehensive description of peoples' beliefs and desires, and that in cases (A) through (C) it can be seen that people desire what they believe to be the good. In the case of (D), the goal is to prove that that sort of person does not exist. It seems that the above list includes all combinations of beliefs and desires, and that additional, more specific combinations of circumstances will fall under one of the categories. The task, then, is to prove that these people desire only good things, or that those who do not cannot exist.

It is easy to see that (A) and (B) are not problematic cases. People who clearly desire what they believe to be good things really do desire good things, regardless of whether they happen to be mistaken about whether or not a thing is good, as in case (B). People in (C) and (D) require a bit more explanation. A person in category (C) is using the word bad incorrectly to describe the object of his desires. If a person believes a thing to benefit him, then that thing cannot be believed (by him) to be bad. To think a thing is beneficial is to think it is good. A person cannot correctly believe a thing to be both bad and beneficial. Therefore, the person in (C) actually desires what he believes to be good, again regardless of whether the thing is actually good or bad. The people in (D) are correctly using the word bad to apply to the object of their desires, since they believe the harmful to be bad. To deal with these people, Socrates elicits from Meno the following assumptions:
(1) No one wants to be miserable and unhappy. (2) Harm to oneself makes one miserable and unhappy.  (78)

Socrates then concludes that group (D) does not exist, since those people, by desiring what they believe to be harmful (bad) things are desiring to be miserable and unhappy. No one wants to be miserable and unhappy, so no one desires what he believes to be bad. (A)-(C) actually desire what they believe to be good, and group (D) does not exist, so no one desires what he believes to be bad. I feel compelled to say here that although Socrates actually claims that no one…wants what is bad (78), what he means is that no one wants what he believes is bad. This is an important clarification to make, for otherwise (B) becomes a counterexample, which it is clearly not intended to be.

The argument seems to be valid if indeed the list of people covers all possible combinations of beliefs and desires, and it seems that it does. It also seems reasonable to say that bad things are not beneficial, that being beneficial automatically qualifies a thing as good. However, I am not so sure about assumption (1), No one wants to be miserable and unhappy. It seems that there are some instances where people actually do want to be miserable and unhappy. Consider the following case. Grace's fiancée has recently told her that he no longer wishes to get married, and in fact no longer wishes to have anything to do with her. Grace is devastated, and finds it difficult to carry on with her daily life. She spends a good part of her day in tears and has stopped eating. She is constantly remembering their time together, which only makes her feel worse. Grace realizes that when she thinks about their relationship she feels worse, but she continues to do so. She knows that if she stopped reliving every day of their time together she would start to feel better, but she chooses not to. She wants to be miserable and unhappy right now. She also knows that going out with her friends would cheer her up, but she is choosing not to do so, and choosing to remain miserable and unhappy instead. A case like this is not so far-fetched; in fact most people have probably been in a position like Grace's. Perhaps due to different circumstances, but it is not so hard to imagine a person wanting to be miserable and unhappy, at least for a time. This would mean, then, that there are people in group (D), who desire what they believe to be bad, knowing it will harm them, and that Socrates' conclusion is false.

Let us now turn to what the argument in the Meno tells us about Socrates' views of human action and desire. On his view, akrasia is not possible. This is because people only act to bring about what they desire, and so, since on Socrates' account people only desire what they believe to be good, it is not possible for a person not to do what he believes to be good. A person cannot believe that an action will be good for him, yet not do it. It seems also-although he does not explicitly argue for it-that he means to say people always not only do what they believe to be good, but what they believe to be best.

The first part of Socrates' view seems to be true. It is reasonable to say that a person's actions are always caused by his desires. It does not make sense to say that a person did something he did not want to do. Even if he did not perhaps desire to do this or that particular action, he desired for the state of affairs brought about by that action to obtain. What is troublesome about Socrates' view is that it does not seem to accurately describe the relationship between human actions and desires. There are many cases in which it seems that we do not do what we know to be best for us: dieters cheat on their diets, knowing it is best not to; students wait until the night before to study for exams, knowing it would be best to prepare in advance; smokers continue to light up, knowing it would be best to quit. It seems that in these cases pleasure satisfaction wins out over what is actually in a person's best interest. The dieter who eats half a cake is immediately gaining physical pleasure (for a short time anyway), rather than gaining what he knows to be better, good health. At that moment he desires physical pleasure more than good health, although he knows health to be best. Also, many dieters speak of lacking self-control, causing their diets to fail. This implies that they do indeed know what is best for them, yet they are unable to do it. So, it is feasible that we do not indeed desire what it best for us, or that we do not always do what we believe to be best for us. Plato is aware that we are not always able to do what we know to be best for us, and he addresses this in the Republic, by dividing the soul into parts, with each part desiring separate things.

Socrates' claim that no one wants what he believes to be bad is probably true for most people in most circumstances, but it does not appear to be true of all people at all times, as it seems that some people really do want to be miserable and unhappy, however briefly. Additionally, his view that akrasia is impossible seems to be contradicted by our everyday experiences, and therefore his theory of human action and desire is an incomplete account.",44.7,72.28,60.36,62.75,7649
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,PLEONEXIA,"In the first book of the Republic Socrates argues against Thrasymachus, by reference to pleonexia, that the just are good and clever and the unjust are ignorant and bad. (350c) I will examine his argument and attempt to show that it falls short. I will also discuss the way the notion of pleonexia contributes to Socrates' larger defense of Justice throughout the rest of the Republic, particularly in his definition of Justice and the explication of the just city, as opposed to the unjust city.

Thrasymachus holds that unjust people are clever and good, and that virtue and wisdom are included with injustice. Justice is not a vice for him, just very high-minded simplicity. (348c) Socrates attempts to refute this view by considering the kinds of people others try do outdo. His strategy is to prove that the clever and good are like the just and that the bad and ignorant are like the unjust, because of the types of people they try to outdo. Let us sketch the argument, beginning with the just person. He will try to outdo only unjust people, not just people or those who perform just actions; that is, he will try to outdo only those unlike himself. The unjust person, on the other hand, will try to outdo unjust and just alike; that is, those who are like and unlike himself.

Turning now to the clever and good person, we are helped to understand by way of example. A musical person is clever in music and tries to outdo only non-musicians (those unlike himself). Generalizing from this, we get that all knowledgeable people try to outdo only those unlike themselves. Since the knowledgeable are clever, and the clever are good, the clever and good person wants to outdo only those unlike himself. The ignorant person, as the opposed to the knowledgeable person, tries to outdo both those like and unlike himself (both the ignorant and the knowledgeable).

We can now see that the just are like the clever and good, in that they both try to outdo only those unlike themselves. The unjust are like the ignorant, because they try to outdo those who are like and unlike themselves. Both the just and the unjust have the qualities of the kinds of people they resemble. Therefore, the just person really is good and clever, and the unjust person really is bad and ignorant.

Now, it seems plausible enough that Socrates is correct about the attempted outdoing that goes on, but a few assumptions of his argument seem suspect. I am not at all sure why the clever are necessarily good, for are not the bad clever as well? We think thieves are bad, but they often pull off very clever robberies, and the same can be said for murderers, especially serial killers. Novels, movies, and television series all deal with elaborate thefts and murders. Think of Ten Little Indians, Ocean's 11, and CSI. Cleverness is not itself good or bad, and those who possess it are neither good nor bad because of it. Socrates could instead argue that the knowledgeable are good, but it does not seem that that is true, either. The musician is knowledgeable, but why should that make him good? He needs a way to show that the clever and good really are the knowledgeable, that they really do try to outdo only those unlike themselves.

Another problematic assumption is that one truly does have the qualities of those he resembles. Perhaps the just, like the clever and good, try to outdo only those unlike themselves. But why should this make the just clever and good? Say the good spend very little money, and the miserly spend very little money as well. This does not make the miserly good, or even like the good, at least not in any meaningful way. They are, of course, like the good in this one respect, but that similarity is not an indicator of the miser's goodness, which is what we care to discern. Likewise, why should the just person's resemblance to the good person with respect to pleonexia mean that the just person really is good?

The last problem I would like to discuss is the lumping together of the ignorant and the bad. Socrates has only argued that the unjust are like the ignorant, because they both try to outdo those like and unlike themselves. Although he has said that the bad and ignorant try to outdo everyone, he has not given a reason why that is so for the bad person, like he has for the ignorant person. He has said nothing to support the unjust being bad, or the ignorant being bad. Yet, he concludes that the unjust are like the ignorant and the bad. Ignorance in itself is not bad, for children are ignorant of many things, and we do not call them bad (not because they are ignorant, anyway). Without justification of why the ignorant are bad, I do not see how we can satisfactorily conclude what Socrates does.

Let us leave these considerations now, and turn to the matter of how the idea of pleonexia serves Socrates' interests throughout the rest of the Republic. In Book IV, Socrates gives a definition of justice in which pleonexia figures centrally: It turns out that this doing one's own work-provided that it comes to be in a certain way-is justice. (433b) Justice is not attempting to outdo everyone, it is not attempting to get as much as one can for himself; it is doing what is appropriate for oneself. Outdoing, I take it, consists not just in trying to best one's colleagues and others, but also in trying to get as much as one can for himself, whether it be (for example) money or honor. This, at least, is what is suggested by what Glaucon says: The reason for this [the just and the unjust behaving in the same way] is the desire to outdo others and get more and more. (359c)

Doing one's own work is doing what is appropriate for oneself. The musician tunes his lyre; the doctor prescribes a certain course of treatment for his patients. Neither the musician nor the doctor tries to outdo his colleagues; that would not be appropriate. They would, in a sense, not be doing their own work if they were to try to outdo their colleagues. The musician, in his quest to make his lyre more perfectly in tune, will probably make it out of tune instead, because he is so focused on besting the other musicians that he cannot concentrate fully on the task of tuning (perhaps). In the same way, the doctor may not heal his patient, because he will be so caught up in trying to outdo the other doctors that he will not treat the patient as best he can. It seems reasonable that the wrong sort of outdoing (trying to outdo everyone, i.e. pleonexia) is harmful, because it gets in the way of performing the task at hand. The right sort of outdoing (trying to outdo only those unlike yourself) is natural and not harmful. Of course the musician will tune his lyre better than the non-musician; it comes with doing one's own work.

Pleonexia is the root of the problem of the city with a fever. (373a) Unnecessary desires lead the citizens to want more and more, to indulge in more luxuries, to procure more land for the city. These desires lead to unrest within the city and war with its neighbors. Socrates contrasts this city with the healthy city of bare necessity. If the unnecessary desires are left unchecked, the city will quickly fall into injustice, so philosophers are needed to keep the desires at bay, to keep them from destroying the city. This is analogous to the way reason checks the appetitive desires of the soul, so they do not destroy the soul.

We have seen that Socrates' argument that the just are clever and good and the unjust are ignorant and bad falls short, because its assumptions about the clever being good, the ignorant being bad, and people having the qualities of those they resemble do not appear to hold true. Further justification needs to be given in order to satisfactorily show that the just are indeed clever and good and the unjust ignorant and bad. The idea of pleonexia is later used to explain the unjust, feverish city, and its analogous state of the soul. Socrates' argument against Thrasymachus also figures into the way he defines Justice later on in the Republic. Each doing his own work is similar to the way the musician and the doctor do their work, without trying to overreach or trying to outdo anyone.",0,0,0,6.5,8180
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Gilbert and Directions of Correspondence,"In this short paper, I will discuss J. David Velleman's paper The Self As Narrator. More specifically, I will question his claim that if a robot can maintain correspondence, he can maintain it in both directions.

To quote Velleman: A robot that can maintain correspondence in one direction, by saying that he's locked in the closet when he is, should be able to maintain correspondence the other direction, by going into the closet when he has said that he will. (10) I take this to mean that being able to maintain correspondence in the past direction (being able to say he's locked in the closet when he is) is sufficient for being able to maintain correspondence in the other direction (being able to go in the closet when he has said he will). However, I don't see why this is necessarily the case. Certainly we can imagine a robot who is only able to narrate what is currently happening to him, or what has just happened to him (including relevant causes and effects), but is unable to make predictions about what he is going to do next, to narrate ahead of himself. (10) So, he can say things like I'm locked in the closet but not things like I'm about to get up and go to the closet.

What makes him unable to narrate ahead of himself? Maybe he doesn't know what he is about to do until he actually does it. This could happen for a number of reasons. Perhaps Gilbert finds himself propelled along, unable to control his actions (maybe a human with a remote controls him), and so unable to predict what he will do next. Or, perhaps what controls Gilbert's actions is internal to him, but he is still unable to narrate ahead of himself, because he lacks epistemic access to his control center's decisions. There could be a simpler explanation: maybe Gilbert's program doesn't include a narrating ahead function (or a number of functions which together enable him to narrate ahead).

Alternatively, we can suppose that Gilbert can narrate past and current events, and that he is able to make predictions about himself. However, he is not able to fulfill those predictions. So, Gilbert can say things like I'm going to go to the closet now, but he doesn't go to the closet; he never performs the actions which correspond to his predictions. This hardly sounds like Gilbert is able to narrate ahead of himself, since he never performs the actions he says he will perform. Again, we can ask why Gilbert is unable to fulfill his predictions about himself, and some of the above reasons apply. Perhaps he is externally controlled.

Whatever the reason, it is at least conceivable that Gilbert can make predictions about himself but never fulfill these predictions. Likewise, it is possible that Gilbert is able only to narrate current and past events, not future ones. There is no reason I see that a robot that can maintain correspondence in the past direction should be able to maintain correspondence in the other direction.

Now, it might be that the reasons I've suggested for Gilbert's inability to either make or fulfill predictions are problematic (they prohibit us from saying all that we could or would want to say of Gilbert). However, it seems plausible that his inabilities could be explained in many ways, not all of which are problematic. Or, perhaps it enough for us to be able to imagine Gilbert's inabilities, without requiring an explanation of them.",72.93,74.82,34.98,34.98,3369
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic,"In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant attempts to prove that our representation of space is a priori. In the A edition, Kant defines a priori cognitions as universal cognitions, which at the same time have the character of inner necessity (A2), and in the B edition he makes clear that such cognitions must be independent of all experience and even of all the impressions of the senses (B2)1. Kant offers two arguments for the apriority of space. The first argument, located at A23/B38, proceeds as follows. First, Kant notes that we represent things as located both outside of our selves and of one another. He then asserts that it is only possible to represent things as outside of ourselves and of one another because we already have a representation of space in which to place these things (in order to represent them as outside one another, thus not merely different but as in different places, the representation of space must already be their ground). Thus outer experience is only possible through our representation of space. Kant concludes by stating that space is therefore not an empirical concept derived from experience. To state this in terms of a priority, it is necessary also to assume that a concept is either derived from experience or a priori, and that therefore the representation of space must be a priori.

The classic objection to this argument is that it proves too much-that, for example, we would need to presuppose red in order to represent things as red. Henry Allison attempts to solve this problem by asserting that Kant's argument is not that the representation of space must be presupposed in order to understand objects as spatial, but instead that the representation of space is necessary in order to be aware of things as distinct from ourselves and from each other (86). He supports this assertion by contrasting Kant's outer sense with inner sense: whereas inner sense is the awareness of the self and its states, outer sense is the awareness of objects distinct from the self and its states (83). He also says that when Kant speaks of objects as outside of each other, that should be taken to imply a contrast between awareness of numerical distinction and qualitative distinction-knowing that objects are outside of each other means that we know that they are numerically distinct (83).

Allison's argument, however, is unsatisfactory. Allison claims that Kant's argument actually rests on the fact that outside is not a spatial term, but instead means distinct from. While it may be true that knowing that things are outside of each other means knowing that they are distinct from each other, Kant is at great pains to make it clear that he is speaking of outside spatially2. After saying that sensations are related to something outside me, Kant adds in a parenthesis i.e., to something in another place in space from that which I find myself (A23/B38). In this parenthesis, Kant makes explicit that he is talking exclusively about spatial relations, an impression that is strengthened by his statement that regarding objects as outside one another means regarding them as not merely as different but as in different places (A23/B38). The emphasis here is on the different places that the objects are in, not on the differences between the objects themselves. Allison's argument that Kant's primary focus is not on space is thus unpersuasive. The objection to Kant's first argument, that it proves too much, has not been satisfactorily answered.

The second argument that our representation of space is a priori immediately follows the first, and is found on A24/B38-9. First, Kant states that it is impossible for us to represent the non-existence of space. Then he adds that it is possible for us to represent empty space, that is, space with no objects in it. From these premises, Kant concludes first that space is a condition of the possibility of appearances, and second that space is not dependent on appearances. Since the representation of space is a necessary condition of appearances/experience and is not dependent on them, it is a priori.

This argument is somewhat more successful than the first. However, there is a problem with the premises. As Charles Parsons has noted in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, it is unclear exactly why it is impossible for us to represent the non-existence of space. We can conceive of a non-spatial world as logically possible-Kant's own world of noumena is essentially non-spatial. Kant seems to be referring to a psychological inability to think or visualize a non-spatial world, but the vagaries of our own psychology are not necessarily a guide to actual possibility. A similar problem obtains in the second premise. It is not certain that when we imagine space without objects, we do not actually imagine space with a few infinitesimally small particles, or as Parsons has it, with objects of which we have no knowledge (69). However, this second objection is not as serious as it may appear. If it is a problem for Kant to state that it is impossible to represent the non-existence of space, it is equally problematic to assume that it is impossible to imagine space without objects. The objections raised for Kant's first premise hold equally for the objections to his second premise-space without objects seems logically possible, if difficult to conceive of psychologically. We must choose which premise to be discontented with. It seems clear, then, that at least one of the conclusions must hold. If we quarrel with the first premise, that we can imagine a world without space, we can still conclude that space doesn't depend on appearances, since we can imagine a space without any objects to appear in it. If we quarrel with the second premise, we can still conclude that a representation of space must exist even before experience, since we cannot avoid having a representation of space even without experience.

In addition to arguing that the representation of space is a priori, Kant also argues that our representation of space is an intuition rather than a concept. Kant's definitions of intuitions and concepts are spread throughout the Critique, but two passages seem especially relevant. The first, located in the Transcendental Logic, describes our two sources of cognition: the reception of representations (the receptivity of impressions), [and] the faculty for cognizing an object by means of these representations (spontaneity of concepts) (A50/B74). The first faculty is related to intuitions, the second to concepts. Intuitions, then, are representations in which an object is given to us, while in concepts objects are thought in relation to that representation (A50/B74). Intuitions are directly received, while concepts are ways of thinking about the objects of intuitions. The second important passage occurs on A320/B377. Speaking of intuitions and concepts, Kant writes that the former is immediately related to the object and is singular; the latter is mediate, by means of a mark, which can be common to several things. While both concepts and intuitions are representations, intuitions are representations of individual objects and are direct perceptions, while concepts are representations of universals (which can be common to several things), and are indirect, or mediate.

Kant has two arguments that the representation of space is an intuition; this paper will examine only the first.3 Kant first asserts that we can think of only one space, that one can only represent a single space (A25/B39)4. He then remarks that we may think of many spaces, but they are understood as only parts of the one space. These spaces then cannot be prior to space-that is, they cannot precede the single all-encompassing space as its components. Space is not made up of spaces. Space is then essentially single-it is unique in that we can only think of one space, and it is all-encompassing, a complete totality. Kant concludes that our representation of space is a pure intuition.

This argument successfully demonstrates that space is particular, one of the two defining characteristics of an intuition. Space may be able to be carved up into many different spaces, but space itself is not made up of these spaces. Space is, essentially, one thing. For Kant, the space may appear to be manifold because we place limitations on it, marking contingent boundaries around an area that we necessarily think of as part of an essentially unified whole: It [space] is essentially single, the manifold in it, thus also the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on limitations. Kant's point here is that we must have the singular space before we can have spaces, since spaces can only arise as a result of limiting space. The reverse operation, whereby many spaces are aggregated to form space, does not occur. And in fact, when we think of aggregating spaces, we think of removing barriers-walls, for instance-rather than bringing spaces together. This demonstrates that spaces are derived from space, and not the reverse. Space cannot, then be a concept, as it is not thought in relation to the representation of spaces-our idea of space is not dependent on spaces. Space thus must be an intuition as Kant defines the terms.",0,0,28.65,24.79,9248
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,Music and Negative Emotion,"In his essay, Music and Negative Emotion, Jerrold Levinson attempts to explain a strange phenomenon: people finding pleasure in music that conveys emotions with normally distressing connotations. By explaining the differences between musically aroused emotion and those we usually experience, refuting misleading explanations, and formulating some more reasonable ones of his own, Levinson makes a noble attempt to delve into this curious, yet common occurrence. His investigations yield eight distinct rewards conferred upon a listener of such musical works. While Levinson's essay presents a fairly comprehensive argument, it contains several flaws, leading him to too hastily reject valid arguments, or fail to encompass other useful explanations. Although by no means presenting its own unified explanation of the rewards of listening to negatively emotional music, this essay will endeavor to supplement Levinson's line of reasoning.

One of the main faults of Levinson's argument is a premature inclination to dismiss alternate explanations of why we seek out negative emotions. Just as Clive Bell's aesthetic emotion cannot account for all of the ways in which art affects us, there is no one reason that we feel happy when hearing sad (angry, etc.) music. (Indeed, Levinson thinks of eight!) Levinson's rejection of the many justifications of this occurrence often relies on their failure to be applied to every specific case of a general and varied phenomenon. But there is no reason that, taken together, these theories might explain a large quantity of the scenarios in which sad music gives us cheer. Therefore, it will be fruitful to revisit some of the philosophies Levinson refutes.

Hindemith posited the idea that music appeals to previously-experienced emotions in the listener, or evokes memories of events that inspired those emotions. While Cooke makes the point that this is not possible in all cases, if it is useful in describing some situations, it is worth consideration. But Hindemith faces a secondary objection. Why, Levinson argues, would we want to bring up memories of sad times or feelings? The answer to this question can actually be found within Levinson's own discourse. Firstly, a memory would be a sort of removal from the life-implications that real emotions carry with them. There is no further action to be taken, no immediate stimulus to respond to; whatever course of events that was to unfold has already happened, and a new state of emotion has replaced whatever feelings the individual experienced before. Thus, the three rewards associated with concentrating on a pure emotion, divorced from an immediate context, are fulfilled in the case of a memory. We may savor the feeling of the emotion for its own sake, may explore the nature of our emotions in order to gain a further understanding, and remind ourselves that we are capable of feeling such emotions. Similarly, as emotions raised by memories do come to an end, by associating those memories with the music, we can re-live our eventual mastery over the sadness in our lives. And, as this success corresponds with real events, the psychological return is probably that much sweeter. This constitutes what Levinson calls the reward of Emotional Resolution.

Levinson also attacks the idea that one may listen to a piece of music and not adopt the feelings which it expresses. This way of approaching music, in his opinion, is not as fulfilling as actually partaking in the emotions it presents to the listener. However, it is still a possibility, and therefore may explain some cases where one encounters the allure of music expressing negative emotions. Perhaps Levinson believes that not feeling sad when listening to sad music robs one of the empathetic response that music so often evokes. But even in the case where the listener does not participate in the emotion expressed, one may still imagine a fictional entity who feels sadness, or imagine the composer to be in the same mental state. Therefore, the reward of Emotional Communion can still be gained from identifying with this fictional persona whose sorrow the music expresses; it is simply a matter of feeling sympathy in place of empathy. Just because we do not feel the emotions put forth in the music in one instance does not mean that we are incapable of remembering when we have felt them, or feel ourselves incapable of ever embodying them in the future. Pity for a person in distress is just as much of a connective force between human beings as feeling yourself in the same state, without the more distressing side effects.

Not feeling the emotions expressed in the music, only pitying the person one imagines to possess them, may actually benefit the listener more than an empathetic response. If feeling emotions with no life implications- in effect, distancing oneself from the emotion- can help us learn what a feeling is like, totally divorcing one's self from the emotion can give us even more of an objective view. As Levinson says, this would give the listener an opportunity to introspectively scrutinize and ponder the affective dimension of an emotion- say anguish- whose idea is before the mind, in a manner not open to the individual in the throes of real anguish (325). Therefore, gleaning no emotion from a piece of music, only perceiving it, can augment the reward of Understanding Feeling.

On a side note, the practice of distancing one's self from the emotions expressed in a piece of music not only leaves the listener more capable of understanding those feelings, but of appreciating the music as a work of art. One may be impressed by the ability of a painting to represent its subject, such as a sad face, without actually feeling sad. And, if one was to be saddened by this picture, the observer might not pay as much attention to the painting itself, as much as they would their own emotion. Similarly, if one was to feel the emotions expressed in music, they would dwell more upon that feeling than upon the music itself. Taking a step back allows us to ask about the representation. For example: What about the painting makes the person look so sad? Isn't it remarkable how life-like that frown is? What in the music reminds us so much of sadness? That last phrase was particularly beautiful; the composer has done a marvelous job. Divorcing personal experience of feelings from the expressed content of the music therefore enables the listener to enjoy music with negative emotions for both a greater understanding of those emotions, and for the artistry of the piece itself.

Now that further value has been gleaned from ideas originally rejected by Levinson, it is time to turn to the arguments that Levinson makes himself, or has overlooked completely. Levinson lays out three initial conditions necessary for considering music in an aesthetic matter. The second of these states the following: …a mode of attention closely focused on the music, its structure, progression and emergent character, with a consequent inattention to, or reduced consciousness of, the extramusical world and one's present situation (320). While it is obvious that the music must be the main focus of contemplation, it is less apparent why the listener's personal circumstances must be left out of the picture. If the question being examined (namely, why do people actively seek out the experience of music containing negative emotions) involves the motivations of the listener, it would seem that their state of mind would be important in determining the answer.

Indeed, when I asked myself why I most frequently listened to sad (or other emotionally negatively charged) music, I found that most times, the answer had to do with my own present emotional state: I most often listen to sad music when I, myself, am feeling sad. I identify with the emotional content of the music; it expresses what I am feeling. The explanation for this phenomenon might be found by reconfiguring an idea of Levinson's. If we can empathize with a person whom we feel is expressing their sorrow through the music, why can't the music, via the persona we give it (that of the composer, or a fictional character feeling the same way as the listener) reciprocate when we are feeling poorly? It would seem that being comforted by the music would more powerfully assure us that we are manifestly not alone in the emotional universe (329), than simply empathizing with an unknown person who is sad for an undefined reason. Therefore, by allowing one's personal circumstances to be given a musical voice, the reward of Emotional Communion is increased dramatically.

There are other benefits to letting one's emotions color their perception of music which conveys similar expressions. These, too, are manifestations of Levinson's ideas, specifically the rewards of Expressive Potency and Emotional Resolution. The former is no different than if one was simply imagining oneself possessed of real negative emotion (328); by giving our emotions an aesthetic beauty, we are able to withstand the suffering they give us. The latter reward, Emotional Resolution, is given new significance if personal emotional states are involved. Not only does the music (if one is intent on the music, and not simply in stewing in whatever state one is experiencing) give clarifying direction and form to negative emotions, but at the end of the piece, these emotions will be fully worked through. This allows the listener to more effectively (i.e. calmly, rationally) deal with the reasons/conditions that initially triggered the emotions in the first place, rather than dwelling on the emotions themselves. Music expressing negative emotions, in this way, becomes a therapeutic tool in the process of problem solving.

Another explanation for why Levinson is so quick to exclude the listener's personal emotional state might be found in his denial that the music itself can inspire full-fledged emotions. If this were so, we could never fully identify our emotional state with that expressed in the piece we were listening to, as there would be no analog for the cognitive element of our emotions. Levinson argues, When a symphonic adagio saddens me, I am not sad at or about the music, nor do I regard the adagio as something I would wish to be otherwise (314). When we are saddened by sad music…we generally are not making believe that there is a particular object, with particular characteristics, for us to be sad about…Nor do we make believe that we have certain attitudes or desires toward such determinate intentional objects (317). This would seem to suggest that because we have certain beliefs or desires about the cognitive element (the object) of our emotion, we cannot fully identify them with the music. The benefits of listening to sad music could not be gained; instead, we would be consumed by the problem at hand.

But why can't we have attitudes or desires about music? I can hope that a piece I don't like will end after the next musical phrase. I can expect that a series of notes will resolve on a particular chord. It is possible for me to believe or wish for a change in any facet of the music. I don't even need to be able to imagine an alternative; wishing the music to be another way than what it currently is would be enough. Our experience with music will tell us that the piece is already written, and these desires will most likely not come true (maybe later in the piece the composer does transform a phrase into something that we like better.) Just because you have attitudes or desires about something does not mean you expect them to come true. And just because they are unlikely to do so does not preclude you from having them. Therefore, we are able to be sad about a musical outcome.

Additionally, I would argue that one could imagine a particular object about which the music (or the creator of the music) is sad. For example, we are perfectly capable of asserting that a certain musical piece expresses grief. Where did that emotion come from? Levinson grants the listener the use of the Expressionist assumption; let us put it to work. The grief we hear in a piece is someone's expression of their emotion; namely, the composer. The grief of the composer is not groundless; there must be a reason for it, or an object of it. He has lost a concrete something and has attitudes and desires about this entity. One could easily imagine this object to be a person close to the composer, say, his wife. She has died, and because he loved her (attitude), and wants her never to have died (desire), he is grieved. There is no reason to believe that an [e]motional response to music does not have the same degree of cognitive structure as emotional response to well-delineated entities of fictional worlds (317). The music may indeed have a subject who is well-defined, and fictional, as we have shown. And if, at the death of my puppy, I listen to this piece of music, there is no reason I should be unable to associate my loss of my faithful companion with the composer's loss of his wife. That is, I will be able to fully identify with the musical emotion and its cognitive element while my real-life emotions are present in my mind.

When discussing the reward of Emotional Resolution, Levinson finds it useful to draw comparisons between the nature of music and the nature of negative emotions, stating that both are finite. But there are other interesting similarities between the act of listening to music, and that of experiencing negative emotions. One idea, which Levinson does not consider, is that one who has the inclination of listening to music might be actually predisposed to gaining pleasure from negative emotions. Actively listening to music entails shutting out other sounds and isolating our attention to the piece at hand. This is especially the case when one wishes to focus on the emotional implications and representations of a piece; one could hear a piece while having a conversation with another person, but chances are, the hearer would not grasp the ideas conveyed by it. Thus, listening to music in the way that Levinson suggests is a private experience, which entails separating ourselves from other human interactions. Indeed, in the example given by the author, a man sequesters himself in his easy chair as he experiences his musical negative emotions.

Similarly, most negative emotions carry the connotation of isolation, or loss of contact. For example, grief is a manifestation of missing something or someone now gone, rage may result in the urge to destroy another with whom one is angry, and the pain of unrequited love is due to the failure to create a bond between two people. These instances certainly do not seem to be the pleasantest of sensations. However, those who appreciate the solitude they gain by listening to music may, in fact, find the same sort of pleasure in experiencing emotional states of seclusion, finding it allows them to focus on tasks at hand. In the case of listening to music, the task is to understand what the music means to express. In the case of experiencing negative emotions, the task is to focus on what those emotions mean to us and feel like. Although his line of reasoning differs, Levinson notes a similar sensation in the rewards of Apprehending Expression and Understanding Feeling. By isolating oneself, either by physically tuning out the world, or by feeling oneself alone in a negative emotion, the listener can gain an increased focus. This leads to a better perception of the musical or emotional content of the work.

When considering music and negative emotions, Levinson certainly hits upon an intriguing puzzle. Just thinking about my personal musical collection, I can recall as many sad pieces as I can happy ones. Indeed, some of my favorite songs are sad, yet I enjoy them greatly. And just as Levinson says, I do gain the rewards of Apprehending Expression, Emotional Catharsis, Savoring Feeling, Understanding Feeling, Emotional Assurance, Emotional Resolution, Expressive Potency, and Emotional Communion. But I also gain pleasure from parts of the music that Levinson believes should not affect my interpretation, or has not taken into consideration. I relate the negative emotions in music to memories of times when I have experienced them in real-life contexts, gaining satisfaction in the remembrance of how I triumphed over them through the resolution of the piece. Sometimes, I do not feel the emotions the music expresses, but only pity the person I imagine to possess them. I admire the music for its ability to so powerfully represent negative emotions, and examine those emotions without adopting them. Many times, I relate a current experience of negative emotions to those I perceive in a musical piece, and the music comforts me and helps me work through a troubling time. And finally, listening to sad, angry, or grief-laden music allows me a peaceful time of private reflection and intellectual probing into the nature of my emotions and musical nature. In addition to giving me new pleasant effects, these practices often further enhance the eight rewards Levinson discusses. For all of these reasons, listening to music expressing negative emotions continues to be a frequent, productive, and enjoyable practice.",0,0,0,9.87,17307
Philosophy,Critique/Evaluation,Undergraduate,"The Chinese Room, and What It Takes to Build a Mind","In the past several decades, computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers have made great progress in developing computer programs with the ability to mimic processes of human cognition. With increasing speed, complexity, and processing power, these programs show a striking resemblance to the human mind. Some even claim these technologies further emphasize the analogies between the functioning of the human brain and the functioning of digital computers and promote a functionalist conception of the mind1. Within philosophy of mind, functionalism is a doctrine generally stating that what makes something a mental state does not rely on its physical composition, but solely on its function, or the role it plays within a larger cognitive system. All forms of functionalism, in one way or another, claim that mental states are those states which are causally related to so-called inputs, outputs and internal roles - or in other words, sensory stimulations, behavior and other mental states. In his 1980 essay, Minds, Brains and Programs, philosopher John Searle questions the functionalist conception of the mind by asking, what psychological and philosophical significance should we attach to recent efforts at computer simulations of human cognitive capacities? 2. Generally speaking, functionalist theories of the mind hold that if two things such as human brains and digital computers are functionally similar, they are also psychologically similar. Searle rejects this claim by arguing appropriately programmed computers with the right inputs and outputs are not minds, and cannot be said to understand and have mental states in the same way humans can. Using what is called the Chinese Room counterexample, Searle attempts to show the absurdity of functionalism by giving an example of a system that is functionally similar to the human mind, but different he believes psychologically. Searle hopes to describe a scenario in which all plausible versions of functionalism agree that understanding of Chinese - and hence mental states exist, but our intuitions prevent us from believing so3. Searle's counterexample has been extensively critiqued since it was described in 1980, and many replies to the Chinese Room are included in Minds, Brains and Programs. I believe two of these replies, the Systems Reply and the Robot Reply, provide the best forum for exploring the strengths and weaknesses of Searle's argument against functionalism. Through my analysis of the Systems Reply, I intend to show that no digital computer could ever understand any human language because doing so would require semantic ability beyond the capacity of the computer. I will also use the Systems Reply as a means to clarify which functional roles are important for understanding, and therefore important for having mental states in general. I believe that Searle's argument ultimately fails to invalidate functionalism because it does not describe a functional duplicate to the human mind. Using an embellished version of the Robot Reply, I will show that the Chinese Room as described by Searle does not have the kind of causally interactive internal roles we associate with minds, and therefore poses no threat to functionalism.

Searle begins Minds, Brains and Programs by describing a program, developed by Roger Schank, with the ability to simulate the human capacity to understand stories. A characteristic of this capacity lies in our ability to answer questions about information not explicitly stated in the stories. Schank's machines can similarly answer questions in this fashion […] to do this they have a representation of the sort of in formation that human beings have, which enables them to answer such questions given the stories 4. Using Schank's program as a model, Searle's Chinese Room counterexample to functionalism goes as follows. Searle asks us to imagine an English-speaking man, who I will call Hal, sitting alone in a room. Hal has absolutely no understanding of Chinese, and would be unable for that matter to distinguish Chinese characters from meaningless scribbles. Two slots, one where papers are fed into the room and one where papers can be sent out, are his only contact with the outside world. Hal is fed stories and questions in Chinese through the input slot. With an instruction manual written in English, he manipulates the meaningless characters he sees, makes various calculations, and ultimately writes down more meaningless characters. Once he is done writing, he feeds his work through the output slot. When read by a native-Chinese speaker, Hal's writings appear to be intelligent answers to questions about the stories written by someone who understands Chinese. The crux of Searle's argument is that to a bystander reading his work, Hal appears to understand Chinese, but we know well that Hal has no understanding of Chinese at all. If functionalism is true, and indeed the Chinese Room is functionally similar to our minds in the relevant ways, then Hal must understand Chinese. Therefore, since Hal clearly does not understand Chinese, functionalism must be false. Troubled by this conclusion, many philosophers have responded to Searle's argument in attempts to explain how understanding is in fact generated in the Chinese Room counterexample.

Two of the replies included in Minds, Brains and Programs, the Systems Reply and the Robot Reply, defend functionalism by showing us either that understanding does exist in the Chinese Room or what would be required for such to be the case. Though neither succeeds in completely undermining Searle's conclusions, I believe they indicate both what would be required for understanding and why Searle's argument against functionalism ultimately fails. The Systems Reply asserts while it is true that the individual person who is locked in the room does not understand the story, the fact is that he is merely part of a whole system, and the system does understand 5. In other words, Hal does not understand Chinese, but the entire system - encompassing Hal, the instruction manual, and any other materials used by Hal to produce his final responses - does understand Chinese. First of all, I find the idea absurd (as does Searle) that if Hal clearly does not understand Chinese, somehow the conjunction of Hal, the instruction manual, and any other materials in the room might understand Chinese6. Searle however, entertains the objection and responds by suggesting that Hal memorize the instruction manual and do all of the character manipulations in his head. Searle believes even in this new case, Hal encompasses the entire system and still does not understand Chinese. Many philosophers have argued that in this new version of the Chinese Room where Hal has internalized all elements of the system, the system (which does understand Chinese) would continue to exist - just as a component of Hal's mind. Analogies of the scenario have been given - either of two personalities inhabiting the same brain or of one computer emulating the behavior of a different machine. I do not find this strand of argument against Searle's response to be compelling. This is because these analogies are set up under fundamentally different circumstances; namely, not involving the creation of a new entity through memorizing a book. It goes against our intuitions that Hal's memorizing the instruction manual should create an extra entity with the capability to understand Chinese. If the instruction manual and other elements in the Chinese Room do not constitute a mind with the ability to understand Chinese in the original case, it does not seem that they should then constitute a mind when internalized by Hal. Therefore, I believe that because the system lacks some fundamental property necessary for understanding, the Systems Reply cannot explain away the conclusions of Searle's argument.

Although the Systems Reply does not refute Searle's argument against functionalism, it does help clarify what is required both for understanding and having mental states. Understanding a language such as Chinese requires more than the ability to manipulate characters, even if those manipulations are able to produce intelligible answers to questions in Chinese. It seems, as illustrated by the Systems Reply, that Hal (or the entire system) will only understand Chinese when the characters are no longer recognized as mere scribbles; they must be formed into words that carry meaning. Imagine what would happen if Hal were to read a sentence in English. He would immediately see beyond the shape of the letters composing the words, he would comprehend their meaning. In this sense, Hal understands English because he has a mastery of English semantics. It is clear Hal does not have the same semantic mastery of Chinese. He is only able to recognize the structure of Chinese characters and follow instructions for manipulating these characters. Thus, it could be said Hal has some syntactic ability, but clearly not semantic ability. Searle's Chinese Room counterexample succeeds in showing that understanding a language, or indeed, having mental states at all, involves more than just having a bunch of formal symbols. It involves having an interpretation, or a meaning attached to those symbols 7. In response to the Systems reply, it is clear that regardless of whether the system is external or internal to Hal, the fact still remains that predefined and purely abstract steps are used to generate his responses to the stories in Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese Room counterexample shows us that no computer program (by today's standards of programming) could ever understand language, because these systems are purely syntactical. They are based on a formal structure of rules, and lack the sort of semantic content contained within human minds. Even in light of the Systems Reply, it appears that the system contained in the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese. However, in order to show the absurdity of functionalism, Searle's argument must also establish that the Chinese Room counterexample describes an entity that is functionally identical to our minds. Thus, as we have seen, it must describe a program with mastery of semantics.

Our understanding of English semantics developed for each of us early in our childhood as we gained experience with the world. If mastery of semantics is necessary for understanding language, a system must be able to interact with the environment in order to acquire semantics through learning. The Robot Reply can be seen as an attempt to create a scenario where through interaction with the environment, a syntactical system such as Hal in the Chinese Room can gain mastery of semantics In this sense, the Robot Reply and its embellished forms transform the Chinese Room into an entity that is a true candidate for understanding and having mental states. Take for example, a fully embellished form of the Robot Reply presented by Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson in Philosophy of Mind and Cognition. Imagine a robot that transmits information about inputs from its visual, auditory, and other sensory components directly to Hal in the form of Chinese characters. Hal takes the characters from these inputs, and now working much quicker and using an even larger instruction manual, he performs the appropriate manipulations and calculations. Once Hal is finished, he transmits his response back to the robot, which cause the robot to interact with its environment in the same way we do. Imagine also that the instruction manual Hal uses is fashioned such that it takes into account all input and output characters, and how often they have occurred. This enormously complex instruction manual would include instructions on how Hal should alter it in response to previously received input, ensuring that novel responses are generated in each case8. With the increased complexity of this highly embellished case, we may begin to intuit that this robot is capable of understanding. After all, in addition to having functionally similar inputs and outputs, the robot's ability to produce novel behaviors in response to experience seems functionally similar to our capacity for memory. Indeed, this kind of memory would also seem to allow the robot to gain semantic mastery. Notice that this embellished example is so far removed from Searle's original Chinese Room scenario that it poses no threat to his argument. Without the embellishment, the Robot Reply would be no better off than the Systems Reply because as we have seen, the purely syntactic organization of the Chinese Room is incapable of generating understanding. However, with even more embellishment, the Robot Reply can describe an entity that all plausible forms of functionalism would agree understood and had mental states. Contrasting the entity in Searle's original counterexample to this embellished Chinese Room-Robot, we can see why Searle's argument against functionalism is unsuccessful.

Searle's Chinese Room counterexample to functionalism fails to describe an entity with functionally identical inputs, outputs and internal roles associated with our minds. Indeed, certain forms of the Robot Reply create unembellished examples of the Chinese Room with functionally identical inputs and outputs, including the ability to have sensory experiences and interact with the environment. However, these forms are unable to produce the sorts of functionally identical internal roles important for understanding of language and having mental states. The Systems and Robot Replies to Searle's argument have shown that in order for an entity to understand a language, it must master the language's semantics. This can only be accomplished through learning and memory, by which words become associated with meanings. The entity in Searle's original counterexample lacks the internal roles necessary for learning and memory. For instance, it is incapable of accounting for all previous inputs and outputs, and generating novel responses in each case. All plausible forms of functionalism and our intuitions agree that Searle's original Chinese Room is not a candidate for understanding and having mental states. Our intuition is that only the highly embellished forms of the counterexample (those much different from Searle's original counterexample) have these capacities, and are able to understand Chinese and have mental states. Only these highly embellished Chinese Room-Robots can begin to have the sort of functionally identical internal roles (such as those involved in learning, memory, and other processes) required by functionalist theories to be psychologically similar to us. Therefore, it is impossible for Searle's Chinese Room counterexample to prevent our intuitions from agreeing with functionalism.",34.78,18.34,5.16,1.75,14813
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Two Distinctions in Kant,"In his Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant makes two distinctions: first, between analytic and synthetic judgments; second, between a priori and a posteriori judgments.1 These distinctions play an essential role in his justification of metaphysics as a natural science and in his argument that metaphysical reasoning, rather than empirical experimentation, is responsible for our understanding of much of the world. My purpose here is to (1) explain these distinctions and Kant's arguments for them, (2) examine the conclusions which follow from them, and (3) examine why Kant believes Euclid's geometric theorems are a priori synthetic.

I. Explaining Kant's Distinctions
Affirmative analytic judgments are, for Kant, claims in which the truth of the predicate belongs to the subject by identity (i.e. by definition).2 They are not judgments about concepts, but rather judgments about the truth of concept-relationships. His example, all bodies are extended, illustrates his point. If we expand the body concept, the same judgment looks like this: All physical objects having extension and a certain level of solidity are extended. The truth of the predicate concept of extension is inseparably a part of the definition of a body, and the analytic judgment just elucidates this. Since analytic predicates merely break down the subject into constituent parts, we may also call these judgments explicative.

However, notice that here Kant explains only affirmative judgments; he is so far silent about negative, disjunctive, if-then, wide scope, and other types of judgments. Later in the Critique he offers a second definition of analyticity regarding judgments: if a judgment is analytic, whether negative or affirmative, its truth can always be known in accordance with the Principle of Contradiction.3 This more inclusive definition covers all possible analytic judgments in Kant's Critique, and thus is satisfactory.

Synthetic judgments, then, are those in which the truth of the predicate is connected to the subject, but is not inherent in the subject by definition.4 For example, the judgment that all Euclidian triangles contain two right angles gives us a synthetic truth: containment of two right angles is in no way inherent in the definition of triangles, but it is always necessarily connected to the subject. From Kant's example, all bodies are heavy, we can see that the truth of are heavy is inextricably connected to bodies, but not inherent in the concept of bodies (in the way extension is). Whereas analytic judgments are of the form: All A & B & C's are C's, synthetic judgments are of the form: all A & B & C's are D's. Because the predicate adds a new truth to the subject, we may call these expansive judgments.5

I should note for the sake of clarity that this distinction, between analytic and synthetic, applies not to concepts but to judgments and, more particularly, their truths. From the judgment, all bachelors are unmarried, we obtain an analytic truth: the concept of unmarried is inherent in the concept of bachelors. Likewise, synthetic truths are obtained from their respective judgments (e.g. all bodies have weight). Note also that Kant's discussion of a priori and a posteriori applies to judgments, concepts, and knowledge.

There is nothing philosophically interesting about the way Kant uses the term a posteriori. He means knowable only through empirical experience-the definition commonly accepted in philosophy. What is interesting, however, is his use of the term a priori. In order to understand this, it is necessary first to understand some of Kant's metaphysics.

Kant believes that we cannot know objects as things, having their own properties, entirely independent of our cognition. That is, we can't know them in abstraction from everything, including time and space. Rather, he thinks that things in the world conform to our cognition of them. We can know things in the world only insofar as we perceive them; we cannot know them apart from our perception. Kant later explains this idea in terms of his Categories. But this metaphysics does not allow for a priori knowledge of the world, in the traditional sense. If we can't understand things as they are themselves-that is, independent of ourselves-then we can't have any knowledge that comes prior to our experience. Thus, a modified definition of a priori is necessary.

By a priori [regarding judgments], Kant means, knowable with just enough experience to understand the concepts involved in it. 6 Another way of saying this is that a priori judgments are mind-supplied-they require no sense experience beyond the absolute minimum. This is as close to the traditional definition as he can get in his system of metaphysics. A priori judgments are distinct from a posteriori ones in that they require not full empirical experience of the concepts, but rather the fact of having had experience of the world.

For experience itself is a way of cognizing for which I need the understanding. But the understanding has its rule, a rule that I must presuppose within me even before objects are given to me, and hence must presuppose a priori; and that rule is expressed in a priori concepts. Hence all objects of experience must necessarily conform to these concepts and agree with them. 7

He also gives two criteria for a prioricity: (1) a judgment must be thought along with its necessity, and (2) the judgment must have strict universality (as opposed to empirical universality).8

We may then take Kant's a priori not as a way of knowing things, but rather as a way of justifying judgments. A posteriori judgments are justified by sense experience; a priori judgments are justified either by containment (analytic) or by connection (synthetic) of concepts. A priori truths are obtainable on the condition of possessing absolute minimum sense experience; a posteriori truths are obtainable on the condition of possessing a relatively great deal of sense experience. Put differently, all we need to obtain a priori truths is having had any experience at all, whereas we need more extensive examination of things to obtain a posteriori truths about them.

Kant's a priori is a rule for the function of the understanding. He names pure mathematics and (relatively) pure physics as paradigmatic examples of fields that are understood a priori, and it is easy to see how we can reason a priori from their premises to their conclusions.9

One problem with Kant's modified a prioricity, however, is circularity. Kant uses his transcendental idealist metaphysics to justify a modified a prioricity (p.638, Bxvi-xviii), but then uses his new definition to justify his metaphysics (p.643, B16-17). While this may or may not cause further complications, it is only one of many validity problems in the Critique.

II. Consequences of the Distinctions
These two distinctions function centrally on various levels in the Critique, but I will consider only the ideas immediately following from them. On the smallest level, these distinctions make possible Kant's innovation: propositions that are both synthetic and a priori. His examples of such are 7+5=12, the statement every event has its cause, and the theorems of Euclidian geometry, among others.10 Kant argues (plausibly) that 7 and 5 can be added, but their conjunction yields nothing more than 7+5; the concept of equaling 7 is added (i.e., is synthetic), and this whole process is performed a priori.

Kant believes that pure mathematics, physics, and metaphysics all contain judgments which are synthetic a priori, and these judgments are also principles of their sciences.11 This is important for Kant because at this point in the Critique he is trying to establish metaphysics as a pure science of the understanding, with as much claim to its field as physics has to motion. Showing that the synthetic a priori functions the same way in all three of these sciences also establishes an analogy between metaphysics and math (or physics); no one doubts math's claim to numerical understanding, and analogously, Kant thinks, no one should doubt metaphysics' claim to understanding of the world.

The synthetic a priori also provides a basis on which Kant can build his theory of metaphysics: transcendental idealism (TIism). In TIism, the mind automatically projects onto the world a template. It is only through this template that we can understand the world. This is why we can't know things as they in themselves, but only insofar as they relate to us.12 This template (thereafter called the Categories) is deduced from basic Judgments we make in our understanding of things: whether they are universal, particular, or singular; affirmative, negative, or infinite; and so on. All of these Judgments are synthetic a priori-that is, they are justified not on the basis of experience, but conceptually.

III. Why is Geometry Synthetic a Priori?
Kant believes that Euclidian geometry consists almost entirely of synthetic a priori judgments, and explains his reasons for thinking so in two parts of the Critique. I will first consider why it is synthetic, then why it is a priori, and finally what the significance is of all this.

Kant thinks geometry is synthetic because he seemingly cannot find any principles of pure geometry [to be] analytic. 13 He gives an example of this: …the straight line between two points is the shortest…For my concept of straight contains nothing about magnitude…Therefore the concept of shortest is entirely added to the concept of a straight line and cannot be extracted from it…only by means of [intuition] is the synthesis possible. 14 Kant here claims that length is synthetically added to straightness in a mind-supplied (i.e., a priori) way. Presumably we are supposed to extrapolate from this example that all geometric theorems are synthetic a priori as well.

But this example does not illustrate Kant's point very well. Indeed, the judgment in his example is analytic-not synthetic. Both concepts, straightness and length, are contained in the concept of a line. A line, by definition, is a straight connection of two points not identical with each other (i.e., having a length of space between them). Thus we can turn Kant's example into an affirmative, explicit analytic judgment: a straight connection of two points having a length of space between them, is straight and has length.

Since Kant thereafter15 mentions other analytic principles in geometry, it seems as if he has actually provided us with more objections to his claim than support. But this, however, may not be the case. If we look at geometric theorems (such as his line example), we seem to find nothing but analytic principles. But if we consider the principles constituting those theorems, we can find synthetic ones. An example given earlier in this paper, all Euclidian triangles contain two right angles, illustrates this. The truth of containing two right angles in no way belongs to the concept of triangle-but it is inextricably connected to it.

Kant's Metaphysical Exposition of space (see Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, §2) shows that space has an a priori origin. His argument looks like this16:

1. Space is either an empirical concept or an intuition. 2. Space is not an empirical concept abstracted from experiences, because we can represent to ourselves only one space. 3. Experience is only possible through space. 4. Therefore, space must be a necessary a priori representation that underlies all outer intuitions.  5. Space is a pure intuition and essentially a unified whole. 6. Therefore, an a priori intuition underlies any concept of space. 7. Therefore, since geometry is the correct way of understanding space, geometry must be derived from a priori intuition.  8. Therefore, geometry is a priori.
Kant gives arguments, not reproduced here, for space as a priori at A23-24/B38 (the 1st and 2nd a priorities).

Kant immediately follows the Metaphysical Exposition with his Transcendental Exposition (§3), which is a best explanation for why space (and geometry) are a priori:

This intuition [of space] must, however, be encountered in us a priori, i.e., prior to any perception of an object; hence this intuition must be pure rather than empirical. For geometric propositions are one and all apodeictic, i.e., linked with the consciousness of their necessity-e.g., the proposition that space has only three dimensions. But propositions of that sort cannot be empirical judgments or judgments of experience; nor can they be inferred from such judgments. 17

Both of these references illustrate why Kant thought geometry was a priori, and we have previously shown why he thought it was also synthetic.

It remains to be shown why Kant's synthetic a priori geometry was important to his theory. Kant believed that space actually conformed to Euclidian geometry, just as the world conformed to his TIism. If the world were Euclidian, and geometry were comprised of synthetic a priori principles, then it follows that the world would have been understood correctly via synthetic a priori principles; thus, Kant's TIism would have been the proper way of understanding the world. It would have been a very strong argument in favor of TIism. Unfortunately for Kant, the early 20th Century proved that the world is not Euclidian, and so refuted one of his main arguments for his metaphysics.

We can see, then, (1) how Kant makes his distinction, (2) the results which follow from it, and (3) why and how he applied his distinction to geometry. These basic parts of the Critique provide the ground on which he can later build his Categories and other theories, and therefore have an essential function in the Critique as a whole.",82.52,36.36,18.85,10.66,13719
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Grice's Analysis of Metaphor and Irony,"In his Logic and Conversation 1, H. P. Grice describes the notion of implicature not in terms of what is actually said by the speaker, but rather in relation to what the speaker implied, suggested, meant, etc. by a particular utterance (p. 166). What is said often conveys more than just the literal meaning of the words spoken, and this additional information is the implicatum (i.e., that which is communicated without being explicitly stated).

Grice divides implicatures into the following general categories: conventional and non-conventional. A conventional implicature can be derived from the literal meaning of the speaker's words. For example, consider the following sentence: Bobby quit smoking. The meaning of the word quit results in the implicature that Bobby had a smoking habit (at some time prior to the utterance of the aforementioned sentence). Grice is not concerned with this type of implicature, but rather, focuses on a specific kind of non-conventional implicature, which he names conversational implicature (p. 167). Grice's definition of conversational implicature is expressed in relation to his Cooperative Principle and to a series of maxims that characterize typical conversation.

According to the Cooperative Principle, people engaged in any kind of verbal exchange customarily have certain expectations as to what constitutes an appropriate (or inappropriate) contribution to the conversation. These expectations are summarized in the Cooperative Principle, which can be defined as follows:

a rough general principle which participants will be expected (ceteris paribus) to observe, namely: Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged (p. 167).

The central idea is, as the name of the principle suggests, to cooperate with the other person so that effective communication can occur. Grice's conversational maxims specify how to comply with the Cooperative Principle. There are four categories to which the maxims belong. They are Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Manner. Two maxims are grouped under Quantity. The first states that the speaker should provide as much information as the situation requires. The second Quantity maxim calls for the speaker to give no unnecessary information. With respect to Quality, there is a general expectation (a supermaxim) that the speaker will contribute only that which is true. This expectation is made more precise by the following two maxims:

1) Do not say what you believe to be false. 2) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
(p. 168)

The Relation category has only one maxim, which requires a contribution to be relevant. (Note that this maxim is very similar to the second Quantity maxim.) The Manner category contains a supermaxim, which requests perspicuity, and four specific maxims, which require the speaker to be clear (avoid obscurity of expression), unambiguous, brief, and orderly (p. 168).

In order for a speaker's utterance (call it p) to result in a conversational implicature (q), three requirements must be met. First, the speaker must follow (or appear to follow) the Cooperative Principle and at least some of the maxims. The speaker must also be thought to believe (or mean) q, even though he said p. Finally, both the listener and speaker believe that the speaker believes that the listener is capable of reinterpreting p to arrive at q. When the speaker does not comply with a maxim, he cues a reinterpretation of p on the part of the listener.

The speaker has a variety of options when he decides not to satisfy a maxim. The speaker may discreetly violate the maxim (i.e., not fulfill the requirements of the maxim in such a way that the listener may not realize he has done so). Or the speaker may opt out of the Cooperative Principle (and the maxims) by openly refusing to be as helpful as is required by the situation. Grice also mentions that a clash (i.e., conflicting maxims) might force the speaker to satisfy one maxim at the expense of another. [However, as A.P. Martinich indicates (in his A Theory for Metaphor 2), a clash of maxims is more of a reason not to comply with a maxim than a way of failing to comply (p. 449).] Finally, a maxim can be flouted (i.e., violated in a very obvious way). If a conversational implicature is produced by the flouting of a maxim, then the maxim is said to be exploited by the speaker (i.e., the flouting of the maxim is used specifically for the creation of a conversational implicature) (p. 170).

The listener will reach a new interpretation of the speaker's utterance based on the following information: the literal meaning of the words; the Cooperative Principle and the conversational maxims; the specific circumstances of the conversation (i.e., the context); and background information related to the conversation. Finally, the interpretation is based on the assumption that both listener and speaker have access to (or are thought to have access to) all of the previously mentioned information.

According to Grice, irony and metaphor both result from the flouting of the Quality maxims. When the speaker uses irony in a conversation, he often says the opposite of what he truly believes. Such statements fail to satisfy the first maxim of Quality: Do not say what you believe to be false. Recognition of the blatant falseness of an ironic statement is supposedly what causes the listener to reinterpret the statement. For instance, Grice gives the example of an ironic statement made by a man whose (former) friend, X, has betrayed him. The man comments to a listener who knows what X has done, X is a fine friend. (p. 172). The listener will have no trouble understanding the irony of such a statement because he can easily recognize that it is contrary to what the speaker really believes of X.

Metaphor also is said to be created when the speaker says what he obviously does not believe. The speaker utters a truism, which means that he states that one thing is another (p. 172). The listener recognizes that the truism must be false, because it would be absurd if interpreted literally. He will then seek an alternative interpretation of the truism to make it meaningful, which is the metaphorical interpretation. Consider the famous example Juliet is the sun. Clearly the speaker does not mean literally that Juliet is the sun, but rather that she and the sun share some of the same characteristics (such as beauty, warmth, a certain significance, etc.).

Grice's analyses of both irony and metaphor are convincing, especially in relation to the examples in the above paragraphs. However, it seems that he has overlooked violations of the maxim of Relation as an indicator of irony and metaphor. In many situations, what actually prompts the listener to reinterpret a statement is not its falsehood, but rather the irrelevance of its literal meaning to the conversation. Consider the following example:

A: Casey thinks Michigan has the best academics in the country. 

B:  Yeah, he's a cheerleader for the university. 

The term cheerleader in B's remark could be understood in two distinct ways. Either Casey is literally a cheerleader for the university (i.e., he stands between sports fans and the athletes, trying to engage the crowd in peppy chants). Or, alternatively, saying Casey is a cheerleader could be interpreted metaphorically to mean that Casey avidly promotes the university (i.e., constantly seeks opportunities to say something good about the university). Taking into consideration what A said, the metaphorical interpretation seems more logical than the literal one. If B means that Casey is literally a cheerleader (i.e., a cheer-leader), then his comment is completely irrelevant to the conversation. However, as a metaphor, the term cheerleader seems like an appropriate response to A. The maxim of Relation seems to be what causes a second interpretation of the statement he's a cheerleader. Assuming that A does not know whether or not Casey is a cheer-leader , the truth value of the literal interpretation of B's statement is not important. If Casey really were a cheer-leader, A would still recognize that B is in violation of the maxim of Relation, and would thus be lead to a metaphorical understanding in order for B's comment to be meaningful in the conversation.

Along with ignoring the maxim of Relation as an indicator of irony and metaphor, Grice's analysis also ignores true metaphors. His account of how the listener reaches a metaphorical meaning relies on violation of the maxims of Quality, which suggests that it assumes all metaphors to be false. While most metaphors are indeed false, occasionally they are not. For example, consider the following newspaper headline: These bell-ringers really are cut out for the job. 3 At first glance, the phrase cut out may be interpreted as the stale, boring metaphor meaning apt or suitable (for a particular assignment). However, the subtitle of the article reveals that cut out (which normally is ridiculous if interpreted literally), in this case has a meaningful literal interpretation, in addition to the customary metaphorical evaluation. The subtitle reads: Mechanized cardboard characters man some Salvation Army kettles. A person reading the headline together with the subtitle would not be able to use the maxim of Quality to judge whether the phrase cut out is meant metaphorically or not. The literal significance does not violate the Quality maxim nor the maxim of Relation, because the cardboard characters are, in fact, cut out by their creators. Grice's account of metaphor does not seem to provide a sufficient explanation for true metaphors such as the one described above.

A similar vagueness in Grice's analysis of irony and metaphor is related to the way in which the listener arrives at the interpretation of the irony or metaphor that was intended by the speaker. An apparent failure to satisfy the Cooperative Principle and its maxims may be a hint to the listener that the speaker does not mean his statement to be understood literally. However, according to Grice, the reinterpretation finally reached by the listener must be based on the literal meaning of the words, the context and other items of background knowledge (p. 172). In his assessment of irony, Grice relies on the statement being so obviously false that nobody could actually believe it to be taken literally. Also, Grice claims that in order to understand the irony of the speaker's remark, the listener must recognize that the remark is contradictory to the true beliefs of the speaker. Thus, the listener must have sufficient background knowledge of the speakers beliefs to be able to detect irony. If the listener does not know the speaker very well, interpreting irony should be very difficult (if not impossible) unless the literal meaning of the statement is completely unbelievable. However, people often alert their audiences that they are speaking ironically through gestures, facial expressions, vocal inflection, etc. These techniques of communicating irony can replace the need for the listener to be familiar with the speaker's beliefs. Grice's account of irony does not take these indicators into consideration.

Returning to the metaphor of Juliet and the sun (from page 4), there are many characteristics that could be attributed to the sun, such as radiance, heat, power, eminence, color (red, orange, yellow), etc. Knowing the literal meaning of sun will not help the listener to select between the various characteristics associated with the word. The statements preceding and following the remark Juliet is the sun should tell the listener if the speaker is likely to mean that Juliet is particularly beautiful, or bright, or powerful. However, the exact meaning intended by the speaker could depart significantly from the literal meaning of the words spoken.

It becomes especially difficult for the listener to arrive at the speaker's intended meaning when the phrase in question is a live metaphor (as opposed to a dead metaphor which has become a cliché). Live metaphors are original creations of the speaker (i.e., the listener will never before have heard the metaphor). Therefore, the possible explanations of live metaphors are not as likely to appear in the listener's background knowledge. For example, if I say Juliet is the 10th planet, it is unclear whether I mean something like Juliet is distant, or Juliet is elusive, or Juliet is sought by many, etc. Thus, the listener has only the conversational context to reveal to him the speaker's intended meaning. If there is little context to explain a live metaphor, it is unlikely to be understood by the listener as the speaker intended.

The above paragraphs point out some of the difficulties of clearly and accurately defining irony and metaphor using Grice's account of conversational implicature. However, the criticism is not that he should extend his definition of metaphor and irony to include all of the cases mentioned above. Rather than becoming more specific about what exactly is a metaphor, or what exactly is irony, Grice's analysis should be more general. It is difficult to so precisely define something as extensive and ambiguous as metaphor and irony. Grice's view of metaphor and irony requires that they be literally false statements, and that their falsehood cause the listener to reach the speaker's intended meaning. However, as shown above, metaphor and irony need not always be blatantly false.

Moreover, it is doubtful that the listener will ever be able to fully understand the speaker's intended metaphoric/ironic meaning of a phrase. This is so because the listener's background knowledge of the speaker's beliefs will always be imperfect, and his interpretation of the context will always vary somewhat from the speaker's.

Finally, the speaker's use of relatively sophisticated metaphorical and ironical expressions may imply too many possible meanings. That is, some uses of metaphor and irony are so complex that they may cause the listener to arrive at a series of plausible alternatives, without knowing which one the speaker actually meant. However, the magic of metaphor and irony is their characteristic indeterminacy. Metaphors (and irony to an extent) are so appealing to the speaker because they can be used playfully. A conversation is much more engaging when the listener must interpret what is heard, because the act of interpreting meaning is a much more intense form of participation. Grice should not be expected to remove the ambiguities of irony and metaphor, thereby stripping them of their allure. Therefore, his definition of them should be more general and inclusive.

Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,The Morality of Commonality and Agent Specific Restrictions,"Act-utilitarianism holds that an act is right if and only if it is expected to produce a higher general utility than any other alternative action. John Hospers responds that act-utilitarianism is self-defeating and an unlikely comprehensive moral theory. He holds that there is one principle of fundamental importance which must be an indispensable part of every ethics-the principle of universality. If an act is right to do for one person facing a certain set of circumstances then it should also be right for any individual facing circumstances that are similar in all morally relevant ways. However, he argues, if individuals act optimifically in each isolated instance then the best outcome is not always reached. There are many instances where violating a general rule would maximize utility in one case, but widespread violations, would undermine the rule and produce a worse state of affairs. Examine Alan Gibbard's case of corporate fraud.

An employee [Martha] of a small company, alarmed that high levels of fraud in current business are leading to employees losing their pensions, discovers a way to embezzle from her employer, cover her tracks with an accounting fraud, and give the money to a short-funded organization for the prevention of embezzlement and accounting fraud. The scheme will risk leaving the employees of her company without pensions, but prevent widespread fraud and widespread loss of pensions. What ought she morally do?

Assume that the expected utility of Martha's scheme is greater than the expected utility of the status quo. That is, the amount and quality of benefit each person gets from retaining her pension is equal on average between groups and that (Pc*Nc) < (No). Pc is the probability that her coworkers will lose their pensions, Nc is the number of her coworkers that would be affected if the scam is discovered, and No is the number of people expected to be spared from losing their pensions as a result of the amount of money that Martha contributes to the short-funded organization. Let us further assume that the cost of the embezzlement to the firm and shareholders does not upset the inequality. Under these circumstances, imposing a risk upon her coworkers appears to be a more optimal course of action for Martha to maximize general welfare than is inaction. Therefore, act-utilitarianism should advocate that Martha has a moral obligation to defraud her employer.

Hospers may observe under the principles of act-utilitarianism and universality, every person in Martha's situation should also embezzle, evade detection, and contribute the money to the short-funded organization rather than recusing themselves from dubious behavior. However, widespread fraud to stop widespread fraud seems not only hypocritical, but self-defeating. Perhaps rule-utilitarianism provides a more viable comprehensive moral standard. It holds that acts may be right only if they do not violate a rule that's observance produces a better state of affairs than an absence of a rule or any other alternative rule. Accordingly, the course of action that would minimize corporate fraud and the hardship it produces would be for all to abide by a law forbidding fraud.

An act-utilitarian should initially respond that in Martha's case, as with most if not all cases of rule exceptions, the individual violation of the rule alters the circumstances for each to follow. The previous construal of act-utilitarianism's prescription would only be accurate if all actors were acting simultaneously, without knowledge of the other actors' intentions. Otherwise, the actors should immediately see the organization become well funded. The subsequent increase in the likelihood of both the actors' plot being discovered and their coworkers pensions being lost would cause the expected utility of late actors' contributions to decline. Act-utilitarianism would only prescribe Martha's scheme so long as each act continues to maximize utility. In direct response to Hospers, the prior violations of the rule often alter the circumstances faced by each subsequent actor in morally relevant ways that undermine the applicability of the principle of universality in many instances.

Secondly, undermining generally good rules or laws is a cost in and of itself. The value of the rule is undermined incrementally and to various degrees by each violation. Hospers suggests that more public violations undermine rules more than violations done in secret. The varying costs to the integrity of the rule should be factored into the utilitarian computation. If utility maximizing exceptions are made to the extent that the rule is completely invalidated, though the costs to the rule are properly accounted, then it seems that the existence of the rule would not have maximized utility in the first place. Act-utilitarianism would not advocate violating any rule that optimally should never be violated. Any other law should have an exception built into it allowing for utility maximizing behavior. Rule-utilitarianism collapses into thorough act-utilitarianism.

Individuals face similar drops in their utility when they lose their lifesavings gambling as when they lose their pensions due to fraud. It is true that gamblers at times get enjoyment from the game and that other factors may also generally indicate that losing a pension due to corporate fraud produces a worse state of affairs than does a similar loss due to gambling. However, imagine a case where the hardship faced by the gambler produces a vastly worse state of affairs than does the employee's loss. Perhaps the gambler lost everything while the employee had only a small portion of her savings in her pension. The gambler's hardship, while sad, does not seem to be as morally significant as does the employee's loss. We would not force the casino to give back the gambler's money because of the hardship that the gambler faces because she lost it-even if the gambler would get more utility from the money than would the casino (as is usually the case). However, we may demand that those guilty of corporate scandals resulting in the loss of employees' pensions repay the victims of their crimes. Even if the gambler's loss produces a worse state of affairs than does the worker's loss, the fact that the gambler consented to the risk of losing her savings seems to make her loss of lesser moral concern. I will argue that because the employees of Martha's firm did not consent to their involvement in the scheme, it would be immoral for Martha to subject them to the risk inherent in her plan and that Martha's obligation not to make her coworkers worse-off arises from the specific claims that they hold over her.

Any consequentialist should astutely observe that the employees of the other firms also did not consent to the risk. Additionally, more pensions would unjustifiably be lost if Martha fails to act. Because each loss of pension would detract from the general welfare at presumably the same average rate, a better state of affairs would be produced by preventing the most losses. Martha remains obligated to use her coworkers to protect the workers of other firms. Philippa Foot finds utilitarianism attractively haunting because it can never be right to prefer a worse state of affairs to a better.

But what does it mean to have a better state of affairs? Martha's coworkers do not seem to share in this improvement of general welfare that follows if she minimizes the number of people that lose their pensions. Utilitarianism rests upon an entity largely external from the perpetrator, suffer, benefactor, or beneficiary. Though each of these contributes to the overall utility, each interest is susceptible to complete overriding in order to maximize the total benefit. However, as Foot later argues, better or worse states of affairs are relative to the speaker. One will say a good thing where another says a bad thing, and it is the same state of affairs. How can it be determined that my good state of affairs is better for me than it is bad for you? Similarly, how do we know if my good state of affairs is better than yours is. It seems unlikely that it is simply majority based. Consider cases of justice. The number of plaintiffs should have no bearing on whether the defendant should be found guilty. Such interpersonal comparisons of welfare seem impractically difficult if not impossible. A better general state of affairs can only be conclusively defended when all are better off. Even this value judgment remains speaker relative. It simply holds for every speaker. As Foot concludes, it is counterintuitive to regard states as good or bad in regard to some nonexistent impersonal point of view.

Samuel Scheffler responds that no reference to a common state of affairs is needed to make the point that if something is bad, it seems worse the more it happens. He states that, even if Foot's claim is granted, the defender of agent-centered restrictions can hardly say that it is meaningless to assert that circumstances can arise in which a certain moral rule will be violated several times unless I violate it once. Consequently, Scheffler finds agent-centered restrictions to be paradoxical.

In the absence of a common good, from where else would obligation arise? Bernard Williams goes along with consequential depictions of failure to maximize general utility and argues for the self. He argues that because an agent's projects are what make life worthwhile to him and because an agent's morality is a particularly dear project that it is absurd to demand of such a man that he step aside from his own project… In this light Kai Neilson is correct in finding agent-centered restrictions to be little more than an unwillingness to carry out the difficult and dirty obligations of ethics. Such restrictions seem to be merely moral evasiveness.

However, framing the discussion in terms of the agent-centeredness biases the debate. We should rather be willing to examine any place from where the restrictions of Martha's actions may arise. A more viable alternative derivation of restrictions to maximizing good outcomes or minimizing the bad is found when the focus is instead placed on the sufferer. Judith Jarvis Thompson finds that deflecting bad things from one large group to another smaller group is only morally permissible when neither group has a higher claim against the bad thing from happening to them. While [Thompson] leaves it open precisely just what sorts of things might give the one more claim, she does state that there is no prima facie duty to refrain from interfering with the existing states of affairs just because they are existing states of affairs. This seems to bring us back to the original consequentialist objection to my restriction on maximizing behavior. In Martha's case, all employees equally share in their claim not to be made worse-off without their consent. None of the employees have acted in a way to forsake their claim to their pensions nor have any elevated claim against losing their pensions. Furthermore, coincidental susceptibility of some rather than others is of no moral significance. This suggests that because neither group of employees has more of a claim to their pensions there is no reason not to attempt to minimize the hardship.

It does not necessarily follow that because each employee has an equal claim against the bad from happening, each also has an equal claim on Martha for her to produce the state of affairs that favors him. As Foot notes, intuitively, we tend to find that failure to protect is less immoral than actively causing harm. To understand this moral intuition take Thompson's argument further and examine over whom the perspective victim has a claim with respect to negative versus positive rights. Negative rights cannot be applied to an impersonal common entity, because only unanimous inaction will leave my right respected. To say I have a negative right is to say that I have a claim over each actor, for that actor to refrain from violating my right. Positive rights are less specific. Most positive rights can require only one person to act while others fail to respond to my claim. Consider the case of the drowning child. Suppose many people are present when a helpless child falls into water and begins to drown. The child has claim over each person present to save him. It is true that if none acted that we all would be morally culpable for neglecting the child's claim over us collectively. However, if one person jumps in and saves the child while I do nothing, I am not morally responsible to the child for my inaction. Cases may be constructed in which positive rights also are actor-specific. However, negative rights are always absolutely so. Accordingly, perhaps the employees of other firms have a claim over all others to protect them from corporate deviants. This claim may obligate Martha to contribute to the short-funded organization and it could well be fulfilled by her fully funding the organization. However, this positive claim cannot arbitrarily mandate total extraction from a few other vulnerable individuals.

Martha's coworkers have a claim specifically over Martha that she ought not subject them to risk without their consent. Her coworkers claim over Martha cannot be fulfilled by any other. However, other employees' positive claims may be. Consequently, because Martha's coworkers have a specific claim over her restraint from forcing risk upon them, while the employees of other firms have a merely general claim over everyone, in which Martha only shares responsibility, to protect them from losing their pensions, Martha must first fulfill the claim specifically over her before she responds to a claim to which she owes only partial responsibility.

Consequently, I agree with Thompson that morality of deflecting something bad from one party to another depends on whether either party has more of a claim against it than another. By extending this argument to over whom the claim is applied it seems that we reach a consensus with Foot that the distinction between doing and allowing is a moral one. Because negative claims are specific to each individual, while each actor only shares in the obligation to fulfill positive claims, it is imperative upon the actor to respect negative claims primarily and positive claims secondarily.

Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,THE MEANING OF WRONG,"What is meant when we call an act wrong? I will examine the ways in which G.E. Moore, A.J. Ayer, and R.M. Hare answer this question. Then, I will argue for an answer to the question that utilizes elements from all three theories, and maintains that there is no one thing we mean when we call an act wrong.

In the article in our anthology, Moore does not explicitly address the question of what it means to call an act wrong, though he talks at great length about goodness. Goodness the non-natural quality which we assert to belong to a thing, when we say that the thing is good. 1 Intuition is the way in which we become aware of goodness, and badness as well, since badness is the same sort of property as goodness. In the excerpt, Moore does not discuss how right and wrong are to be determined, so I will have to trust the introductory remarks to the excerpt: Moore thinks that what is right must be defined in terms of the good. 2 From this, it is safe to assume that he thinks the wrong must be defined in terms of the bad. I take this to mean that acts are wrong if they possess the property of badness. So, on Moore's theory, to call an act wrong is to say that the act possesses the property of badness, where badness is non-natural and accessible through intuition.

Ayer, on the other hand, thinks something quite different. To say an act is wrong is merely to express a feeling about that act: For in saying that a certain type of action is right or wrong, I am not making any factual statement, not even a statement about my own state of mind: I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments. 3 To use Ayer's example, if I tell you that you were wrong to steal some money, I am just expressing my moral disapproval of the act. The statement You were wrong to steal some money says nothing more about the act than does the statement You stole some money. (421) An additional observation about Ayer's theory should be made. Words such as right and wrong are used to express our feelings, not assert that we have those feelings. Ayer likens the use of right and wrong to a cry of pain. Therefore, statements containing those words cannot be true or false, since they do not express genuine propositions. (422) According to Ayer, to call an act wrong is to express disapproval or similar feelings towards that act (but not assert that one disapproves of the act).

Like Ayer, Hare believes that moral statements are neither true nor false, but Hare thinks that when we use moral language we are doing more than merely expressing our feelings toward acts.4 To say that I ought to do something means that I really shall do that something. To use Hare's example, if I say that I ought to join the army-and I mean ought in the full-blooded sense-then I will join the army. This is what he calls the prescriptivity feature of moral statements. There is also the universalizability element, which means that when I say that I ought to do something, say, join the army, I think that anyone in my exact (relevant) circumstances ought to join the army as well. Hare chooses to discuss the word ought, rather than wrong, but he says that he could have spoken instead about other words, such as right and good. 5 I take it that to call an act wrong is to say that it ought not to be done. If I were to say that you ought not to have stolen that money, then what I mean is that you should not have stolen that money, and that anyone in similar circumstances (myself included) should not steal money. If someone calls an act wrong, then, it means that she believes she should not (and will not) do the act, nor should anyone in similar circumstances.

At this point, I would like to leave the discussion of Moore's, Ayer's, and Hare's theories, and turn to my own. When most people say that an act is wrong, I believe they mean several things. The first has to do with whether or not the act should be done, and by whom. If the moral statement is subject specific (It was wrong for me to steal that money.), then what is generally meant is that I ought not to have stolen the money, and that if I were to do it over again, I would not steal the money. Also, if I were ever in that position again, I would not steal the money. It does not necessarily mean that I believe that no one in similar circumstances should steal the money, as Hare thinks. It could be that the things I think are wrong for me to do, I do not think are not necessarily wrong for someone else in my circumstances to do.

If an act is wrong, most people believe that those acts ought not to be done, and they will not do those acts. However, it could be that although I believe it was wrong for me to steal that money, I would do it again. In this case, I would say that the person who thinks this either does not truly believe that wrong acts ought never to be done, or that the act, in her special circumstances, was not really that wrong, perhaps not even wrong at all. I believe that most people are of the sorts who believe that the wrongness of an act is somehow lessened in their particular circumstances. When a moral statement is not subject specific ('Stealing is wrong.'), then what is meant is either that stealing for everyone, at all times, in all circumstances ought not to be done, or that generally stealing ought not to be done, but there are special circumstances in which it is acceptable to steal.

It could be objected that it is not consistent to say that I should not do something, but that I cannot say anything about whether someone else should or should not do that something. To this I would reply that we are often not consistent in our judgments and actions, and that, in fact, it may not be inconsistent to say this. Suppose I say that it is wrong for me to steal some money, by which I mean I ought not (and will not) steal some money. I then say that while it is wrong for me to steal some money, it might not be wrong for someone else to steal it, because I do not know what sort of circumstances apply to his situation. What counts as similar enough circumstances? When all relevant characteristics, psychological and otherwise, are the same? Can that ever be the case, and how would I know? How do I know what relevant circumstances are? I could say that no one in relevantly similar circumstances should steal some money, but it might not be that there is ever anyone in similar enough circumstances for me to make that judgment. I might also hold that I do not know what the relevant circumstances would be, or if they ever obtain. For these reasons, I do not think that it need be inconsistent for me say that I ought not do a thing, while saying nothing about whether others in my circumstances ought not do that thing as well.

Let us turn back to the question of what people mean by wrong. When people call an act wrong, it is generally taken to mean that the act ought not to be done, but also that the act possesses the property of wrongness or badness. If I say that stealing is wrong, I mean that there is some quality (i.e. badness) that belongs to stealing that makes stealing wrong. Stealing is wrong can be read to mean Stealing possesses the property of badness, which makes stealing wrong, or I believe that stealing possess the property of badness, which makes stealing wrong. I am asserting what I take to be a factual statement about the world, or my state of mind, when I make moral statements. Now, I am not going to discuss what sort of property badness is, or whether it exists, because I do not believe that is important to the issue of what people mean when they make moral statements. When I say that stealing is wrong, what I mean is that stealing has the property of badness. I could be wrong about this, or my statement could be unverifiable, but in any case I mean to assert that stealing has the property of badness.

Another thing we sometimes mean when we say an act is wrong is that we disapprove of the act or, as Ayer suggests, that we are just expressing our disapproval. In most cases, though, I believe we are doing more than merely expressing our feelings; we are also asserting that we have those feelings. Saying that stealing is wrong can be the equivalent of saying that I disapprove of stealing, which is an assertion or feeling, not just an expression of it. There may be cases in which I say it is wrong for you to steal that money, but do not actually disapprove of it. In this case it would be false to read my statement as either an expression of my disapproval, or as an assertion of it. These are cases in which people label acts as technically wrong, but still acceptable to do. For example, we are inclined to say that while it was technically wrong for Jean Valjean to steal a loaf of bread, we do not disapprove of his action. This is similar to the discussion above of people who believe that the wrongness of an act is lessened in their particular circumstances.

Ayer, of course, would disagree with my suggestion that moral statements are not merely expressions of feelings, but are often assertions of those feelings as well. But I believe that most people would not be content to have their moral statements reduced to mere expressions of feeling, akin to a cry of pain. By saying an act is wrong, people mean to do more than express disapproval. They mean either to assert that they do disapprove, or to assert (whether the assertion be true or false) that the property of badness belongs to the act, or something similar. When not stated explicitly, these assertions are taken to be implied by the moral statement.

There is great variance in what we mean when we call an act wrong, and I believe that none of the three theories surveyed above adequately captures what we mean. Judging by what the theories have to say, I am not so sure that we can arrive at a neat, accurate, philosophically acceptable definition of what we mean when we call acts wrong.",0,0,53.44,56.82,9923
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,The Cartesian Circle,"Often referred to as the Cartesian Circle, Descartes presents a very problematic argument about the existence of God. He presupposes the truth of the premise of clear and distinct perception in order to prove the existence of God. Then once he proves the existence of God, he uses it to prove the validity of the clear and distinct perception premise; that whatever we clearly and distinctly perceive must be true. In the excerpt on page 105 of Descartes' Meditations, he provides the missing explanation of the logic behind the idea that anything that someone clearly and distinctly perceives is true.

The first premise that Descartes provides is that there exist some things that we can never think of without believing they are true. Descartes refers to these things as those that we clearly and distinctly perceive. When we do try to imagine that these things are false, it simply does not make sense. Descartes gives two examples of this: 1) I exist so long as I am thinking and 2) what is done cannot be undone. We can try to imagine these premises being false, however when we get into details about how they could be false we quickly lose our way. As a result, Descartes concludes that every time we recall these ideas into our minds, we believe that they are true.

The next premise that Descartes provides is that we cannot doubt an idea without simultaneously thinking of it. He does not go into much detail about this argument, because it is very much an obvious point to make. In order to decide that we do not agree with something, we must first recall it into our mind; we cannot simply disagree with something without first thinking of the idea. Although this idea is seemingly very obvious, it is nonetheless an important premise for his later conclusion.

Descartes then draws from these two premises the conclusion that any time we doubt something that we clearly and distinctly perceive, we at the same time believe that it is true. According to the second premise, in order to doubt an idea, we first bring that idea into our heads. However, according to the first premise, we are instantaneously convinced of the truth of the premise when we bring the idea into our head because we clearly and distinctly perceive it. So when we doubt any of these ideas, we also believe the ideas at the same time.

A third premise that Descartes uses is that it is impossible to both doubt something and believe it to be true at the same time. These are mutually exclusive states of mind; it is a logical impossibility to both doubt and believe something to be true simultaneously. Overall this premise is very obvious, but it is required for Descartes' argument to be complete.

Using this third premise and the first conclusion, Descartes draws his final conclusion: we can never doubt what we clearly and distinctly perceive. The three premises together lead us to a logical impossibility, one element of the premises must be logically impossible. To further his argument, he decided that the impossible element is the act of doubting the things which we clearly and distinctly perceive. Doubting these ideas leads us to an impossible state of both belief and doubt, so it we simply cannot doubt them.

The reason why this excerpt fits in with the main purpose of the Meditations is that it finally gives a clear definition of clear and distinct perception. Throughout the Meditations, Descartes builds up the argument that if we can clearly and distinct perceive something, we can know that it is true. However, he does not go into many details about what it means to clearly and distinctly perceive something. But he finally defines it as that which is so transparently clear and at the same time so simple that we cannot ever think of them without believing them to be true (1). This is a very clear definition that would have been useful earlier on in the Meditations.

In addition, Descartes' response to the objector gives us another proof of the clear and distinct perception argument. As we have already established in class, the argument is flawed on many different levels. But Descartes still remains absolutely convinced of the validity of the clear and distinct perception argument, so he attempts to advance another separate explanation for it. In it, Descartes provides us with a clear and thought-out argument about why it is impossible to doubt that which we clearly and distinctly perceive.

Although Descartes argument about clear and distinct perception has its problems, this excerpt helps the reader understand the concept more. As we discussed in class, Descartes never completely explains why he is not creating what has been referred to as the Cartesian Circle. But this did not stop him from advocating it as a way for us to definitively know that God exists. Descartes was very sure that the argument of clear and distinct perception was powerful and this excerpt lets us inside of his head on the idea. As much as his argument for clear and distinct perception has aligned, one cannot argue that he did not put any thought into it.",0,47.35,33.69,33.19,5069
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Reliabilism,"Reliabilism is a nonevidentialist theory of knowledge that says that we can have knowledge if we have justified true beliefs and are using reliable processes or methods to develop these beliefs. The reliability of these processes used gives us a clear indication of whether or not we will result in knowledge.

Alvin Goldman, the original proponent of reliabilism, starts its explanation by discussing what does not give us knowledge. After describing several processes that cause us to obtain faulty beliefs, Alvin Goldman says, What do these faulty processes have in common? They share the feature of unreliability; they tend to produce error a large portion of the time (1). Goldman explains that we simply cannot trust certain types of processes because experience has shown us that they do not lead us on a path to dependable knowledge.

Goldman then goes on to contrast reliable and unreliable processes used to gain knowledge. He describes certain processes that will usually lead to knowledge and says of them, What these processes seem to have in common is reliability: the beliefs they produce are generally true (1). These processes have shown themselves to be dependable most of the time and as a result, can be counted on to lead to knowledge. The biggest difference between processes that lead to knowledge and processes that do not is their reliability.

After discussing all of these ideas, Goldman summarizes his theory of reliability by saying, The justificational status of a belief is a function of the reliability of the process or proceses that cause it, where (as a first approximation) reliability consists in the tendency of a process to produce beliefs that are true rather than false (1). This is a formal way to say that a reliable process gives us strong justification and an unreliable process does not give us justification. As a result, we can only have knowledge when we use a reliable process and have justification for the belief.

The first case in which knowledge can be obtained deals with belief-independent processes. These processes are not based on other beliefs; an example of this would be seeing a color of a large object in plain view. For belief-independent processes, If S's belief in p at t results from a belief-independent process that is reliable, then S's belief in p at t is justified (1). Essentially, this says that someone can obtain knowledge by using a reliable process that does not depend on any previous beliefs.

The second case deals with belief-dependent processes. These processes use existing beliefs and result in new beliefs that have been extracted from the previous ones; an example of this is using memory to make a judgment on something. In this case, If S's belief in p at t results from a belief-dependent process that is conditionally reliable, and the beliefs the process operates on are themselves justified, then S's belief in p at t is justified (1). Knowledge in this case comes from 1) using a process that will result in true beliefs if the premises used by this process are true and 2) feeding true premises into this process. An example of this is using sound logical deduction with true premises; sound logical deduction is a reliable process, but only if the premises used are true.

One note that must be made is that determining whether or not a process is reliable often turns out to be very subjective. Although there is no exact way to explain what a reliable process is, generally people will understand whether a certain process is reliable or not. But still it is very hard to understand how many times a process can give us wrong beliefs before we deem it unreliable. There is no way to determine a percentage of correct beliefs provided by a process for us to compare reliability and set a standard, so people must simply use their reasoning to determine whether or not a process is reliable given all of the evidence throughout their lives. But in the end, this ambiguity is simply part of reliabilism and cannot be avoided due to the lack of quantitative power within this theory of knowledge.

One counterexample to reliabilism follows. Confused has an interesting problem, where every time he sees red, he thinks that he sees green. One day, his neighbor is testing a color-scrambling ray that causes everyone around to think that they are seeing red when in fact they should be seeing green. While his neighbor is testing this ray, Confused's other neighbor walks in with a green shirt. The color-scrambling ray causes Confused's mind to process red colors, which due to his aforementioned problem makes him think that he is seeing green.

This case is a counterexample to reliabilism because it is a reliably formed belief that isn't justified. Although Confused's color detection may not seem as though it is reliable, we know that every time this color scrambling ray is on, he will see green and actually think that it is green. As a result, in this specific case his color detection is 100% reliable. However, this belief clearly isn't justified because of Confused's problem of seeing red and thinking that he sees green. Even though in his mind it may be justified, this justification is clearly mistaken and there is no other justification available. So in this case, Confused obtains knowledge through a reliably formed belief but without the necessary justification.

In order to amend reliabilism to escape this counterexample, it is important that justification simply isn't always necessary to obtain knowledge in reliabilism. That is, using a 100% reliable belief-independent process does not need the normal amount of justification and simply can lead to knowledge directly. Even though this counterexample may not even be a problem to Goldman's reliabilism, it certainly is a problem to our reliabilism because of our assumption that a reliable process is necessary in addition to justification. As a result, I would amend the justification clause for belief-independent processes to be: If S's belief in p at t results from a belief-independent process that is reliable, then S's belief in p at t is justified. Otherwise, if we are using a 100% reliable process, we can have knowledge without previous justification. This would provide us a back-door to avoid the necessity of justification in hypothetical cases where we can be 100% sure that we are using a reliable process and we gain knowledge, but do not have justification.",0,0,5.66,0,6448
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Final Cause and Necessity in Nature,"When Aristotle presents his theory of causation and the controversial final cause (telos), he is confronted with a serious objection from Empedocles, a sort of determinist of Aristotle's time: Why not suppose that nature acts not for something [a telos]…but [only] of necessity? (198b18). That is, why must we even posit goals and ends as true causes- rather than, say, mere place markers for human reference- if the natural world appears to proceed from necessary conditions (the hot, the cold, and each element have a certain nature [198b10]) to necessary final states? Aristotle presents an explanation of rain that is characteristic of this objection:

Zeus's rain does not fall in order to make the grain grow, but of necessity. For it is necessary that what has been drawn up is cooled, and that what has been cooled and becomes water comes down, and it is coincidental that this makes the grain grow. Similarly, if someone's grain is spoiled on the threshing floor, it does not rain in order to spoil the grain, and the spoilage is coincidental.

This example, and the general account of necessity as the sole cause in nature, can be analyzed- and hopefully rebuked- in terms of Aristotle's theory of causation (194b16). There are four distinct, but not necessarily mutually-exclusive, types of causes: material, formal, efficient, and final. Matter is said to be the material cause of that which is constitutes. In contrast, a form is the formal cause of that which embodies or receives that form, since the form is the genera of the account of the essence (194b27) of that object. Aristotle's efficient cause is the one which most resembles contemporary usage of the term, since it is the source of the primary principle of change (194b30) and thus the initiator of the change (194b32) in some object. Finally, and most controversially, is the final cause (telos). This is the end towards which something strives, and it is considered to be the cause not only of the original something but also all the intermediate steps that are for the [given] end (194b36). There is a second class of distinguishing properties of causes: coincidental (sumbebekos, lit. falling together) causes, necessary causes, and usual causes. The difference between the second two is often ignored by Aristotle since it is small in comparison with the difference between both term and coincidence: whereas no result of luck or chance (sumbebekos) comes to be either always or usually  (198b36). Also, Aristotle acknowledges that even a necessary cause may fail once in a while and miss the mark (199b38). In any case, the key distinction for Aristotle is that of coincidental and essential (necessary or usual, non-coincidental) causes.

Aristotle replies to Empedocles objection in a very elegant manner that seems to foresee Darwin's work on evolution by over a millennium. He argues that if Empedocles considers natural things and processes to be as they are of necessity, why not suppose, then, that the same is true of the parts of natural organisms (198b23) For example, Aristotle presents the case of animal teeth, which are sharp in the front (well adapted for biting [198b24]) and broad in the back (useful for chewing food [298b25]). Aristotle comments that on [Empedocle's] view…this (useful) result was coincidental, not what they were for (199b25). In a final blow to the determinist, Aristotle extends the example to its logical conclusion:

On this view, then, whenever all the parts came about coincidentally as though they were for something, these animals survived, since their constitution, though coming about by chance, made them suitable <for survival>. Other animals, however, were differently constituted and so were destroyed; indeed they are still being destroyed, as Empedocles says of the man-headed calves.

Aristotle has thus shown that the parts of organisms that enable them to survive in their environment cannot be explained away by means of a mere necessary relation, for example, between the constituent elements (the hot, the cold, and each element [198b10]) of these parts. By extension to all natural things, we see that we find, then, among things that come to be and are by nature, things that are for something  (199a8). That is, the student of nature must study ends in order to account for (at least) some of the observed natural processes, and so final causes are required in a theory of nature.

Continuing on, Aristotle goes on to explain the relationship between natural necessity and final causes. He asserts that necessity is at most a material or efficient cause in nature, since necessity in natural things belongs to the material cause and to the motions of matter (200a30). This is significant because final (and formal) causes lie in a relationship of superiority to merely material (and efficient) causes. Just as the game of billiards cannot be completely explicated in terms of the matter (material cause) and movement (efficient cause) of billiard balls, but rather some account of goal-oriented play must be involved, Aristotle claims that an account of nature must consider goal-oriented, for something causes. The swallow and its nest, the spider and its web, plant leaves and roots, are all evidence of end-oriented behavior for Aristotle, and he equates this type of causation with form; since the form is the end, and since everything else is for the end [see 194b36 quoted above], the form must be what things are for (198b33). This account of nature sees natural objects as forms and final causes in themselves, as Aristotle says when a doctor applies medical treatment to himself-that is what nature is like (199b33). In short, natural things' principle of change is one of expressing some end and in doing so enabling further expression of that, or some new, end.

The account above of final causes leaves unclear the issue of whether all organisms exhibit telos-oriented behavior or only some. This ambiguity is present in the text [see footnote 107, 199a4), and pertains to the scope of final causation. It may be the case that certain (perhaps simple) organisms are not actually moved by final causes, but rather have principles of change- and all natural organisms do by 192b13- that are governed solely by necessity. We could imagine these organisms as prisoners of the laws of physics, whose every motion is explainable completely in terms of necessary relations among basic elements- a reductionist dream. This, however, would lead to the paradoxical statement that such natural organisms lacked a form (by 198b33 above), a serious concern for a theory of nature. Given this apparent paradox, it is not clear why Aristotle does not make the stronger claim and instead settles with the weak we find, then, among things that come to be and are by nature, things that are for something (199a7).

A similar argument could be put forth for non-organic but natural phenomena like rain and hurricanes, which often don't seem to admit of a for something explanation. If Zeus' rain does not fall of necessity but rather for something, is it also true that a fierce tornado which causes death and destruction- as they do either always or usually (198b35)- killed its unfortunate victims for something and not by mere coincidence? Empedocles may be right in his objection that Zeus' rain is necessary, and the coincidence of grown/ruined grain- or tornado victims- is expected in the same way that a salsa-dancing house builder is coincidentally the efficient cause of a built house for being a salsa dancer. In other words, Aristotle's attempt to assign a something for which Zeus' rain falls (ie. the growing of crops) may be like seeing causation where there is only coincidence or luck. This concern can be extended, although admittedly its difficult, to the realm of natural organisms and their parts by asserting that the forms observed in the natural world are not ends (or the striving for ends) but in reality simply optimal and necessary solutions to problems posed by physical laws and the organism's environment. A piece of contemporary evidence for this might be convergent evolution: when two unrelated and non-interacting organisms independently evolve to possess similar or identical structures like the eye. If one were to attempt to apply Aristotle's theory of causation to this problem, the idea of the form of the eye as a final cause might be denied on the grounds that such organisms could not possibly have displayed the same goal-oriented behavior in vastly differently environments, but rather the necessary laws of optics and the properties of certain materials found in the eye conspired to make this structure in each case. The likeliest case is that part of the explanation of the eye, or any natural organism, will depend upon its material (necessary) characteristics, and another part will depend on form-related final causes.

Despite any apparent ambiguity or equivocation, Aristotle's theory of causation is particularly good at explaining why final causes are an essential ingredient in the vocabulary of nature. And while it is still an open question for the student of nature today how much of the natural world is governed by necessity, how much by coincidence/luck and how much by final causes, it is clear that Aristotle's end-oriented mentality has experienced a renewal in modern evolutionary theory. It is easy to see why: as long as reason calls us to investigate, the question of why? will always be, at least in part, a teleological one.",0,0,0,0,9532
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,The composition of the Earth,"Thales, argued to be the first philosopher by some, proposed that everything in the universe was formed from water. Perhaps the strongest argument for this proposition is the fact that water transforms. As Ring notes, the development of other objects from that water could be a transformation, rather than a replacement of original stuff (Ring 20). Through an examination of water, one may quite clearly see how it can transform from a solid phase (ice), a liquid phase (water), and a gas phase (water vapor). Therefore, it can be possible to see how this substance might have the potential to form every living thing of the universe. However, Anaximenes did not agree with Thales' theory in which everything in the universe is created out of water.

According to the edition of Greek Philosophy edited by Allen, Anaximenes argued that, the primordial unity is to be treated as stuff, a matter out of which thing s are made. The diverse elements of the world are to be attributed to changes in this primitive matter (Allen 4). In other words, Anaximenes believed that the universe was created from some object that would transform to create other objects. In this sense, it seems like this theory is not much different from the transformation of water, used to explain Thales' theory of water creating the objects of the universe. However, Anaximenes claims that the object that is transformed is not water, as Thales suggests, but rather that it is air.

While it seems as though the air in Anaximenes' theory could be easily replaced by Thales' water, upon further examination of Anaximenes' theory we see how this could not be the case. As noted in Ring, it is possible that Anaximenes didn't believe that water was the element that created all things of the universe since, it is difficult to see how fire could be derived from water (Ring 31). It appears that water does not create fire, but rather it destroys fire. And if water can not create fire, then, how could it be the element in the universe that forms all things? Therefore, although it seems as though Thales' water could replace Anaximenes' air, one can see the predicament that arises when determining how water could create fire. So, Anaximenes determined that the universe could not be formed from water. However, it is now important to look at how air can be transformed into different objects.

In an observation, Anaximenes noted that when lips are compressed the air blown out of a person's mouth will be cool, but when the lips are relaxed and the mouth is open that air becomes warm (Allen 33). In this observation Anaximenes noted that air possessed qualities of differing temperatures, according to him, based on their density. Cool air was denser, since it was compressed from lips, where hot air was less dense, since it came from lips that were loose. With this observation, Anaximenes could have determined that density caused air to transform into different objects. If this was the case, then less dense air would form fire and as air would be compressed it would form wind, water, and rock (Allen 4). Through observations, Anaximenes notes the density properties of air (along with temperature differences) and proposes this to be the method in which air can transform to create all things of the universe.

Now that the basic principles of Anaximenes' theory have been stated, it is necessary to analyze it. It is important to determine whether is ideas are plausible when further trying to understand his theory. If the reason Anaximenes proposed air as the element that formed the universe was because water could not create fire, then I think that his claim is understandable. If water can't create fire, and fire can't create water, then how could either object be the element that creates all things? Therefore, it makes sense to assume that their must be some other element or thing that has created the objects in the universe. However, why should air be chosen? There seem to be a multitude of other things that could have caused the formation of things in the universe. However, the item that forms the universe seems to have to have the ability of transformation. If it doesn't have the ability to transform, it would seem that that element or object would remain the same throughout history. Therefore, it would be difficult to determine how that object was able to form the universe if it never changed into different forms or states. Therefore it makes sense to assume that this element is water (since it clearly transforms), but if water can't create fire, then it makes sense for Anaximenes to choose air as this element.

By performing the experiment of blowing air, an individual can feel the difference in temperature on their hand. It isn't as though the air inside them has changed in any state, besides the method that they blew it out. So it does appear that air changes in form when the density of it changes. And due to changing density, as mentioned earlier, Anaximenes proposed that air could compress enough to form wind, liquid water, and stone. This proposition also could make sense. I'm sure that most individuals have walked outside on a cool day when there has appeared to be somewhat of a mist in the air. In addition, since I have traveled to Arizona before, I have felt the dry heat that is present in the desert air. Therefore, it seems as though air has the property to transform, and perhaps if it becomes hot enough or cool enough it can have the potential to form wind, water, stone, and fire. In that sense, Anaximenes' theory about the compression of air seems to make sense. However, I think the transformation property of air is not as clear as Anaximenes had hoped.

At this point, it appears that there is a large amount of support in Anaximenes theory. By analyzing his statements we can see that it does seem unlikely that water could produce fire, and that air may serve as an alternative theory. However, someone supporting Thales' idea may have a different opinion on the transformation abilities of air. As said earlier, seeing the transformation property of water is quite clear. If you turn on the faucet at home you can see liquid water running from it, pour it into a glass and place that water in a cold environment and you can see frozen water form, place that water into a pot and apply enough heat, and you can see water vapor created in the form of steam. However, it is not so easy to see the transformation properties of air. Sure, air can have different temperatures, and perhaps even different densities, but does that give it the ability to transform? I have seen water transform several times in my life, however I have never seen air compressed and cool enough to form a stone, nor have I seen air become hot enough to create fire. In that sense it seems that the transformation abilities of air are much more complex and challenging to observe. In fact I'm willing to wager quite a bit, that no one has seen air compressed to the point of creating stone. And if no one has seen air transform, it is challenging to assume that his has the property of transformation, even if it does appear to change temperature with transformation. Therefore Anaximenes' theory may not be as clear and supported as it once seemed earlier in this paper.

However, just because it is challenging to observe the actual transformation of air, that does not mean that air can not transform. In addition, although we have seen water change states, I doubt anyone has anyone seen solid ice turn into rock. Therefore, it really isn't clear whether air or water is the element that created the objects in the universe. Perhaps one of them is this element, or perhaps there is some other object or element that has formed the universe (and the objects in it). At this point, though, it is challenging to determine whose theory may be correct. That does not mean, however, that the strengths and weaknesses of each argument should not be examined and investigated.",48.84,25.13,8.08,9.02,7993
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,God and Omnipotence,"According to traditional theology God must be omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, meaning that he must be all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good. While all three properties are important when attempting to understand the nature of God, in this paper we will examine the property of omnipotence. Two theories of omnipotence will be examined, one in which God can do anything and everything, and one in which God can do anything and everything that is logically possible. It is important to examine and analyze each definition of omnipotence to assist in determining what it means for God to be omnipotent, which, can further help understand the nature of God.

The first definition of omnipotence that will be examined in this paper is the idea that God can do anything and everything. Rosenkrantz and Hoffman define this version of omnipotence as, The notion of having it with in one's power to bring about any state affairs (71 Coursepack). As was discussed in lecture, this definition of omnipotence seems intrinsic. If, according to traditional theology, God must be all powerful, then he should be able to do anything and everything. According to this definition, God could have the power to create the sun, create life, and even make this paper write itself. In addition, if we followed this definition, God could also make 3+7= grapefruit, make a stone that is too heavy for himself to lift, or he could be able to stand and sit at the same time. While all the following seem to be impossible and nonsensical, this definition suggests that God can still create these events because he can do anything and everything. And although we may not understand it, it may not be our place to say whether or not God can do the above.

However, Thomas Aquinas and several other philosophers believed that this definition of omnipotence seemed inaccurate. It is difficult to imagine how God could create a stone that he himself could not lift, as was noted in the paradox of the stone in Rosencrantz and Hoffman's article (Coursepack 27). In addition to this contradiction Aquinas noted several other contradictions that appeared to limit God's omnipotence, including the fact that God can not sin, nor deny himself (Coursepack 68). Due to these contradictions that were noted in the coursepack articles it appears that God can't be omnipotent according to the original definition that Descartes supported. If God is not omnipotent according to the original definition, then two possibilities could arise. Firstly, God may not exist since it appears he can't be omnipotent (and therefore wouldn't have one of the three necessary qualities), or omnipotence should be defined differently to better explain what is possible. Aquinas seemed to choose the second option and, so, we have a new definition of omnipotence to examine.

According to Aquinas, the fact that God is omnipotent should be understood that, God can do all things that are possible and these things are limited to what can be consistently described (Coursepack 69). While this definition does not appear to differ that much from the first definition of omnipotence, that is not the case. According to this definition, God can still do everything, but everything is only what is logically possible. In other words, it isn't comprehendible to be able to sit and stand at the same time since those actions appear to be contradictory. Therefore that action appears to be logically impossible. As Aquinas notes, if a contradiction exists, It is more appropriate to say that those things can not be done, than [to say] that God can not do them (Coursepack 68). This definition may appear to limit what God can do, however, that is not the case. According to this definition, God can still do everything possible, however, the realm of what is possible is limited to what is logically possible, or according to Aquinas, what can be consistently described. Therefore, God can't create a stone that is to heavy for himself to lift, because that is logically impossible, but, if he desired, he could allow a rainstorm to occur next Thursday because that is logically possible, he could even make it rain giant strawberries instead of water if he wanted to, but he could not let me sit and stand at the same time no matter how much I wanted to, because it is logically impossible to do so.

After looking at both theories it may seem challenging to determine, which theory may be stronger, and, thusly, which definition of omnipotence is accurate when describing the nature of God. However, when investigating the first definition of omnipotence one can see that according to that definition God would be able to do things that appear to be contradictions. Since it seems improbable that God could create a stone so heavy, that he, himself, can't lift, or that he could cause an individual to sit and stand at the same time, it may be appropriate to assume that the first definition of omnipotence, where God can do absolutely everything, isn't as strong as the second definition.

Therefore, it may be best to believe that God's omnipotence follows the second definition of omnipotence. As Aquinas noted, God can do all thins that are possible absolutely, and things are possible absolutely if the predicate isn't incompatible with the subject (coursepack 68). Therefore, if the predicate and subject are incompatible, they are not possible absolutely. So, according to this definition an object can't be neon green and colorless, those traits are incompatible, and thusly incomprehensible. Since our logic is our method of reasoning, it is understandable why we may assume that contradictions that don't follow our logic may not fit in the realm of possibility, since they are incomprehensible. And, if these contradictions and nonsensical things aren't in the realm of logical possibility, then not even an omnipotent being could do them. Therefore, in the second definition, God is still all powerful, since he can do everything that is in the realm of logical possibility. Therefore, this definition doesn't appear to limit the power of God, as some may suggest, but rather it accounts for the illogical contradictions that were stated in page one of this paper.

However, while it may appear that God's omnipotence fits the second definition, it is still important to examine the first definition when deciding if God is omnipotent. As was stated earlier in the paper, the first definition of omnipotence is the capability of a being to do absolutely everything and anything. This definition includes items both in the realm of logical possibility and those outside of the realm, including contradictions. As was discussed earlier, it was difficult to imagine the possibility that God could create a stone so heavy that he himself could not lift, or the fact that he could allow a statement such as 3+7=grapefruit, when such events seem irrational and improbable to us. Therefore, the second definition eliminated these events and deemed them as outside of the realm of possibility, because, we could not understand them.

However, eliminating these from the realm of possibilities could have consequences. Just because these events seem improbable and irrational to us, does not mean that they are improbable or irrational to God. By deeming these events as illogical we limit the realm of possibility, and thus, it appears that somehow, we limit the power of God. Yes, according to the second definition, God can still do everything, but we have set a limit on what everything is. This appears to be problematic to me, since I have a hard time believing that we, as humans, understand everything that is possible. For example, I don't understand how an MRI, works, as far as I'm concerned little men could be inside the machine making an imprint of a person's brain, yet I know it does work as many medical professionals rely on this machine on a daily basis. Similarly, I may not understand how God could create a stone so heavy that he himself can't lift it, but maybe God understands how. Just because one person may not understand something, or may think that an event is impossible, it doesn't mean that someone else doesn't understand this event or think that it is impossible. In that sense, although humans may not understand some of these contradictory statements that were mentioned in the paper that does not suggest that God may not understand these events, or that he is unable to accomplish these tasks. So, while the second definition may seem to eliminate the problem of irrational and contradictory events that are incomprehensible to us, the first definition of omnipotence seems to look at those events, and suggest that, while we may not understand them, who are we to say that they are outside of the realm of possibility. If this is the case, the second definition, could in fact limit the power of God, and so one may suggest that even though they don't understand it, God's omnipotence follows the first definition.

While the first definition of omnipotence may suggest that it is not the place of humans to define what is possible, the second definition does seem more rationale, and thus may be stronger when determining God's omnipotence. However, because of the discrepancies between both definitions, it is not my place to conclude what God's omnipotence resembles. Rather, I attempted to present both cases, and make arguments for why either definition may be an accurate description of God's omnipotence.",100,67.58,43.64,52.84,9508
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Question 9: Determinism and Free Will,"At first glance, the question as to whether human actions are freely performed elicits an obvious and emphatic answer: yes. The issue is complicated, however, when we consider the doctrine of determinism, which holds that all events are caused by previous conditions in the world and the laws of nature. Incompatibilists interpret this doctrine to mean that, if determinism is true, then free will is a mere illusion. Compatiblisits, on the other hand, maintain that free will is perfectly concordant with the doctrine of determinism. An analysis of arguments from both perspectives will lend credence to the compatibilist position, on the grounds that it raises fewer and less consequential objections. However, the problem of compatibility can be avoided altogether if an argument is based on the pragmatic conception of belief.

In order to comprehend and assess the incompatibilist argument, it is first necessary to define determinism and evaluate its claims. Determinism is the view that all events, acts, and choices are caused by previous conditions of the world and the laws of nature. While Newtonian physics has traditionally been cited as a justification for determinism, quantum mechanics now suggests that the world is in fact indeterminate. Determinism may still hold, however, if randomness is accounted for in the laws of nature. Yet the most convincing evidence for determinism comes from empirical studies in psychology and neurobiology, which suggest that all mental events (e.g. decisions) are correlated with, if not caused by, brain events (e.g. neural activity). As it is known that brain events are caused by physical events, it is believed that physical events influence or even cause all mental events. If this were true, then all decisions and subsequent actions could be attributed to causes external to the agent. Empirical evidence therefore supports deterministic claims.

As with determinism, it is necessary to clarify the concept of free will in order to evaluate the incompatibalist argument. An agent (A) is said to have performed an action (X) freely provided that there was some alternative to X that A could have chosen and that, if chosen, would have been performed. For instance, consider a driver at a T-junction with the option of turning left or right. The driver weighs his options and eventually turns right. This scenario satisfies the requirements of free will, as the driver's decision to turn right entailed the alternative of turning left, which certainly would have occurred, had the driver so desired. However, if construction prevented the driver from turning left, or if the driver had decided to turn right but was forced left by a malfunction of the steering mechanism, then the driver would not be considered a free agent. Thus, free will requires the availability of a viable alternative to a given action.

Incompatibilists argue that free will and determinism are incompatible. If determinism is true, they argue, it must be the case that there is never a viable alternative to the action in question. Recall the example of the driver who stopped at a T-junction and decided to turn right. Determinists would claim that the driver could not have done anything other than turn right, given the past condition of the world and the laws of nature. While turning left seemed like a viable option to the driver, this feeling of freedom is merely an illusion in the eyes of a determinist. The alleged incompatibility of determinism and free will is especially troubling if determinism is taken as fact, as it is widely accepted that moral responsibility requires free will. Thus, the hard determinist believes that moral responsibility is impossible, given that determinism is true and incompatible with the notion of free will.

Roderick Chisholm, a notable libertarian, agrees that determinism and free choice are incompatible, yet denies the determinist conclusion by rejecting the doctrine of determinism. According to Chisholm, there are two possible types of causation: transeunt causation and immanent causation (Chisholm, 440). Transeunt causation, which is consistent with determinism, refers to instances in which one event causes another, as when the wind blows a tree across the road. Immanent causation, which contradicts determinism, refers to instances in which an agent causes an event or state of affairs. Chisholm argues that in these instances the agent is the sole cause of a given action by subconsciously triggering a brain event that ultimately leads to an observable action. (Chisholm, 441) This notion directly contradicts the determinist idea that all events are caused by previous events in conjunction with the laws of nature. Chisholm is therefore able to argue that individuals are able to act freely in instances of immanent causation and can be held responsible for their actions in these situations.

There are two serious objections to Chisholm's argument. The first objection holds that, if individuals were able to subconsciously cause brain events, then we would expect to see brain events occurring independently of physical events (Charlow, 2008). Critics contend that this contradicts our best understanding of the brain based on empirical studies in psychology and neurobiology. Furthermore, the existence of immanent causation contradicts the doctrine of the causal closure of the physical, a methodological cornerstone of scientific inquiry that holds that every physical event is caused by some other physical event (Charlow, 2008). Finally, in order to maintain our causal agency, Chisholm's argument requires that our decisions are made independently of our beliefs and desires. This seems counterintuitive and suggests that our free choices are made randomly (Charlow, 2008). Thus, Chisholm's argument may prove unsatisfactory to many philosophical and scientific scholars.

In contrast to Chisholm, Ayer argues that free will and determinism are compatible when the correct definition of freedom is employed. Rather than contrasting freedom with causality, Ayer believes that an action is free provided that it is unconstrained. An agent (A) is said to be unconstrained when neither of the following conditions hold: 1) a second agent (B) compels A to perform an action (X) by creating a situation in which the consequences of choosing an alternative to X are such that no reasonable person would be expected to disobey B; 2) A is deprived of the power of choice (Ayer, 417). Ayer argues that causes do not inherently constrain, from which it follows that actions may be simultaneously caused and freely performed (Ayer, 418). If freedom is contrasted with constraint, and Ayer's definition of constraint is utilized, then free will and determinism are in fact compatible.

A hard determinist may object to Ayer's premise that causes do not inherently constrain. Consider a petty thief stealing candy bars from a convenience store. According to Ayer, the thief is a free agent because he chose to steal free of external compulsion. The determinist, however, maintains that, in deciding whether or not to steal, the past conditions of the world and the laws of nature were such that the thief could not have done anything other than steal in the situation at hand. If this is true, then it seems that the thief was deprived of the power of choice, meaning that he was constrained as per Ayer's definition of constraint, and thus not acting freely. Here, Ayer would respond that the determinist has misunderstood the nature of causality, which is in actuality a concomitance between two classes of events that does not entail any compulsion or constraint (Ayer, 418). In this case, the weight of the incompatibilist objection depends on which definitions of freedom and causality are taken to be true.

If the plausibility of an argument is evaluated by the number and severity of objections it raises, then Ayer's argument must be considered more convincing than Chisholm's. Chisholm's argument contradicts empirical evidence and requires a serious revision of the concepts of freedom and the causal closure of the physical. The main objection to Ayer's argument, on the other hand, concerns the accuracy of his definitions of freedom, constraint, and causality, which are at worst very close to our experience of the concepts they represent. Thus, Ayer's argument is more plausible than Chisholm's.

However, the problem of compatibility can be avoided entirely if an argument is made based on the pragmatic conception of belief. Compatibilists and incompatibilists alike rely on an epistemic conception of belief, which concerns the truth of our beliefs regarding free will and determinism, as well as their justification in light of the known facts. The pragmatic conception of belief, on the other hand, maintains that an agent holds a belief if and only if he is inclined to act in accordance with his belief. There is no doubt that people behave as though they were free and morally responsible for their actions, and that people would behave differently if they believed otherwise. Thus, people should be treated as if they were free and morally responsible, regardless of the truth and compatibility of determinism and free will.

Of course, there are serious objections to this argument as well. It has often been the case that people have behaved in deplorable ways due to false beliefs that were widely accepted at the time. In the United States, for instance, whites justified the practice of slavery on the false belief that blacks were inferior to whites. The epistemic conception of belief would not allow the practice of slavery, as it requires the rejection of false beliefs. Thus, arguing for a particular belief based on the pragmatic conception of belief may lead to dangerous consequences. While the issue of compatibility can be swept under the carpet by employing pragmatic principles, it is a question that deserves epistemic exploration. Fortunately, the best arguments support the compatibility of free will and determinism, which allow the current systems of moral responsibility and scientific inquiry to remain intact.",56.23,73.5,56.18,43.33,10150
Philosophy,Report,Undergraduate,Hume and Smith on Justice,"Adam Smith and David Hume agree that rules of justice are necessary for a society to form and thrive. Their approaches to justice differ, however. The key difference is Hume proposes an artificial, observer based theory based upon a convention, while Smith proposes an impartial projectionist theory based upon warranted resentment.

Examination of Hume's Justice Theory
David Hume's theory regarding evaluation of actions proposes that actions are judged on motivation, not performance - When we praise any actions, we regard only the motives that produc'd them, and consider the actions as signs or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external performance has no merit. If it is the case that motivation is the underlying factor in judging an action, all virtuous actions derive their merit only from virtuous motives, and are consider'd merely as signs of these motives. As stated previously, a virtuous action must be motivated by a virtuous motive. Likewise, a non-virtuous action must be motivated by a non-virtuous motive. Note the difference between motivation and outcome. A man cannot commit a virtuous action and receive merit if he is motivated by a non-virtuous intention. It is not the outcome, it is the motive behind the action- A virtuous motive is requisite to render an action virtuous.

At this point Hume begins to question the motivation for justice. What is the motivation behind rules of justice in a society? Self-love…is the source of all injustice and violence. In order to form a society, self-love must be tempered for public interest, i.e. public benevolence. However, three roadblocks, according to Hume, exist which prevents a natural affinity of justice for public interest. First, the rules of justice are not natural and only arise after an artificial convention establishing the rules of justice. Second, the public, as a whole, will be unaware of many infractions against the rules of justice that might occur in private or between two persons. For example, Hume cites a secret loan between two men. Nobody but those two will be aware of the conditions or status of the loan. Third, public interest is too abstract and distant for men to consider it in their daily business and decision making processes.

Private benevolence, or a regard to the interests of the party concern'd, cannot be the motivation for justice either. Hume contradicts private benevolence as a motive with examples. What if a man has given me just cause to hate him or what if the guy is an overall jerk, who deserves the hatred of society? In all these cases, the original motive to justice wou'd fail; and consequently the justice itself, and along with it all property, right and obligation…Private benevolence, therefore, is not the original motive of justice.

If private benevolence and public benevolence are not reasons for justice than the sense of justice and injustice is not deriv'd from nature, but arises artificially, tho' necessarily from education, and human conventions. Justice, according to Hume, is not a part of our nature, but rather derives from artificial conventions. Contradicting Hobbes, the rules of justice are not arbitrary, however.

Why is justice necessary? Rules of justice are required for man to build a society, to be on par with other creatures. Society compensates man for what he lacks. A human being lacks many of the advantages of other animals. For example, humans do not have long hair or fur to keep warm. We lack claws and teeth necessary to catch and kill prey. Compared to other animals, we are naked and defenseless. Society is the great equalizer. When every individual person labours apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work…Society provides a remedy…'Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous. Society forms a larger group of humans, increasing our force while allowing for economic specialization, which increases ability and output. Finally, through a larger group, with a collective spirit, the group is stronger and less expos'd to fortune and accidents.

The advantages of society appear obvious. Why is it then not natural to form a society? According to Hume, there are other particulars in our natural temper, and in our outward circumstances, which are very incommodious and are even contrary to the requisite conjunction. Among the former, we may justly esteem selfishness to be the most considerable. Formation of a society requires give and take. An individual must relinquish some power to the state. A man might question- Why should I relinquish my freedom? I am perfectly able to take care of myself and family without the help of others.

Hume provides a counter. Man possesses three types of goods- Mind, body, and possessions. Our mind is secure from others. Nobody can steal it from you. Your body cannot be taken but it can be damaged. For example, someone can cut off your hand but it is of no use to that other person. Finally, possessions can be transferred without losing any value and likewise, possessions can be taken by another. The scarcity of possessions makes them valuable, as there is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one's desires and necessities. The ownership of more goods is desired in society. As the improvement, therefore, of these goods is the chief advantage of society, so the instability of their possession, along with their scarcity, is the chief impediments. Not everyone can possess equal amounts of goods though. There is only so much gold in the world. Why work hard for goods if you cannot guarantee their safety and you could just steal them from a neighbor? A safeguard is needed to ensure safety of your possessions.

Hume proposes society as the answer to securing goods. The very advantage of possessions is its downfall. Because possessions are so easily transferred, a remedy is required to safeguard them from theft. By putting these goods, as far as possible, on the same footing with the fix'd and constant advantages of the mind and body. This can be done after no other manner, than by a convention enter'd into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry. Creating rules of justice makes possessions equivalent with a person's mind and body. Just as your mind and body cannot be taken and used by another, so too should your possessions have the same protection.

A society, by entering into a convention of rules, stabilizes possession of goods amongst a society. The convention is a general sense of common interest; which sense all the members of the society express to one another, and which induces them to regulate their conduct by certain rules. Mutual respect is created. I will not take my neighbors possessions and in turn, he will not take my possessions. The convention creates mutual benefits too. Hume compares it thus, Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other. The two men in the boat recognize the necessity to cooperate in rowing or suffer for lack of cooperation. Neither will be advantaged if he rows less than the other. It is only through cooperation that the two can advance.

Conventions do not arise suddenly and triumphantly. Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possessions the less deriv'd from human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. Conventions arise from repeated cooperation, similar to a prisoner's dilemma game. As society starts, mutual trust is limited because of limited interaction and cooperation. As interaction and trust increases, people see the value of repeated games of prisoner's dilemma. A man will be more likely to cheat if he knows he will not have to play the game again because there will be no opportunity for revenge. However, if the man knows he must play the game repeatedly, he will be less likely to cheat because the other man will have the chance for revenge. Perpetual cheating and punishments creates suboptimal outcomes. A convention of justice arises in like manner because we learn the advantages of fair play, trust, and the punishment for breaking the trust of others. Hume further clarifies a convention by comparing it to the adoption of a language. A group of people did not formally establish a language. Instead group interactions formed a language over time.

Hume asserts as certain, That 'tis only from the selfishness and confin'd generosity of man, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origins. Hume contends that justice is an artificial virtue that can only exist because of men's self-love. It requires man to realize that he can improve his position by establishing a society. He presents a multi-point argument to defend his claim.

First, as proved before, our motive for justice does not come from a regard to benevolence or public interest. If man were naturally born with these sentiments, no rules of justice would be necessary.

Second, justice is not founded on reason. Hume does relent that the sense of virtue is deriv'd from reason. Justice is founded on our impressions. It was out of a concern for our own and the public interest that the laws of justice were established.

Third, Hume argues that those impressions, which give rise to this sense of justice, are not natural to the mind of man, but arise from artifice and human conventions. Hume provides further explanation. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to public interest; and were it to stand alone, without being follow'd by other acts, may, in itself, be very prejudicial to society. An individual man has no purpose for justice nor does a single rule of justice prove effective. Collective rules of justice and a collective society prove necessary for justice to be effective. Without justice, society must immediately dissolve, and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppose'd in society…yet the whole system of actions, concurr'd in by the whole society, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part. Man must set-aside feelings of self-love in order to form society. He recognizes his life will be improved by abdicating some selfishness in order to achieve a greater outcome.

The moral obligations to justice have yet to be answered. Hume asks, Why we annex the idea of virtue to justice, and of vice to injustice? According to Hume, moral sentiment is the sentiment of right and wrong. He defines vice as every thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions and virtue as whatever produces satisfaction. Sympathy with the public interest is the source of moral approbation. Hume presents feelings of moral approbation for following justice as a tool by politicians to strengthen society. As public praise and blame encrease our esteem for justice; so private education and instruction contribute to the same effect. Society needs people to buy-into the system and establish rules of justice as norms of action. Reputation is used as a further tool to increase societal pressure to follow rules of justice. “There is nothing, which touches us more nearly than our reputation, and nothing on which our reputation more depends than our conduct, with relation to the property of others. Societal considerations of a man's reputation weigh heavily on his daily life and success. It brings a clear effect of the rules of justice to a man's everyday life. Justice is not abstract rules.

Examination of Smith's Justice Theory
Adam Smith defines justice as a virtue. However, distinctions are drawn between justice and other virtues. Unlike other virtues, observation of justice is not up to us and may be extorted by force. The most important distinction occurs if rules of justice are violated. Violation of justice draws resentment because it causes a disapproved injury to another and is deserving of punishment.

What separates a virtue, such as benevolence, from justice? If violating justice is worthy of resentment and punishment, should a non-benevolent person also be the object of resentment? Smith disagrees and draws a distinction between hatred and resentment. Hatred is not on par with resentment. When discussing benevolence, an expression of hatred should be reserved for someone who does not injure someone, but rather disappoints by not being as benevolent as the average. A man who is not benevolent or less so than an average man, is the proper recipient of hatred. His lack of benevolence towards others, while selfish, does not directly injure a specific person.

Consider now the purpose of resentment- Resentment seems to have been given us by nature for defense, and for defense only. Resentment is a proper sentiment to feel while attacked. How dare this person attack me and intend to hurt me? He is disrespecting my space and body. Resentment aims to fix the feeling of disrespect brought about by another's actions. Recognizing someone else as responsible is an important part of gaining your respect back. Reputation building is an additional result. Others, through fear of the like punishment, may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence.

If the virtue of justice must be observed, should not virtues, like benevolence, be enforceable by others? Justice involves a violation of rights and laws, not just falling short of another's ideals. Other virtues are measured differently- That seems blamable which falls short of that ordinary degree of proper beneficence which experience teaches us to expect of every body; and on the contrary, that seems praise-worthy which goes beyond it. The ordinary degree itself seems neither blamable nor praise-worthy. In other words, we expect a certain degree of charity, for example, from someone. When a butcher donates money to charity, we make a judgment that his contribution was appropriate, considering his income. This is an ordinary amount, expected of men. However, if the butcher did not donate any money, we would find him blamable for not meeting our definition of ordinary. Likewise, if the butcher donated an incredible amount of money, going above-and-beyond what is ordinary, we would find it praise-worthy. Should a person, who, compared to the ordinary, is not charitable, be forced to be more so? Smith argues no; the spectator can intermeddle no other way than by advice and persuasion. Upon all such occasions, for equals to use force against one another, would be thought the highest degree of insolence and presumption. Using force to make an equal do as you wish is an injury to their independence and rights.

A paradox exists between justice and other virtues. As explained previously, we would praise someone whose actions are above-and-beyond. However, observing the rules of justice cannot be morally praise worthy. It is only violators of justice who are condemned. In fact, we may often fulfill all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing. Merely not violating the rules does not deserve praise. One cannot observe the rules of justice better than another- I cannot not murder someone more than my neighbor. I either break a rule of justice or I follow the rules of justice.

A man does have a reasonable expectation if he follows the rules of justice. As every man doth, so shall it be done to him… This is the classic Golden Rule- Do unto others as they would do unto you. If a man follows the rules of justice, no more, he should expect similar treatment from others. By following the rules of justice, he should not injure any others. Therefore, no one should feel resentment towards him.

Smith has established a principle of justice regarding private individuals' actions towards each other. His focus shifts towards framing justice as necessary for the creation of a working society. Smith creates an argument that we are all intertwined with one another. Smith recognizes, Every man is, no doubt, by nature, first and principally recommended to his own care; and as he is fitter to take care of himself than of any other person, it is fit and right that it should be so. A person knows themselves better than another; therefore, he should know better his own needs and how to achieve them. However, to satisfy those needs, a man cannot interfere with the rights of another. Acknowledging that we care more about our immediate needs than another's, Smith argues though the ruin of our neighbor may affect us much less than a very small misfortune of our own, we must not ruin him to prevent that small misfortune, nor even to prevent our own ruin. Even if the pains of a neighbor do not affect us as much as him, this does not give us the right to cause pains to him in order to satisfy our needs, even if our needs will destroy us. For example, say I owed money on my mortgage. I need money fast but this does not give me the right to steal from my neighbor. This action is disrespectful and injurious to the neighbor. He would have every right to feel resentment towards me, as I injured him.

As the greater and more irreparable the evil that is done, the resentment of the sufferer runs naturally the higher; so does likewise the sympathetic indignation of the spectator, as well as the sense of guilt in the agent. Smith recognizes an obvious difference in the injuries done to man. He recognizes death as the worst evil- Murder, therefore, is the most atrocious of all crimes which affect individuals only. Following his chain, theft and robbery are the greater crimes than breach of contract. Smith recognizes that, to be deprived of that which we are possessed of, is a greater evil than to be disappointed of what we have only the expectation. The worst crimes, which require the most sacred laws of justice, are crimes against life and person.

Smith presents society as a necessity and protection from crimes. It is thus that man, who can subsist only in society, was fitted by nature to that situation for which he was made. All the members of human society stand in need of each others assistance, and are likewise exposed to mutual injuries. Society is possible because of justice and Smith's previous conception of the Golden Rule. Society, however, cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another. If a man does not feel that their neighbor will respect them for following the rules of justice, he has no incentive to follow the rules of justice himself. Why should he be a sucker and respect others only to be taken advantage of by those who he respects? In a society, an understanding must exist between members that mutual respect will prevail.

If mutual respect makes a society, then should a society based not upon justice but rather benevolence be as successful? Smith counters that, Beneficence, therefore, is less essential to the existence of a society than justice. Society may subsist…without beneficence; but the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it. Imagine a ship of pirates. It is their mission to rob, rape, pillage and steal; obviously, not benevolent intentions. However, a society must develop on board their ship to be successful. Even among a group of scoundrels, order must exist. This society is not based upon beneficence, but rather a concept of justice. Even among law breakers, rules of justice must be created. For example, among pirates, rules must be created to respect the captain and how to split the booty. Without simple rules such as these, the ship will be chaos and no plundering will be done, not an ideal outcome for any pirate on the ship.

Smith provides a selfish reason for man to buy-in to society. He is sensible too that his own interest is connected with the prosperity of society, and that the happiness, perhaps the preservation of his existence, depends upon its preservation. In an organized society, a man's life will be easier and more prosperous. Living among a society provides economic incentives and greater protection. He has vested interest in the success of the society- Every appearance of injustice, therefore, alarms him. Who wants to live in a society with an ineffective police force, allowing murder, theft, and assaults? A man's safety is threatened along with his economic interests.

Punishment for crime is not motivated for preservation of society, but rather for a desire to punish the wrong that occurred. So when a single man is injured, or destroyed, we demand the punishment of the wrong that has been done to him, not so much from a concern for the general interest of society, as from a concern for that very individual who has been injured. Again, this is a reiteration of the belief that resentment is not about revenge, but rather regaining respect.

Comparison of Hume and Smith
The major difference between Hume and Smith lies in the perspective in which the rules of justice are considered. Hume believes justice is based on a mutually advantageous convention between men, taking into account and providing for man's limited generosity and the scarcity of possessions. Hume believes that the convention works through a man's inherent self-love. He believes a man to be able to step-back and realize that the convention works to his advantage, even if he must restrain his selfish desires. Referring back to the oar boat example, two men in the boat working together are able to go further in less time and effort than one man alone. Each man has incentive to cooperate, knowing that the other has equal incentive to cooperate. Smith's disposes of the idea of a convention. His theory of justice is based upon impartially projecting ourselves into another agent's perspective and viewing the problem from their situation. If that person's actions match what we feel or would do in the same situation, as an impartial projection, then we find the person to have acted properly. So what makes an act unjust when we project ourselves? Injustice is linked to feelings of resentment. Resentment is felt when we are injured. It affixes blame and culpability onto someone else; however, it is not a desire for revenge. Nor is it a desire to inflict injury upon the other. Resentment seeks to gain back respect. So projecting ourselves into the perspective of another, we must ask whether that person ought to feel resentment towards another and whether they can resist or demand punishment or compensation.

Accountability then, is a central theme of Smith's theory of justice. A person ought to be accountable for their actions and recognize the right of another to feel resentment towards them for causing injury. There ought to be recognition that a reaction from another is caused by a lack of respect for them. Hume recognizes the need for accountability as well. A moral obligation to follow justice is necessary. Hume hinges his argument upon following the rules of justice as a virtuous pursuit. The moral obligation to follow the rules of justice is a function of a moral sentiment of what is right. Establishing social costs to not following the rules of justice, such as damage to a violator's reputation, makes rules of justice as a social norm.

Hume and Smith have similar thoughts about whether an action is virtuous. Their general theory is that an action is virtuous if it proceeds from a virtuous motive. The action's result cannot be judged as blamable. According to Smith, He who shoots a bird, and he who shoots a man, both of them perform the same external movement; each of them draws the trigger of a gun. The consequences…are…still more indifferent either to praise or blame, than even the external movement of the body. As they depend, not upon the agent, but upon fortune. The only consequences for which he can be answerable, or…deserve either approbation or disapprobation…are those which were someway or other intended. The virtuous intentions of the man must be judged for the actions of him shooting the gun are identical, whether he intends to kill man or bird. It is his intention that matters. Smith's theory is echoed by Hume- When we praise any actions, we regard only the motives that produc'd them, and consider the actions as signs or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external performance has no merit.

The theories of Smith and Hume emphasize the importance of justice to society. Smith best describes the importance of justice to society thus- Justice, on the contrary, is the main pillar that upholds the whole edifice. If it is removed, the great, the immense fabric of human society, that fabric which to raise and support seems in this world, if I may say so, to have been the peculiar and darling care of Nature, must in a moment crumble into atoms.",0,8.59,2.62,2.56,25055
Philosophy,Response Paper,Undergraduate,The Evaluative Role of Pain,"Eric suggested in class that pain fulfills criterion E, the evaluative role that mental objects seem to have. Pain is not bad because we assign it the value bad. It just is bad (intrinsically bad, I would assume).

However, it seems-at least in some cases-that pain is bad because of the value we assign to it. Consider the case of the devout Christian. The devout Christian views physical pain as a way to share in the suffering of Christ (indeed, Pope John Paul II spoke of his great physical suffering as a blessing). He considers his pain a good thing, because it allows him to meditate on the sufferings of Christ and therefore become a better Christian. Pain is not bad for the devout Christian. Use another example, if you like. For the hedonistic masochist, too, pain is not bad. It is a source of pleasure for him, and he does not consider what gives him pleasure to be bad.

Now, does this mean that those of us who consider pain to be intrinsically bad are really just assigning the value bad to pain? I do not know, and a one page paper hardly seems the place to discuss the question. If pain is not bad by assignment, then it fulfills the evaluative role. If pain is bad merely by assignment, though, it does not fulfill the evaluative role. This does not mean, of course, that pain does not have a place among the mental. Pain appears to play a behavioral role, it is introspectible from the inside , and it is either not located in space, or indeterminately located in space.",0,33.87,33.87,33.87,1490
