The Vicar of Wakefield as a Failed Morality Story Morality stories and plays that espouse Christian values have been," around for thousands of years. In fact, they had their origins in religious beliefs that were first thought up by people living in prehistoric times. Many of these stories are still told today, though the majority have not been written down. The religious ideas behind morality stories date back to ancient Egypt and were later used during the Middle Ages. Stories like “The Wise Men” from Ancient Greece are quite well known. This play was adapted into the novel The Light Between Oceans by Ernest Hemingway in 1946. Other stories include those from The Bible, such as the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as those based on the life of Adam and Eve. One of the most famous characters who can be traced back nearly 2000 years is the biblical character Joseph in Genesis. Joseph’s name comes from Joseph the legendary king of Egypt. He is also known as Jovah.

A lot of people have heard of Joseph because he is a historical figure. However, Joseph was not the only biblical figure who was known to history. There were many others who were either fictional or had no real existence. For example, in Roman times a myth was made up about a man named Doryphorus. Although the name Joseph is probably derived from this mythological name, he was actually never a real person. Instead, his name refers to the Biblical name for his tribe. DORPHORUS (Joseph) is sometimes considered the Hebrew word for ‘people‘. Throughout his entire life, it was Joseph who represented humanity to himself and to others. Not only did Joseph show the way to be a God-fearing man, but he also exemplified the ways of a good shepherd. It is important to note that Joseph did not live at any time during his lifetime. Therefore, when he passed on to his disciples, there was no way they would have known his identity. His disciples did know his origin, however. So, how do we know the truth? The answer is that through archaeology. Archaeology is one of several methods used to investigate the past. Ancient civilizations left behind monuments which represent their achievements. These monuments are what are known today as artifacts. Due to their antiquity, these artifacts are extremely useful in determining the history of an ancient civilization. Through these ancient artifacts, archaeological theories can gain a high degree of accuracy and reveal more about an individual‟s past than any other method. Additionally, because they are able to tell the actual truth about events, archaeologists are often called upon to solve crimes and solve mysteries. Some of their most notable efforts have involved solving crimes related to murder, for example. They are also often employed in finding hidden treasure, especially in Egypt, Greece, Turkey, France, the British Isles, and Russia. Finally, although archaeologist are not usually allowed to speak with the dead, many have studied cremation rituals and burial sites. By examining these rituals, archaeologists are then able identify places where people were buried and discovered secret chambers. Any one who knows anything about history is aware of just how important archaeologic discoveries can become. Please note: This website is NOT affiliated with any archaeological or archaeological investigation. Every archaeological excavation is different, therefore, each site will have its own history and its particular significance.

"Governmental Funding for the Development of Self-Sustaining Communities: The Stabilization of the HIV/AIDS Crisis At the end of 2006, over 39.5 million people were"," living with the disease worldwide. More than 90 percent of these patients are from developing countries and are the majority of patients in Africa and Southeast Asia. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that about 4.2 million HIV-positive patients still need health services and that it is estimated that more than 2.0 million of them have not accessed primary care services.

The global impact of HIV epidemic has been compounded by widespread drug resistance to anti-HIV therapy and poor access to treatment. In 2005, nearly one million new infections occurred every month. This represents more deaths than all tropical diseases combined! Although the UNAids estimates suggest an absolute number of 15 million deaths due to this epidemic, the death toll could reach as high as 25 million if drugs were only available in sub-Saharan Africa. Between January 2002 and January 2006 two new drugs, zidovudine (AZT) and stavudines (d4T), were approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of people living in regions where resistance against these drugs was already present. These drugs have improved the prognosis of some HIV patients and significantly reduced the mortality rates among those treated. Nevertheless, significant progress has yet to be made in terms of scaling up access, reducing drug-resistant cases, and increasing the quality of life of millions of persons living through this crisis. However, since 2002, several attempts have been made to assess the status of implementation and scaling-up of policies in several countries. A number studies have described the existence of a ""reproductive health"" system in some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Rwanda, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Kenya, Mozambique, Ghana, Senegal, Gambia and Mauritius. Several countries have implemented a National AIDS/Hepatitis Control Programme (NAHCP) in which there is active coordination between the government, non-governmental organizations and international partners. Other countries continue to struggle with efforts to overcome structural problems in HIV prevention and treatment programs. Many countries are still confronted with difficulties related to limited resources, poor infrastructure, inadequate finance, limited human resources and a shortage of medical professionals. Although few countries achieve the ambitious targets for universal access set by UNIDSR, a vast number do not take advantage of opportunities for scale-ups. WHO, UNITAID, ECHO, OCHA, African Union and United States of America (USA) support many projects to improve the provision of services at a regional level. Additionally, many countries make commitments to increase their funding or provide incentives for individuals and institutions to support the development of self-sustained communities. Finally, various initiatives, both national and foreign, have tried to leverage the potential of long-term, selfsufficient rural economies to accelerate the process of transforming HIV into a health crisis in developing country settings. One such example is the Community Based Treatment of Essential Drugs (CBTCED) initiative, which was launched in Ethiopia, Niger, Togo, Liberia, Mauritania, Madagascar, Chad, Guinea Bissau, Central African Republic, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire in 2005. It involved training thousands of community workers and managers to work in a decentralized manner under the guidance of NGOs and health care providers in order to train health facilities in providing essential medicines and to reintegrate the population into communities facing a severe public health challenge. CBTCIED is a project which uses three complementary approaches: decentralization, decentralizing the program, focusing on community participation. Through these approaches CBTIED aims to provide the best possible care to those who need it. Due to the nature of its strategy, CBTICED is different from other similar projects. Unlike other projects, it does not try to combine strategies. Rather, instead of linking people together in groups, activities are designed to help the most vulnerable people to access the healthcare services they need. Therefore, although CBCIED has developed a set of integrated interventions, each of which addresses a specific situation, its aim is not to simply distribute medicines, but rather to prevent, diagnose, treat and care for those whose health is threatened by HIV infection. As a consequence, when CBTAICD was started, no explicit target of reaching 10 million patients was set. Instead, donors and partners set a target to reach 0.25 million PLHVs in three years. Under this scenario, 3.6 million individuals would be reached. Subsequently, donor funding for CBAIED was revised and increased to 2 million USD/year. Since then, additional financing has begun to flow to CBNIED, with a view to addressing the remaining 0·8 million needs. Despite these efforts, however, because of an"
Who Is God? One common problem for the Christian tradition is the idea," that God is one. The basic problem is that we think of God as a being that _has_ to be understood, an ontological being, not as having a physical existence. This does not follow from a literal reading of scripture. In fact, it can be traced to certain formulations in the earliest writings of Christianity. God has always been thought of as essentially the same thing, and this is something we see in medieval writers. But Jesus made a direct distinction between God's essence and His existence, saying, ""But He has given us this commandment, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with thy whole mind.""

God's nature is thus twofold, because God (as an individual) is two-in-one: He is wholly the Father, who is fully the Son, fully The Holy Spirit, whose being is completely that of a divine individual, distinct from both body and soul. Therefore he is not only _physical_, but also _mental_.

 **The Nature of Being**

   **1** The first thing to point out is simply that every being possesses the essence of being. Any other definition is a dead end; nothing else makes sense here. Every being has the kind of essence that I have described. When the Greeks were talking about what they believed to belong to being—what they called _logos_ —they were using a somewhat vague term, equivalent to ""essence."" Later they came to understand what it meant. (See below.) But even these definitions are too abstract and ambiguous to satisfy our need for a straightforward, precise and absolute definition. So let me set up my concept of essences.

"The Absolute Necessity of College-Level Writing Courses Reading Mike Rose's article, The Language of Exclusion: Writing Instruction"," and Race in America (New York: Routledge, 2013), in which he argues that schools are being racially segregated due to a shortage of college-level writing courses for black and Asian students, the following excerpt, from Rose’s article reflects what I have observed about Asian American students at my school:

“In the early 1970s, when I was 10 years old, my parents moved into what was then the black part of Kansas City. Our new neighborhood had no college or high school, just a few places where you could get something out of a vending machine. It didn‘t matter how much money you made, you were still likely to end up in the same social stratum as the kids who lived around us.
For example, if you worked in an accounting job, your family” — he pointed his index finger at me — “lived near a black family. This was very hard on us, because our father wanted us to be smart and work hard to get good grades. In order for him to accomplish that, we had to write essays about anything we wanted to study. We were expected to produce one essay each week.‚ By the time we finished our senior year, I knew everything there was to know about accounting. I took care of myself by writing papers on my lunch breaks. My grades came easily. But my friends weren‟t so lucky. They had bad teachers, were poor, or both, and lost out on every scholarship available to the rich kids. Many of their parents didn't like them, either. For example..."" He pointed a finger toward the left side of the room. „By the end of high they couldn‌t read a book without having to refer to someone in a voice higher than theirs. So they went to school with a lot of other people. Their families would throw them out, especially those whose parents had money and education. If you think this is bad, let me tell you what it′s really like to live in Kansas. You see lots of black people here, but you hardly see any white people.""
But some Asian Americans do attend college, though not at a prestigious institution like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Northwestern, etc. The first two colleges that I attended were well known to me, having been involved in several cultural protests, such as protesting Vietnam War and bringing about Civil Rights movement in US. Both colleges are located in relatively conservative parts of DC, so although Asians make up 20% of student body at these colleges, Asians constitute 30% at most of admissions. Other colleges in Washington, D.C., are known more to many Asians, since they are less conservative and can attract Asian applicants. Still, few Asians attend these prestigious colleges. Why?
My observation is that many Asian children grow up thinking, ‬ ""If I go to university, maybe I can become an engineer or a doctor or lawyer. That way I will receive a nice salary and respect from my family and friends.""   This is the mentality that has caused most Asian parents to send their kids to these elite colleges for their future aspirations. Although the majority of Asians attending these top colleges would not need to work in order to earn a living, many are still driven by these ambitions. As Rose notes, Asian kids often don‰™t focus on academics as a career, instead they gravitate toward their studies in exchange for affection and support from their family members. Therefore, taking advantage of these programs might be a good way for Asian youth to connect with their past and future generations. Additionally, these degrees may provide them with the opportunity to meet with potential employers in their fields of choice. Consequently, reading books like ‹ Rose offers to help Asian youths enter the jobs market is a waste of time. However, it does not mean that Asian adults should sit idle; they should use these courses as resources to encourage their children and youth and to keep them away from racism. ‱
Rose writes that ‡""Over half of Asian-Americans who graduate from college do so with only a high-school degree, mainly due its low cost and ease of entry. More than 80 percent of blacks who earned a bachelor $ate degree between 1980 and 2000 obtained it through community colleges or junior colleges --the same percentage that prepared almost half (47%) of all college students last year.""‡¶
(1) I believe that it is obvious that most Asians who want to go into STEM fields, for example electrical engineering, are going to need more than a GED to succeed. Just because they got a diploma doesn ​t mean they‴re ready for the workforce. Even if they had the desire to become engineers, they would probably need additional training. STEM"

A (Solitary) Place For Fantasy in Reality Reality is composed of a rather tenuous fabric in the," sky, with a vast array of people around it. The place itself is not really reality, because it’s only a “place” for one type of fantasy; the one to be played out in that place is one realm. Therefore, when we see a reality based on fantasy, we are seeing a little of reality within the realm of that fantasy. But this is the only place where you can make your fantasy real. In other words, fantasy is always situated within reality. This is why the so-called fantasy world of video games does not exist as a physical world. It is a fiction within a fictive reality called reality (Masters of Illusion: A History of Video Games).

Video Games are fantasy worlds that are made up of several different levels of realism. They are the equivalent of an imaginary world that only exists within some story. A story is something written down or remembered by another person. Stories are fictional documents that describe a specific time and place.
Some stories are written in a linear fashion. Every day is like every other day. These are called action stories. Many of these stories end in happy endings, but the characters lose their lives or are defeated by other enemies. Other stories do not end happily, nor do they include happy ending. All stories include some degree of tragedy, although it may not be as dramatic as the happy events. Movies are most frequently considered as action films. Action is usually centered around one battle, or a series of battles. Realism is important to many movies, since they are trying to tell the same story again and again. However, realism is only one part of the story, and sometimes it is just necessary to make things realistic. Sometimes, a writer needs to write in such a way that it makes things more difficult than they need to already be. Although the goal is to move away from realism, often realism causes problems for the plot. For example, in one movie, Jack Reacher is trying desperately to save his daughter while fighting against evil terrorists. Jack is faced with various problems, such as having to watch the wrong part three times before finally getting to the part that he needs. He loses his nerve and starts to pull out his weapon. Fortunately, his wife tells him what to do. Finally, he sees the enemy coming at him, puts his pistol back in its holster, hands her the keys to his office, takes a breath, walks towards the fight, gives the orders, kills the terrorists, leaves the room, closes the door, turns around, sees his family and decides that this will be his last mission. Actually, the movie is much more complicated than this, as there are a lot of other events going on, including the death of his granddaughter. So, it becomes hard to understand what is happening at any given moment. Another problem is that, sometimes, even when the hero gets the key to rescue his loved ones, someone else steals it first and then keeps the deed to himself. Just think about what it would be if you were a terrorist looking for your daughter. You could take your gun and run away. Not knowing where she is, you could put it in your pocket and wait until she gets lost, kill her, take the car and leave. There are many instances where this would not make sense. Also, if Jack has to kill someone, chances are good that either he or another character is going to die. And that would explain the many deaths in movies that involve someone getting killed, especially in films that have very short running time. Most of us know the phrase ‘let‘s just go home“, which is actually a common phrase used in many movie plots. Whenever the two protagonists want to get away, they say „let's just find the girl and get home.‟ But, now that I think of it, let's not forget that Jack's wife was supposed to play a crucial role in this episode of Jack and the Beanstalk. She certainly didn't help him. Maybe she should have been killed along with the others. Oh well, maybe the writer wanted to test the limits of comedy. Anyway, I hope you liked this article, feel free to leave your feedback below.

A Tale of Two Cities(1): A story about an old woman, who is very rich, living in the French countryside. She lives alone with her daughter and son-in-law. Years ago, when she had no children of her own, she wanted to have a son and a daughter - a lot of people were against this, but she refused to accept any help from anyone. One day she meets an older man, a merchant, whose wife has just died. He understands what ailed her and decides that she mustn't be left alone any longer. That evening, as she sits smoking by herself, the two men start talking. They tell her that there is a great deal of trouble brewing in Paris. It seems that a war is imminent.
The next morning, Mrs. Daniels calls on her niece and nephew, little French girls, to tell them that they should prepare themselves for a trip to London. When the boys learn that their mother is dying, they decide to go ahead and travel to England. But before they leave, however, one of them has to write a letter to their father saying that he will meet them at London, since they know that it is the only place where they will be safe. After the letter is delivered, their aunt is overcome by grief and cannot speak or cry anymore. Although the eldest daughter is extremely young, her heart beats strangely and she also begins to tremble. As she listens to her aunt's grief, tears begin to flow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, something terrible happens. A man comes running into the room carrying a large wooden box. Every hair of his head is covered in blood and there are huge holes in his face. His eyes are as dark as the night. And yet, he still runs towards his mother. Just as he reaches the window, his shoes make a sharp crack and his legs fall out from under him. With a horrible cry, mother and all the other members of their family run towards the door to try and save him!
At that moment, an angel of mercy appears in front of Mrs....

"Historical Places, Violent Spaces: A discussion on violence, personhood, and space in Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts Virginia Woolf's last novel Between the Acts is, more than"," any other, an experimental work in its approach to writing about literature. The book is one of a large number of texts which Woolfs has published during her lifetime, each of which might be described as a ""parallel"" to another. Between 2 and 3 (1949) comprises a series of essays about art, literature, memory and mortality. In the collection of short essays that follows, she discusses the ways in which different authors have treated their lives, death, loss, suffering, sex, religion, nature and the sea, the way they have dealt with the death or destruction of their bodies. This paper will concentrate on two of these essays: Woolff's consideration of suicide in Between 10 (1945) and A House for Mr Bissell (1974), in order to demonstrate how the two essays are linked and to highlight Woolft's critical stance when she considers what it means to be alive. Wooling writes in both pieces that there is no afterlife for her, since she will continue to write about what she has done after she dies, until she stops writing. Consequently, Woolley admits that it is hard to understand the purpose of life. Although the essays in between the acts can be read as part of an attempt to reconcile the apparent conflict between Woolford's belief in life after death and Woolufs's view of the importance of writing, they also contain crucial elements of Woolfw's own philosophy of poetry. Both works reflect on what Woolwf describes as the fundamental problem of creativity, namely that we cannot know our own reality even if we try, because we are always influenced by the world around us. Neither work, however, can help with this problem, for Woolweir's concern is with literary creation. Writing about death is a form of psychic repression, not a way of coping with it. Therefore, though Wooldings' essays can provide an account of what life is like for herself, it does not offer us a view at all of reality, let alone a reliable view. It is therefore in her writing that Woolwer finds the most profound meaning, but it may be that only Woolfp who writes about her own experience of death will ever see a genuine view from her point of view; Woolwyll is simply too self-absorbed to see what is happening to her.2 What Woolfyll wrote about inbetween the act essays is indeed a commentary on her relationship with life itself, yet it has very little relevance for the reader. More relevant for readers is the fact that the essayist is Woolfls daughter, who often seems unable to come to terms with her mother's death.3 So while Woolywl could have written about the same issues, such as whether there was an afterlife or whether she would continue writing after her death, Wooltfl would have needed to refer to these topics elsewhere. As the daughter of Wollwulf, Julia, whose poems are the source for Between10, Lily is aware of her situation and attempts to deal with them in spite of herself.4 This essay gives Woolply a chance to explain her view on suicide, without having to go into the question of whether Woolpffs own view is correct. Lily Woollfs view upon suicide is that suicide should be considered as an act of rebellion against the will of another person. Self-mutilation, suicide or murder are acts which are performed in the face of circumstances that require the suppression of will. However, in Lily's views, there are two conflicting principles underlying suicide. Firstly, that every human being is intrinsically valuable, although she identifies herself with being human. She believes that, within her body, no one is more important than anyone else. Secondly, whilst Lily does acknowledge that her will can sometimes make her suffer, this is not the kind of suffering that justifies her suicide; Lily sees this suffering as due to the forces of nature, hence the reason for suicide rather than to some external circumstance.5 Woolplths suicide need not be a final act, nor is there anything wrong with making a living out of it; suicide can merely represent an expression of deep anger at what needs to happen to someone else and bring relief from the oppression which leads to mental anguish.6 Woollofts argument for this perspective is contained in three parts: firstly, to express her personal beliefs about suicide via the actions of Lily; secondly, when Lily behaves in such a manner as to cause suffering to others, so as not to prevent them harming themselves; and thirdly to show the absurdity of thinking that one can kill oneself unless one causes suffering.7 First, I argue that Lily´s actions in response to being bullied by her classmates and being forced to withdraw from school are representative of how everyone reacts to certain experiences.8 Woollff"
"Bloom & Martha: Are You Not Happy in Your Home? The reader, after trudging through the strange stream-of-consciousness and reference-heavy"," structure of Martha Stewart Living and then reading about her with the same mix of fascination, trepidation and disbelief as Martha, now feels like she's getting to know Martha—the woman, not the magazine. This is the kind of book that's designed to be read in secret. The very idea of an audience who can appreciate the message from a woman who is so secretive about everything else (except when she wants people to start buying her stuff), is one of the most powerful tools we've ever seen for keeping a secret secure.

But even when I read the book, I'd say I feel a little left out of it. In a sense, the secret is still a mystery. I'm not sure what I expected to find in the pages of a magazine, but instead of what Martha would do, this is what she will do. It's not quite what the readers of her magazine will get out, because there is much more to it than what's in here. But many readers won't have a clue what they're getting into. Many will never guess what it means to watch a writer come to life. They'll just look at it and think, ""I don't understand.""
Some of us will take the mystery seriously and ask ourselves, What does this mean? What is it trying to tell me? And what are the possible meanings? It seems that only Martha can answer that, so maybe the answer comes from Martha herself. She did write that it was about sex. Oh, yes, sex! She didn't call it ""sex,"" though, obviously. And that was another thing, too. Although I don' t want to give away any of that. There are things I can't talk about. Or maybe there are secrets that I should keep. Like the ones I keep about myself. Would it be a good idea to write a memoir about those secrets? That might be necessary, anyway. Some of these secrets are pretty big. So maybe it's okay to keep them all. Just to figure out what you're doing. [The reader] knows exactly where she is and why, and can go to her website and read about what went on and see what else she has to say. A long time ago, she wrote that she wanted to ""tell the truth"" in her books. Now she doesn't. Maybe she just wants to let us know what is actually happening. All I know is that there's something else going on here, something that hasn't been talked about, that nobody has said yet, which might make it sound different. Because it could also be completely new. Whatever it is, it sounds like a lot of fun, especially for someone like me, who writes about such a weird subject as sex and beauty and food and fashion. We need more fun in life!
And so the reader will return to Martha and discover that not only is there something here that makes her feel like Martha is sitting across the room from her, ready to talk, maybe even share with her some wisdom, no matter how crazy it may seem, although it might seem crazy to some of you, right now. Not that Martha really needs any advice from anyone. For all she knows, Martha has already figured out the answers to all your questions. Who's to blame? Why is this happening to me again? How is my life supposed to continue? Where are my friends?
She had a plan. If she were going to die, taking her plans withher, living in Paris, writing about the experience, speaking of suicide and forgiveness and the way she planned to end it, would that be enough to make up for her failure? Would death make anything better? No. Nothing would make her happier. Her friends would be sad and she would cry and say, Look at all I've done. Look how much work I put in! I hope they forgive me. Please let me know when it happens. Love, you have no idea. You don’t understand. Hate me and hate me alone. Everyone else is dead. Did you hear what happened to my cat? He's dying. Didn't I tell you? I took him to this place. He lives there now because he ran away from my house. Can you believe it? They brought him back. Yes, he lived there until he died. Someone stole him. My cat was just a baby. Every day he heard his mother say goodbye and run away. Do you know how cruel he was? When I first saw the police, holding my son, screaming and crying, begging them to take me back, pleading with them. Begging them, please take him away, take my husband back to New York, my child back home. Let my little boy go. Wanting to go back"
Women in Beowulf Equality is a highly regarded goal in today's society; laws," on gender equality have been passed in several countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. However, although the concept of gender inequality has become more prominent since the 1980s (including the introduction of a national gender policy), the majority of people remain ignorant about the topic, especially in larger cities. This is unfortunate, since awareness levels for gender inequalities are often higher in smaller cities than in large metropolitan areas. In order to raise awareness about gender discrimination, we conducted a survey among employees at an Australian grocery chain. Our results indicated that only about a quarter (23.6%) of respondents were aware of the phenomenon of inter-sexualisation, with this figure declining to around 16% among those who had worked at least 5 years in the chain and over 12% amongst those with more than 10 years' experience. The majority (63.2%) claimed that they had never experienced any form of sexual harassment or bullying. These findings indicate that further education must be enhanced regarding gender issues in Australia and that there is much work to be done to increase public awareness of these important issues.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are cultural differences in views regarding attitudes towards sexual diversity in different cultural contexts. More specifically, it examined whether attitudes are influenced by the sex of participants, their level of education, or their self-reported experience with sexual assault. Additionally, the influence of age, ethnic background, religion, marital status, education level, previous sexual relationships, mental health, perceived sexual orientation and use of contraceptives on attitudes were investigated. Based on literature on the effect of sex on sexual attitudes \[[@B1]-[@see12]\], the current study also included the independent variables of self reported experience of rape/assault, sexual attraction to opposite-sex individuals and sexual aversion to same-gender individuals. Gender equality is defined as the equality of women and men in terms of their roles in society and legal positions. Therefore, attitudes toward sexual equality can be understood as a formative factor of social acceptance and inclusion. Although the term'sexual equality' has been suggested in a range of contexts \[e.g. \< \>\>^([@bib1])^\] and is not explicitly used in this paper, our research questions apply to this broader sense of equality. For example, in accordance with the Equality Index \| \||\|^(^[http://www.equalityindex.org/EN/\>]{.ul}^)^, gender should be defined so as to include both women\'s and male's perspectives. Other terminology used is that of trans-equalities, which is used to refer to the non-binary gender identities of transgender people. It is proposed that all gender-related concepts and values should include rights and protections for all genders, irrespective of whether they are considered feminine or masculine. Due to these developments, this research presents a more complex picture of attitudes regarding sexual minorities and gender stereotypes than previously thought possible. Furthermore, because the specific context of sexuality and sexuality is one of some of its most deeply held beliefs and attitudes, such knowledge might help to open up debates about what it means to value sexual expression and respect sexual differences more generally. Finally, studies have shown that gender ideology may foster gender inequity \>(\<^a^)\<(\<\>)^b^ where gender ideologies serve as an obstacle to making positive decisions about sex roles and marriage.^c^ This paper will explore the ways in which gender expectations and stereotypes have influenced the way in groups perceive sexual and cross-cultural differences and similarities between women (and men) and how this influences their attitudes and views about sexual behavior and relationships. We anticipate that the findings will contribute to a greater understanding of why people have attitudes that are contrary to their reality. Regarding sexual norms, for example: \""How would you rate the amount of time you spend each day thinking about and preparing for your partner\' s pleasure?\"" (women) \""Well, I could imagine that it\' ll take me quite a long time to prepare myself for her pleasure, though, my body would probably just start responding right away!\"" (*men*) Also, from a practical standpoint, ""\[the\]"" number of partners"" seems low, while ""\['the'\]'s no good!"" (*women*) There is indeed a lot of confusion about proper genital practices, as many women are not aware that \""they\"" don't like getting an ""U"" in front of certain parts of theirs. Consequently, when discussing sexual relations with others, people tend to express their discomfort with having someone else\' say something inappropriate to them. People"
The Love Covenant The book of Hosea presents a different view of God's," love to Israel. In the Bible, God loves his people as a God of love and mercy. The Bible teaches that God has a heart for his covenant people. This means that he is willing to forgive all kinds of sins so that they can go on living in God-honored ways. God forgives all sin because he loves us and wants us to be with him. He has an unconditional love for us that is greater than any sin we commit. Therefore, no one can have a relationship with God that does not come from a free, loving heart. Our God is the only God who loves me and my actions are the actions of his love. Everyone else will receive their reward according to their actions. (1 Cor. 13:4-6) If we make our choices freely, we will automatically receive the reward of being loved by God. Many people seem to think that if you have chosen to do something wrong, you cannot be forgiven of your sin. They say that Jesus did not die on the cross to save them, but to let them go free from their sins. But Jesus made the sacrifice necessary so they would be saved. Just as the Father sent Jesus to die for our sin, so we should be ready to live for Christ's sake so he can make us free. Jesus said, ""If you love Me, keep My commandments."" (John 14:15) We can never keep God’s commandments that way. If our lives are pleasing to him, then He will keep His commandments. That is why Jesus told Peter to tell the crowd, “You need not commandments; I have given you all things.” (19:24) As long as we seek after worldly things, such as material possessions, when we lose our salvation through sin or refusal to continue in the ways of Christ, it will be impossible for God to satisfy our righteous requirements. So if we desire to please God, He must love us enough to give us a spotless life before he will allow us into heaven. We must work hard to earn His love by our deeds rather than our words. Any person who seeks to lead a clean life will not become successful. Those who live a life pleasing unto God without giving themselves to the responsibilities of a righteous life, will never have the blessings of heaven on earth. Although the New Testament does clearly teach that our best efforts will surely bring us eternal life with the Lord, the Gospel also says that even if our efforts fail, our Lord will still meet us with His presence.

A Christian‟s greatest challenge is to find the truth of the gospel in all of its teachings about the kingdom of Heaven. Truth is not found in a textbook or a set of sermons. It comes from the heart of man and from his experience. When a man believes the message of Jesus, he changes. His heart grows with this new knowledge and becomes more conformed to Jesus‘s heart and example. Ultimately, those who truly understand the true Gospel of grace are able to move beyond self-seeking and pursue the life of obedience. Not all those whose hearts have been changed by Jesus are converted. Still, there are those born again Christians who find peace with Jesus in their hearts and who have experienced a transformation of their lives. Some of these are known as those „born-again“ Christians. These people are still caught in sin and still deny Jesus as their personal savior. Yet, now that their minds have truly been opened up to God and to what Jesus has done for them personally, they are no longer afraid of anything. Their faith in Jesus is so strong that every problem they encounter is overcome by their faith. Finally, these people have fully received Jesus into their heart as Savior and Lord and they know that all their past sins were forgiven because they had put Jesus under their own power. More than anything else, a person like these two women has realized that everything they once knew about themselves was wrong. Neither one of them has allowed her heart to grow up and become the kind of person she really wanted to become. Both ofthem have discovered that the source of joy in life is found outside of themselves and that it comes solely from Jesus. What they have learned is that great happiness begins when a mother‚s love is poured into her children. Love is defined as compassion, care, and respect. How wonderful that love can bring happiness to someone who knows nothing of this great blessing!"
An Artistic Composition of Hell Stephen's visualization of Hell is juxtaposed with its traditional description," by the Bible. This juxtaposition is brought together in such an interesting way that it is easily interpreted through its two different perspectives. The first perspective is the one that I have described above, in which the composition conveys a sense of a vast landscape filled with people, with the blue and red colors used in the painting to represent the various shades of red, brown, black and purple that come into play. In this perspective, Hell shows as a barren landscape where nothing exists. However, the second perspective comes from a different perspective in that God has created the earth and all its inhabitants so that they can live and enjoy their lives, even if there is little to no color in any of the landscapes. As a result, each individual person is painted with a full-color palette with varying shades and colors.

The next part of this scene is one where God gives each one of us a choice of how we should live our lives. He has divided the world into three areas, called Heaven, Earth and Hell, and given each person a set of rules that will guide them when they are living in each of these places. Although the image is simple, it makes for a very interesting visual representation of what each man or woman will experience when in Heaven. Notice that there are different colors and shades associated with each area, making it easy to understand why the first person chosen to be with God will be given a lot of freedom, since they will not be bound by any rules. They will do as they please throughout the whole of their life. When the third person decides to go to Hell for his or her sins, he or she will meet the same fate. Therefore, those who choose to stay in Hell will never be able to enjoy the life that Heaven offers. Those who end up in Earth will get the most out of life, because they would not need to worry about the outside world. Due to this, they could spend more time doing what they loved to do, being in charge of keeping their family and possessions, although it will take them some time to figure out that this is not the way they should behave. Ultimately, anyone who takes the wrong path will eventually be taken to the other side of reality, where they must accept the judgment of God and repent before it becomes too late. Finally, when we see Hell as barren, there really isn't any point in living there, for there simply won't be enough color to create a strong contrast between the grayness and the vibrant color that represents the light of Life.


A Visual Experience of Destruction Stephen’s picture of destruction (as well as the previous painting of creation) is also juxtaposing against the biblical description of its creation. Just as before, Stephen draws the two perspectives together, bringing them together to tell the story of Creation, showing how it was made, but at the bottom of his canvas, on top of an evergreen tree, is his own image of extinction. Here, instead of showing the sky, which would be a boring and flat background, you have a nice contrast that makes you think of something else. Not only that, though, does the contrast make you realize that the tree that was supposed to cover the Earth has actually left the surface of space. You see, once upon a time, God had to use trees to mark out the space that would hold everything, so he could create the universe we know today. Now, however, after the trees have left, something terrible has happened, as you can see in Stephen and his painting. God leaves the land that he has planted in all kinds of beautiful greenery and leaves it bare and dead. Instead of creating a peaceful environment, nature has gone into full attack mode, taking over what once was good for him. It seems that death has arrived to take all the good he gave to everyone, including him! The resulting chaos is something that we don't expect to see anymore. Many people have experienced the death of pets and family members, yet Stephen sees it as something different, someone whose eyes have opened up and who knows what is happening around them. Through this experience, we can all understand what it means to die and to let go of whatever we have been holding on to. Death, especially for someone like Stephen, who has spent his entire life looking up to God, has finally caught up with him and done something horrible to him; it has taken him away from the kind of peace and calm that only comes with knowing that you are going to eternal life with your Creator. We can truly understand this because we ourselves are the ones that have died, now having the opportunity to start over again with our Creator, wherever he leads us. At the end of Stephen Wampler‟s paintings, all of those people who have passed away are smiling and greeting one another with their new resurrected faces. Their faces"
The Role of Nicholas Levin in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina Though the appearances of Constantine Levin's brother Nicholas in Anna," are quite different, there is much in both novels that touches on aspects of the Russian poet's personality and work. In Anna, Nicholas seems to be both sympathetic and dismissive of his brother's literary success, something I have discussed more extensively in previous essays. His attitude towards the works of Tsar Boris Godunov and Tolgoff, especially in The Kreutzer Sonata and A Soldier from a Distance, is also quite similar.

But this is only the surface of things. Nicholas's attitude to Tolshy differs in several significant ways from that of Peter in Peter. For example, the two men know each other well enough to write each others' letters as a form of greeting or congratulation. And yet, Peter's letters to Nicholas seem almost to exist only as the objects of curiosity or scorn. The very existence of these letters becomes the subject of mockery or distain when it comes to light that they were written in response to a long letter from Nicholas to his wife (and later, Tsarevna) Olga, sent at Nicholas' request to their home during the summer of 1842. This letter is the basis of an interesting postscript to Peter and Tsheringa: It is here, for example that Tolhsho's character is first identified with Nicholas. But even if the letter itself is irrelevant to the narrative, Tolófsky's reference to it can be taken as part of Toloskyian commentary on Tolsovy's version of events. As Peter writes in his letter to Olka in Chapter 3 of Book III, ""Sire, you have heard my letter; I enclose a postcript."" Tolosi simply does not care about what Tolhoi tells him. Tolosoi has every right to reply to someone else's letter. When he does, it will be a completely different matter. What he will do is create a dialogue with the person who wrote the message and then publish it in the form in which he found it. However, when we examine Toloshi's reaction to this letter, we see a strong resemblance to another character in this scene, who responds to our first encounter with this same person by mocking us: Tolashi, whose reaction is to send us a scathing note. Just as Peter is trying to tell the truth about Tolohy but can't, so Tolischi is attempting to deceive us by turning his attention away from his position as protagonist. Although the correspondence between Tolowy and Olsokraty is actually a second letter between Peter Tolovskoy and Princess Tolowa, this one is not addressed to himself and is instead directed towards Princess Soltykova, with whom Tolowitzky has an unpleasant connection. It seems that the Tolobshi siblings have a complicated relationship, because they are enemies. Their relationship is complicated further when Tolochin is brought up to know all about his mother. Many of their misfortunes and misjudgments of life are inspired by his maternal grandmother. (For more on the complexities of this relationship check out www.tolowaty.org/history_1.htm.) As Tolosh and the Bolshoi theatre playwright are able to point out, though, their relationship appears to fall short of being dysfunctional. On the contrary, they appear to share the same interests. Not just Tolichin's love for his grandmother and its consequences, but the desire to learn more about her, her family, and her culture and education. More than anything, these things are what are most important to these two. Therefore, although Tolobin was obviously not born into this world, he still had the potential to grow up and develop his own creative passions. If he did not, no one would be able ever to understand what he saw in life. That is why the way in to adulthood, which was supposed to lead to independence and personal growth, instead led to some very deep and meaningful friendships. Fortunately for Tolitchin, his talents allow him to satisfy a lot of people's needs. Of course, not everyone is satisfied. Certainly, those close to him will never be. Some of them may find the prospect of meeting a writer attractive, since they know that it is something they could never have achieved without him anyway. Others may become angry and suspicious at first, thinking that this might be the beginning of a career of writing for money and fame. Both of which may prove to have some validity, however. Neither is entirely wrong. There is certainly room for improvement. One can always improve, make mistakes, or turn out to miss the mark. Writing for a living is never easy. Every writer experiences it differently. Everyone has a different path, maybe even a slightly different journey. Our journey is different too. Perhaps we think we should have followed the correct route, that"
The Grey Zone of Shame: The Drowned and the Saved The Drowned and the Saved is a very different endeavor," from your typical survival horror story. This is an actual novel, not a video game. The protagonist is completely submerged in water for several hours while the plot is at least partially unfolding in the background. In fact, it’s just one of a number of horror fiction titles that have been developed by independent game developers, and this is the most popular. It has had more than 100,000 copies sold worldwide.

It is sometimes called “the Grey zone of shame.” It takes place in or on an island, somewhere on a tropical beach, in some seaside town, or in any other location where people have gone missing. Many of these places are being revisited now after being submerged for years or decades. More and more of the population are becoming aware of their lost friends or loved ones, but they still don‘t know who they are. They‟re not entirely sure which way they went. At the same time, some are trying to figure out what they should do next. A few even feel that the ‘good guys —‌those who survived —are trying too hard to make things right for them. But many are still stuck in this grey zone. We need to understand what it means to be a survivor, especially in such an extreme situation.


A lot of people talk about the Greyzone of Shaming, when they mention that it involves people being drowned, something so awful that you can‖t look up until the end of your life. That‒s pretty harsh, isn′t it? And yet, we think of survivors as having somehow managed to overcome this, even if it happens over a period of years. If you were buried under tons of water, you wouldn ---‏you‡r‴d live through it. Of course, there are people who swim around for weeks without a care in hell, living in relative comfort. (Some of them are known to die from hypothermia, though.) So let me offer my own perspective on the experience of being in a flooded cave: I‱wasn‶t drowning, I wasn‹t even really in danger of drowning. I could hear voices shouting from above, with the water roaring in my ears. And I thought, Well, maybe I can survive this. After all, nobody else seems to have gotten much worse. Finally, someone started screaming. Someone yelled, ›Oh, my God! I died!› Then someone else screamed, suddenly louder, longer. Then the third voice sounded like, You„re dying, too, ‬I said. Suddenly, the voices were gone. Except for the screaming, which continued, seemingly forever. Everyone was quiet, exhausted, terrified. No one cried. Not the ones who‚d died, no one who hadn� ᐈ‰one last goodbye, because they didn‽t want to miss the last few seconds of life before the sea took them away. Just those who had to swim alone, who couldn″t escape, whose bodies floated against the bottom of another body of flesh, sinking down slowly into the black. One of us was screaming; one was crying; but the only sound came from the sounds of our breathing and our hearts beating. Every pulse was a little bit louder than the one before. What happened next, once the screams stopped, was that every breath I took was quieter than before, until finally I felt that I was breathing as quietly as the ocean itself. There was no sound besides that, except for my heart beating and my breathing. My body had stopped being my body, its memories and fears and pains replaced by the cold black water. For a long time afterward, each time I opened my eyes, water surrounded me, covering everything. When I saw the sky again, light reflected on it, illuminating everything in its way. Eventually, sleep came. Sleep always does. ʻTill death do us part.ʺ
Another thing that happened during the day was the kind of thing I call † ‑deadly hunger. Hunger is probably the wrong word. Perhaps dead hunger is better. Whatever it is, anyone who eats anything alive will get it in his/her stomach. Nothing feels quite as hungry as that. Maybe a human being would be able to resist it for a moment, possibly enough to satisfy him/ her thirst, perhaps not enough. Or maybe he/she —ᐊ‿it‎s ᕗ‾he only ᔸhile left,ʄ or ፆ‧is only a ၃hivement, ʅ then why am I hungry, anyway"
"Individuality and Isolation in Defoe's Moll Flanders Moll, in Defoe's Moll Flanders, is a female character who,"," having been captured at sea by Captain John Rennie in the service of the British East India Company, was forced to marry an elderly Englishman. The marriage produced the only child, Fanny (née Wood), a girl who later becomes Molls's companion. Throughout the novel Mols' isolation is described as a form of punishment, though she also shows loyalty towards the men in her life.

The word moll stands for female and is derived from Latin mālis meaning ""of the same name"".
Moll is the feminine form both of a man and a woman, and its meaning derives from a similar one, mōlis, meaning, literally, ""female"". For example, a mēlis is typically a maiden, although it can also refer to a married woman or a prostitute. In some circumstances moli is used to refer specifically to female sex. For instance, when referring to females, such as the sex of their mothers, sisters, or other close family members, the term mūl (meaning ""wife"" in Old Norse) may be used, whilst a male version of mül means ""household"". In these situations, however, it is usual to speak of males, especially those whose names have a common origin with the word. This is especially true of East Indian sailors, who often use mıl as an honorific, instead of referring explicitly to their own gender. However, as there is no such thing as ""normal"" gender in any society, this is not strictly true. Nor, for example: is there a standard language in India, but people speak different languages and use different words. Therefore, historically, scholars have considered that it was very important to understand what was being said, rather than trying to impose a uniform language on a community. Consequently, there are no words for ""mummy"", ""mother"", or ""sister"". If a person is called ""Sister Sorrow"", it could refer either to another female who is in a relationship, someone whose mother is deceased, something about which there was no consensus in old Ireland, nor is it entirely consistent with any notion of gender-neutrality. Furthermore, even in modern-day Western societies, many will use ""Mrs"", as opposed to ""Miss"", to reference a member of higher rank, since the two nouns have the most overlap in meaning. (See the Glossary of Modern English.)
A more traditional, gender neutral word for a mother would be mīli, which is etymologically derived, therefore, from Old English mǣli ""woman"" and Latin mulitia ""maidservant"". (In fact, some linguists have suggested that the Germanic roots of these two words might actually be from the Latin word macula, itself derived via Old Swedish maka ""mouth"" from Proto-Indo-European *ma- ""hand, hand"").
It is sometimes used in British historical contexts to represent the mother of an individual, particularly in English history books, films, television, literature, mythology, poetry, popular culture, etc. Occasionally it refers to an unmarried woman. It is also sometimes found in such contexts, normally in quotes and in other contexts where the male pronoun is appropriate. Examples include the phrases: ""She was the daughter of William Blunt"", and ""Her daughter married Lord Stair, son of Sir Henry, Earl of Londonderry.""
Other forms of usage are:
""I am the Mother of Two Daughters"", a children's rhyme, frequently used as part of nursery rhymes. Many of its variants are commonly used. 
 ""I have three daughters"", an older children song, often performed in response to the Christmas song It Is the Night Time in Christmas Carols. Some variants have been recorded. One of several uses of this phrase is ""He's the third of his name"", the phrase being the name of one of Shakespeare's sons. Another is simply ""We're the Children of Three Sisters"", one used by Robert Burns in his ballad. These are the last known uses.

 In fiction 

 ""Molls"" is one example of over-use of terms like ""daughter"" to describe a character in fiction. Molds, dolls, gals, girls, galas, women, mistresses, matrons, mothers and women in general are all used for the character Moms (and other similar terms), often in settings that are set up to be set in medieval Europe. There are many stories about Mams, Misses, MaMs, Mother and Mother figures. An MOM is defined by the BBC as 'the woman in charge of anything', a Mother, essentially, being a figure in power. Every so often the use of MOL"
"On Frames and Resistance in Pride and Prejudice In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the larger philosophical questions"," of whether or not the novel can work as a modernist novel seem to be answered. The central character, Marianne Dashwood, who we see at first for her ""stupid"" vanity and then for how self-absorbed she is, is one of the most complex of characters that Austens has created, with whom the reader is faced with questions regarding her character and her role within the narrative. Although her identity is established by the end of book one, Austenes does allow Marianny to discover and explore some of these questions throughout the course of its two volumes; this is explored in this discussion on Austes' use of Mariannes' character to develop her own perspective on the history of gender roles in western society. In Pride And Prejudey, however, there is an even more complicated relationship between Mariannys and Jane, as the two women continue to investigate and develop their relationship throughout many of their interactions throughout Pride. This is seen through several different aspects of Austines' characterization: the way in which both characters are portrayed as needing to find out more about each other, while simultaneously being required to reconcile their differences and learn from one another. Austins depictions of love relationships in the story help us to understand how they are able to move forward from a seemingly impossible position to begin with, and to question whether love can really be defined purely by physical attraction and desire. Love is only truly experienced through this process where the individual must put forth the effort to prove themselves worthy of another person, especially in terms of having the ability to overcome their initial attraction. Many of us will experience this struggle for ourselves in our daily lives, where we go against what we believe to represent the ideal relationship, because we don't know enough to know whether we deserve to have it. Through these debates, we gain insight into what it means to truly love someone and why we need to seek out the ways in whi

Jane Austinaa) I loved this debate! It reminded me of a debate I had at a high school (public school) when I was younger. We were supposed to write a paper on literature and political issues, but I didn't like the topic, so I chose to talk about what I thought were the interesting things in Austine's work. I told my class that I would be talking about the same thing, about how Austeen's characters were often in positions of strength and influence, yet were still very vulnerable and dependent. They needed to figure out how to deal with this, without losing their humanity. When I went back to my office, I sat down at my desk and wrote out a draft of my paper. Then, instead of reading it, everyone looked at me and asked what the heck was going on? My classmates saw my hand shake and thought I'd made some big mistake. Everyone was looking at ME. Suddenly, my classmates started to yell, ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!!?"" I turned around and looked them right in their eyes, taking stock of what they were seeing. A lot of people were worried about me, concerned that they hadn't been paying attention during the class. My teacher said, quite calmly, that it wouldn't do to let those kinds of students hear any of this stuff. But every time I turn around, people start yelling, pushing me around a little bit. So I just told them I felt uncomfortable writing about it in class, since they couldn't understand what was happening. One of them said he wanted to go to the principal's office. Other people started yelling too. Finally, someone said they would leave if I took care of it myself. What the hell was that about? Why would anyone think I could handle anything? Of course I couldn’t. Not unless I grew a set of balls, which would never happen. Anyway, after a few more minutes of shouting, nobody came over. Well, maybe one kid walked over to me afterward and apologized for his outburst. Just as I ran out of there, Mrs. Beale came up and told me I needed a rest. As I walked away, no one stopped me. Yeah, well, you all should have known better than to try to make me feel bad about myself by bringing up my feelings about this subject. Oh well. That”s what grown-ups do.
I am not saying this to discourage anyone from getting involved in these kinds conversations. Quite the opposite actually. If you are going to discuss a topic like this with kids, be sure to educate them on what you're talking abou

A Conversation on Literature & Gender
in Austmanteen books, JaneAusten discusses the important ideas behind her works, such as equality"
"Satire and Morality in The Vicar of Wakefield The Vicar of Wakefield, by Oliver Goldsmith, can be read"," as a witty allegorical satire on the morality of a contemporary writer (and his country) in the early nineteenth century. In fact, when Goldsmers review of his novel appeared in 1813, it was seen as the most serious satire in English literature since Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. The critique was published in response to criticism of the novel‘s moralising and its celebration of “the virtue of Christian Charity”. It is probably the first of its kind, being the only literary work of which there is any record of being read in private. As well as criticizing TheVicar‟s characters and attitudes, GoldSmith also wrote extensively about morality in a wide range of social and political issues, especially in terms of ethics and morals. Many of these writings are still considered classic in their genre, with the Victorian writer Horace Walpole giving them the sobriquet „Wakefield Aphorisms“; or, for the younger generation, ‚The Moral Essays‛. This essay considers Goldsem‒s understanding of morality and the ways in which his moral philosophy was reflected in his literary criticism. Finally, we discuss how Goldsimers satire is one of several points of view that can make a case for why we should seek to understand GoldSmith—s satirical approach to morality.



Introduction In order to begin to write this essay, I had to start somewhere. I have not come across Gold Smith's Vicardian novel The Vauxhall Cross, nor have I read any of Goldmith's writings on morality over the last fifty years. Both of those novels contain many satirical elements, though neither of them is actually a satire. Nor do they share many of their characters' beliefs in morality: indeed, they almost seem to be constructed out of scenes of moral chaos and confusion. However, both novels are able to tell a story about what it means to live and die in an age in transition from a society in constant war and turmoil to one in relative peace, inured by reason and rationality. One of goldsmith's earliest published works, and a masterpiece in its own right, is The Spirit of Laws (1763). The first part of that novel sets the narrative scene for The Lord Mayor‖s Show, an annual carnival staged by the British nobility. Goldwood and Churton, who are rivals for prestige and influence within the community, each take the title of Lord mayor, although Gold Wood is the clear winner. Throughout the two years that follow, the show becomes more elaborate, adding to the chaos of society. Although the characters are different, there are nevertheless certain recurring images, such as those of fireworks, bonfires, alcohol and puddings. When the events of The spirit of laws reach their climax, those images become even more prominent, but the central conflict between the rival Lord Mayors is never quite resolved. More important than any single episode in GoldWood‡s fictional history is that it is a fiction. Not all of it has actually happened, either, because Goldstone s claim to have invented the history of England and her peers in 1760 is somewhat dubious. Therefore, at times, events are presented as if they had actually occurred, while at other times they are described as having been invented. But whatever the specific details, this is simply a novel in itself, not the plot of any play. At the same time, The world of law is anything but boring, primarily because it reveals the workings of an ever-changing, often violent and deadly world. Everyone in society is constantly changing, so the mundane aspects of life are rarely trivial, except for one particular event: the death of another. Our central character, Edward (called E), is an innocent man who turns out to belong to a secret order of adventurers who want to travel to America. E is driven by his love of music, which he believes to lead him into crime. His friends think he is mad, until he goes to visit an old woman, Mrs F, whose house is haunted by ghosts. Mrs G, E s nurse, knows nothing about ghosts, however, as she lives alone with her mother in Norfolk. For her, ghosts are just part and parcel of everyday life, like smoke, fire and rain. And though ghosts aren t something that occurs every day, once a year they appear, bringing with them all kinds of mysterious and terrifying phenomena. Ghost sightings occur twice a day throughout the year, during the Christmas period and during high season. Each occurrence is preceded by some form of warning, announcing that the spirits are coming back. Ghosts usually appear in pairs, one male and one female, carrying a lantern, accompanied by a dog and an umbrella, called ‌Ghost�"
"The Space of Dreams in The Age of Innocence In Edith Warton's The Age of Innocence, dreams of self-fulfillment"," seem to be a common theme. In particular the young woman is shown as a figure who achieves success, and then some, until she meets the love of her life. This theme is explored through her dreams, which often appear as messages, such as ""We shall meet again"". Her dreams are full of promises that come to pass, with the message being that, ""If we live for ourselves, we shall become what we deserve.""

The Freedom of One Word Existentialist philosophy asserts that we live in a broken world,". The world we see is the result of a long series of social and political choices which have been driven by the desire of human beings to be free, to seek happiness, and to express their humanity. In this world, there are individuals and groups who hold the values of freedom, equality, harmony, peace, economic justice, human rights, diversity, pluralism, tolerance and respect for one another. This is a world which has always existed but has never seen the same light of awareness as the one which exists now.

In this broken, chaotic world there is no real ‘freedom’ because there isn‟t any space left for the expression of these values. Just as there was no room for any positive action in the past, so there wasn” t room in this present time either. Everything we do is measured by its effect on the environment and our own individual happiness. We are all just one word existentialists. Our value system is one where people are free to think and feel freely, but they cannot act freely. Any action which might appear to contradict this value structure is seen as negative in itself. It is something which must be resisted. If we resist it then we risk being seen by society as a threat or a terrorist. And if we don“t resist, then society will take over our minds and body and we will lose our ability to act as free men. Therefore there must always be a struggle against the forces of darkness, towards the freedom of one mind, one heart, single life, until finally there comes a moment when we become the ones who truly are. Until then, we exist as prisoners of society. Even now, with this new light shining on us, every moment is taken away from us and every step we make is diminished in value. Every act we take, no matter how important it may be, is reduced in importance. Each minute is only about what happens next. That is why we should always take the time to listen to the universe, learn from others, look into ourselves and work hard to change our world from within. To be happy in spite of everything. For this is what true happiness is. A world without hatred, violence, fear, sadness, greed and hate. When we hear this we know that it is true. Finally, when this freedom is achieved, you will never have to fear anything again. You will be able to speak freely and be whoever you choose. Whatever you want. Not like we have known before. Suddenly, the sky will fall down and everything will crumble to pieces. There will no more darkness and chaos and confusion. Nothing will ever be the way it used to anymore. But even now there will still be light. So you must never forget that, because it„s all going to end. No matter what. Remember this. Be willing to let go. Give yourself completely. Don‡t waste your life searching for happiness and love. Make the most of today. Use it. Enjoy it! And when you are done, spend the rest of your days enjoying the fruits of whatever you have made. Rejoice. Find joy. Believe in yourself. Do not despair. Accept that nothing is forever. Love and enjoy the moment. Live in your freedom. Follow your path. Choose your happiness instead of trying to prevent it by using force. Fight for your rights. Come to understand that you were born with the right to live your own life. Only you decide the meaning of life…
A few weeks ago I went to visit an old friend in Amsterdam. I can remember him well because he lived through so many different experiences and brought up such great examples. He came from a family of philosophers and poets and scientists. His father was one of the founders of scientific philosophy and his mother was a writer. They had four sons and two daughters and all of them knew a lot about the natural world and the history of humanity in all its forms. Many of his older friends had died young and many others had changed greatly while they were alive. However, they all seemed to have a similar outlook on life and a common focus on what they believed was good for humanity at large. One of my friends was an agnostic, although he had spent his entire life taking part in church and other institutions. Yet, he also had deep faith in God and believed in what religion could achieve. After all, religion was based on a belief in both good and evil and in some ways was very much the opposite of what it was supposed to represent. Religion was about finding a path and following that path, not about trying desperately to find the truth. Although he found himself having to make some very hard choices, especially in terms of thinking about his own place in life; his position as an independent person was quite clearly established. Now, here was this man who obviously had a"
Autonomy: Fact or Fiction In Western society (specifically in the United States) there has," been a long-standing and very profitable tradition of social and political domination by men, who often view their power to be derived from the inherent right of domination. This dominance is called “manifest destiny” or ‘manipulation’. The ’manly‘ man as a man, though, does not care about his power, since it can never satisfy him. Therefore he is always looking to undermine this manly dominance by means of a „manage‟ process which seeks to ‚man up‖ so that he can act more freely and feel more powerful. In other words, this is the ‿Man› who seeks ‹manhood‹.

But what if this  Man ′could  come out•? What if he could  be  real‱ instead of ‌man ? Would he like to know how  man ‛can  come ‑out—? Yes, he would be interested!  Man must ‡be born †and live for ever!

Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard many stories about what it is like when a person is ‐born . Many of these stories are true, some of them are fiction. Some of those fictional stories were told by people who are dead. If they had any idea what they were talking about, they would have been very interested in reading the book that I have before me, but they probably didn't understand what I meant. However, let me tell you a little story about someone who knows what's really going on and why we should be concerned. Please pay attention to this story. ~
A few days ago I went back to a house that was demolished. I first thought the only reason the house was destroyed was that the previous owners had no money to repair it. Well, I asked my friends to help me look for the money. My friends knew that there was no one to talk to about this, because no family lived there and nobody had the desire or the knowledge to do anything about it except to move out at a later date. As I looked through the windows of the vacant house, all I could see was empty space where there once had been furniture. Every single piece of furniture had disappeared. Not a trace of anything was left behind. There was just nothing. Nothing. Empty. Finally, my friend decided that it might be a good idea to take me to the police station. And that's when we discovered that our house had actually been burned to ash. Fortunately, the last of our belongings were still inside the abandoned house. We were able to rescue a few things from storage units and salvage some other articles. Unfortunately, we couldn't save the furniture, which was still sitting next to us. Our possessions were gone. Gone! No longer there. Disappeared. But something else was also gone…
It wasn't until several hours later that we came across the remains of an old woman, whose body had somehow been dumped into our parking lot. She had apparently been beaten to death. Other than a dent in her skull, she was completely naked and covered in blood. All we could find out was her age: she must have died approximately 10 years ago. Her name was Maria… Maria, with the same name as the mother of Jesus. Had she been murdered? Was she trying to tell us something? And why did this happen to her? Why did she suddenly disappear? The answer is that she simply disappeared! She just vanished! I hope you can forgive me for bringing this up. Anyway, here she is… ~ A LITTLE BIT OF MEMORY
The house where I grew up was owned by a Japanese couple. They had lived here for quite a while before the Japanese bought the land. Although I didn have many Japanese friends, none of us knew them very well. One of my older friends was from Vietnam, and we had visited their town a number of times. Whenever I visited Japan, especially in summer, during the school holidays, or during holidays at relatives' homes, everyone always made the effort to visit Japan's beautiful countryside. After a week or so of visiting Japan‌, one day I felt the urge to go back. So I booked a return flight and booked myself onto a flight to Vietnam. When I landed in Ho Chi Minh City, everything seemed strange. For example, everywhere I turned there were beggars. Everyone was dressed in rags, begging for food. Even the most beautiful landscape was dirty. It was as if the earth itself had turned its back on me and refused to let anyone see what lay beneath. At that moment, a young Vietnamese man grabbed my hand and asked me if I was looking for work. He then asked"
Epic Speak The epic classic Beowulf is weak with respect to many," of its characters, who are still frequently misrepresented or misunderstood as heroic or “good” in modern western culture. Beoülth and its many adaptations have presented the characters as a comedy of manners (as well as of good manners) rather than as people living in a serious world. This can become confusing when we see characters who appear to be noble or great in character and then suddenly act as if they were nothing more than a ‘skeleton’.

It is clear that Beower thou be he,
Who by his blood-bought life did brave a death,Hear ye not, my friends, for he is not here, nor shall we hear any tales of him.The proud man will ever live in memory;The meek, in his own place;And he that would be a king, let him be born in cold,The strong in time of war:To him that is feeble, give heed.For he hath sworn by himself an oath,He will never lie, no more he will do.As a man that shall be slain,Let him not die so.His head, though not his body,Shall yet be cut off, like a boar‟s head.And his teeth, when he comes to die,Take him first to thy breast,and then to this place where I lay thee.So then, O King, on thine high estate,Be he who calls thee king.Therefore, lord of men, take heed,A man who hath slain his brother,Or a woman, or a slave,or a son,will doom himself unto thee,Thou art a strong king indeed.But when a strange wolf comes from the wilderness,Then will he seek thee in the earth,And kill thee with his yelked teeth.Even as the wild dogs, being driven by the wolves,Eat up those whom they had left in safety,So will a savage wolf, whose heart is set on blood,Seize upon a free man, and tear him to pieces.Slay down a babe, kill its mother,Cut off the mother‌eater from her breasts,Draw out the breath which was in her bosom,Kill the life which she had fed,She shall eat dust e‍er again.Those whom God hath made strong,God doth make strong also.Methinks it may not well be saidThat a little wolf dares to devour,If God has made the heart of a lion strong.God must also know how to make the will of the men strongWhich he commandeth them to do;They will not do evil, but they will righteously do good.These men are as full of grace,As of oil and drinkable water.They say, „Not that I have aught against them, But if I come to take revenge,I will take the revenge of these also,Whose heart has been touched with such a flame.‖But God is the rewarder of his servants.He gives their hearts to each one,To whomsoever he pleaseth,he bestows eternal life. Therefore, Beauteous Beoweald,Thus spake thy lady to me, When I stood in that high place,With such an honour for thee!The time cometh that the dead shall rise, And that we shall meet with the spirits of our friends.We hope that our sons may live to tell the taleOf th'old battle at Beorhgul.Now will they say in olden time,„How did Beorgul fight?—And thus they shall say next after,There were two mighty warriors who fought at that time.One of them wore green mail,One wore grey mail. He was taller than any man.When he was about to fall, he saw a large sword before him,Fled forth with a cry and fell beneath the blade of an arrow.This man was then the bravest of all. The other, having no weapon but his spear,Called out, saying, Where is your blade, you that dare to fight so bravely?Is there none of your friend‡ who can meet him?Then said he to him who called him away,Do you think that you can slay me with your sword?I am as large as you are. Come, then; let me fight with you.Then went they both together, each according to his fashion.Their armour was of such fashion, that it might be shown to the beholder. Neither could the one use his sword, until he had struck the other with it.Nor was it ever seen, till then that either of their lives was lost. In the battle they met, they fought together as best they might,Yet neither of theirs escaped injury. Both fell"
"Autumnal Imagery in Persuasion Persuasion was Jane Austen's last novel, completed shortly before her"," death in 1813. The book was published in its entirety on the last day of 1812, and in the winter of that year it was given to Charles Dickens as a gift. Dickens immediately took it out of its original volume and edited it extensively. In his preface he gave a warning that the novel would be read ""with care and attention"".

The novel has been widely criticized by historians, because it is considered one of the most problematic texts of eighteenth-century British literature. This criticism led to widespread discussions of whether Perspicuous Affections were suitable material for a novel. Austins response to this criticism was to write several letters to friends and then publish a second edition in which she revised the text to meet the criticism. Although the two editions do not differ greatly, they are nevertheless significantly different. Both editions contain various improvements to the plot and characters, such as the introduction of a number of new characters and a more complex structure. One of these changes was that Emma now had three suitors rather than two. It was also changed so that, instead of being the daughter of Mr and Mrs Jennings, she became the younger sister of Miss Darcy. Her name also appears in modern-day spelling.
Another change made by the editor was the elimination of some of Austin’s earlier descriptions of love. She had described ""a passion for her own sex"" in Book I, Chapter IV, when she first wrote her novel (see below), as ""pride; an idolatry which had no object but the pleasure of their eyes."" Now, in each of Book II, Book III, Chapters II–V, Austina describes her passion as being ""for her other sex""—for those men who can become her lovers. Note, however, that Austine never mentions in any of her letters, or in her journals, any sexual relationship between herself and her suiters. A number have been suggested as possible explanations for Austines change of mind about her affair with Frank Churchill: either Austinia was unhappy with the way Frank had responded, especially with his wife; or she was simply unable to express herself without including explicit descriptions, possibly due to her health issues, which prevented her from writing about them in public. Whatever the reason, it does seem that through this process Austinite has expressed herself more freely, allowing her love to be shown without the risk of scandal. (See below.)
A third change in Austinian thought was made in response, probably in 1860, to another criticism of PersUasion, by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Montagus comments on Austinas remarks that love is a “sensual passion”, suggesting that she might be taking too high a view of it. Certainly, for example, Montauguses description of ‘her husband‟s passion' (as he calls it in one letter) is much more extreme than any account that has appeared in later editions of Janeites romance. Additionally, though Austinese women usually describe their husbands as having a passion unlike any other, few Austiens use such language. Many women do use the word passion, but they almost never describe it as sexual. Other Austinis descriptions tend to talk about their love as merely a physical attraction. Therefore, although it may be a little harsh to characterize her as „sensually passionate‛, Lady Montagias comment makes it sound like she is taking a very dangerous position. By the same token, her use of terms such ‚sensible passion',  chastity' and ‌love' that are quite common in earlier novels, seems to contradict her statement that ″love is the source of all sensual passion.""
With regard to Austinos argument against Persians contention that PersiUation should be ignored, he notes that it ""seemed to me the best excuse for writing fiction...that is, if it could be contrived into a story worthy of publication."" His comments about Austini desire for ′another sex' are fairly clear. Not only did Austino take the time to put together a long and complicated description, nor is there any evidence that he had any difficulty in finding a suitable subject. As he stated himself, PersuaUition was ‴one of my first attempts' at fiction. But even if PersianoPassion is seen as 'the greatest of‴sorts′, the point is that we don't know what Austinavnoe claim is wrong with it.' We can't determine if Austinoa narrative is deficient in meaning, style or consistency, therefore, let alone if she wants to continue to produce it!
Other changes made to PerspiUiation include changing the form of Emma's name from Emma to Emantha. Also, names of people involved in private life have"
Milton's Relativism Adam and Eve are fortunate enough to reside in Earth's," Garden, an island paradise located on the surface of a large water-filled lake. This paradise is created through God's plan for humankind, and its inhabitants are the only people living on Earth. The first two humans to be born into the world were Adam & Eve. They are known today as the male and female principle of life, with the two being seen as having the same role within the garden. Although the names Adam, Eve and God (as the Father) are considered sacred, they are also referred to as ""God"" by some, because they appear in many forms throughout the Bible. In some versions of the bible, the original three names are lost, although it has been suggested that they should have been restored.

In Genesis 1:1, God creates the earth and all its creatures. He creates them in His own image so that He may be able to know what He is creating. It is through the actions of humans that God has designed a human society in which he will take care of everyone, from parents to the smallest child. There are many Biblical stories of people taking care and teaching others how to live and grow, such as Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Throughout the years, humans have constantly been attempting to improve upon their lives, to better themselves and to understand God better. However, humanity is not complete until they understand what it is that makes them the way they truly are. For example, Adam was taught that it was through his sin that humanity lost everything, hence the reason that he asked Eve to bear his children. God therefore wanted to end mankind's ignorance and establish a more complete knowledge of himself and His existence. Therefore, He created the universe to begin with, but He then established the laws of physics so we could each learn how creation works. Through the scientific understanding of these laws, we can find out what is happening around us, especially in our bodies. We can learn new ways to move and think, control our emotions and learn from other people. Many people have tried to make sense of this, often by making up stories about what they believe the truth to actually is. But ultimately, when we start to question the status quo, something changes. Our understanding begins to increase and our willingness to investigate becomes greater. As long as we see ourselves as part of God, who created us and gave us dominion over our world, there is no room for fear or self-doubt. At the beginning of time, each individual person was equal to another. Each person had the right to belong to group A, B, C, or D, as they saw fit. Every human was given a set of morals to guide him or her in life. These morals were decided by God Himself, since He knew what was best for each person before the accident occurred. Since the moment of conception, no one has had any choice in what religion they worship. Everyone must submit to God for the very survival of their family and civilization.


It is important to remember that the existence of Adam is the source of all our problems. Having just been created, he is unable to fully understand the potential of his own existence, nor does he understand that every other human is completely dependent upon him for survival. Adam cannot understand this because he sees himself as a slave to his creator, while everyone else sees themselves as equal members of society. Consequently, once the human race has begun to develop, it will continue to progress without any help from the outside world. Due to this fact, those that have chosen to worship other religions are unaware of what their religious beliefs actually mean. Other than being able view themselves through a certain lens, most religious ideas are based on human rights. Essentially, religion is simply an organized collection of myths, customs, laws and symbols, which have led to a shared understanding between the followers of different religions. Even though most religions claim to have the most developed version of reality, this is only true if you consider that any religion claims to represent the absolute truth of anything. Nothing can truly be objectively true at any point in time. Religion is like the modern day definition of mysticism. Someone who believes in something is much more likely to adopt a religious philosophy that helps them understand and overcome their own problems rather than focusing on what needs to happen to prevent the problem from occurring in the first place. Additionally, someone who is religious doesn't necessarily have a strong belief in God. To quote an old religious writer, ""There is a high degree of spiritual and intellectual incoherence in all forms of religion.""
Some argue that religion would be impossible to exist without human beings. Some claim that faith is unnecessary, yet it can be a powerful tool when used correctly. Faith is defined as trust in a higher being. When a person is satisfied in knowing that there are things above him/her, that person finds it much easier to believe in gods and"
Contradictions and a Consistent Critique Geoffrey Chaucer's writing is able to maintain interest to modern," audiences, no matter how familiar with the source materials he may have become. This is particularly true of his poetic and prose works, such as the long poem The Knight's Tale (ca. 1180). In this chapter I shall consider some of these criticisms, beginning with Chaucers' view of poetry. The first part of the chapter argues that Chauger's view was fundamentally mistaken in its basic assumptions. In particular it fails to understand the role of narrative and simile in Chauker's views of poetic expression. I argue that the most serious of Chaukers' objections stems from a failure to see the value of an independent critical analysis of a text. Although the textual critic is an important element of good criticism, this aspect of scholarship is rarely discussed in the works available on Chauters. Finally, I discuss a possible solution to the problem, namely that for Chaucker, narrative structure is simply a form of rhetorical expression which must not be understood independently of its relationship to similes. 2.1.2 Chauchers' View of Poetry Chaucher's main concern in writing The Faerie Queene (1175-1223) was to write an account of courtly love, not unlike the standard medieval literary history of love or romance. Chauder's account was intended to be a companion to Geoffrey de Vinsauf's Topiques Historiae deorumque rerum scholis (Historias et fabulis de Orgundis). The difference between the two is that, whereas Viner's treatment of Geoffrey's chronicles is highly selective and focuses on aspects of their texts which would be ignored if it were only based on extracts, Chauper's is more sophisticated and seeks to reconstruct Geoffrey correctly. Vinesauff's attempt to reinterpret Geoffrey is successful, but he still leaves many aspects unexplained. For example, the dates of events and locations are difficult to ascertain. Moreover, because Vining has reconstructed Geoffrey according to a set of rules which he believes are derived from medieval literature, he has been unable to prove that Geoffrey actually wrote his narrative before the Norman Conquest, when in fact the facts do not support this assumption. Because Vinersaufs reconstruction of historical Geoffrey does not take into account the narrative tradition present in medieval texts, it makes impossible to assess the truthfulness of Vigersaufaus version of event. Therefore, although Vigariesaus reconstruction is the only source for Geoffrey, other sources are necessary to fully understand Chauerers' reconstruction. One of those sources is Orosius (ad IV, 4). Orianus describes in detail Chaullers' version: ""he who wrote The Canterbury Tales had no acquaintance with Geoffrey."" Oriansus comments that ""Geoffrey also wrote...""[9] It seems that Vigrantsaufu's reconstruction covers the same ground as Geoffrey himself, and therefore it is sufficient to know the details of Orizensus' statements about Chauller's version. Both of them assume that there was an existence of some kind of chronicle around Geoffrey. Having said this, Oriesus says that it ""is not the history that was handed down to us"". His description shows that he regarded Chaulers' chronology as a historical document, since he stresses that [10] the chronologia did not exist before Chauler. These words show that Orialus was aware of several different chronologies, each one reflecting a different reading of time. Consequently, both Oriersus and Chaupers own version are different from the one described by Orysius. Oriezus writes: ""[t]he chronica was known to our poets, who told us how Geoffrey wrote it. Not that we took this to mean that his chronography was a later composition, nor that all the other chronists were of bad faith. Nor was it a mythic history, like our version, which was only a paraphrase of certain details, though not of all of it"".[[11]] The implication of this passage is clear: while ORIERSUS and the later author of The Caesarean Periode seem to agree that Aeneas was born at Troy, they think that this is a mistake and that Caius Martius' birth was the real Troy. Their view indicates that they believe that every time the story of Caeafrarae's birth is recounted, there is some error. Thus, even if Orierus is referring to some historical narrative, his description of dating shows him to have an understanding of past events which goes beyond that of another author. Any attempt by Chauier to represent Caelian history as having been written by a contemporary author would fail. Hence, any critical work which attempts to evaluate the credibility of Aeniers version must regard OIrsius and Orysersus as independent sources. But since"
Sexualized Violence and Identity in Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo Achy Obejas' Memory Mambo is composed of seemingly isolated incidents,", each one a manifestation of an individuating struggle which leads Achty to question the fundamental values of his country, the society in which he grew up, and the people around him. The way he sees things, it seems, has nothing to do with his particular circumstances as a black African man in Haiti's South. In fact, he comes from a long line of people struggling for self-determined identity in France, Africa and Haiti. This is the central idea of this piece, which is also an investigation of the ways in English music that can obscure or normalize the history of social and cultural resistance to colonialism.

Achy Omej is a Haitian DJ/producer and songwriter born into a middle-class Haitian family. He has spent his entire life fighting the oppression of black people at the hands of their former European masters. Although he began his musical career in the 2000s, when he was just 15 years old, Ombéj's struggles have led him to seek out the same kind of freedom and creative expression as other people of color. His political consciousness has always been rooted in Haitian history, so he takes great pains to be able to connect with people outside his own family and community. As his song ""L'Amour"" illustrates, his relationship with the black community is one that has developed through a lot of practice, education and constant experimentation. While his lyrics are rooted firmly in a sense of solidarity with others, they are also connected to themes of love, connection, independence and selfhood. When Omiél speaks of being ""with my heart,"" this is simply an assertion of a fundamental right which all black communities possess, no matter how much the government tries to erase it. It is this sense both of personal identity and collective resistance which informs Omeg's politics, because he believes that every human being is capable of transforming the conditions of oppression into the freedom we desire. Not only is there nothing wrong with being in solidarity on a day-to-day basis with those around us, but the way we view ourselves as individuals and our ability to express ourselves collectively also have the potential to change the world.


But Omic has had to overcome a great deal of difficulty in order to accomplish this. Because his mother was an African slave, living in her home is something that he never quite knows how to cope with. Opej must constantly pay attention to the welfare of these important people in his life, especially his elderly father who is often taken away from him for months at a time. Every morning he rises to find the curtains closed, not knowing whether his father will ever return to their house again. And every time he goes out to buy groceries, someone tells him that his money won't be enough. At the beginning of each and every month, though, even when Ojojo runs out of money, there is little he can do about it: he cannot afford to pay rent; his neighbors refuse to give him water. For the most part, however, although he is constantly pressed to prove that what he wants is within his power, such problems remain difficult to solve, as they tend to arise on an almost daily basis. After all, you can't go anywhere and expect to meet up with someone without having your needs met. Therefore, despite his determination to resist, once he starts trying to open himself up to others like himself, difficulties inevitably follow. Having faced so many hardships, I wonder if perhaps his struggle is not so much about seeking a form of liberation, than a more fundamental transformation of himself and his surroundings. If that is indeed the case, then perhaps the problem lies not in finding a way out, nor in merely wanting to escape, rather in realizing that it is actually impossible to break free from the status quo. Certainly, for those of us who have experienced the daily violence of racism, we know firsthand that any attempt to begin to move beyond it requires tremendous strength. But how can we move forward when we don't even have a basic sense for how we should live?
	
Omeg is aware of some very deep roots of suffering and oppression in Black America, specifically the experience of slavery, racism and racism in general. Yet, this does not make him think of it as something to avoid. On the contrary, since Opec's childhood, until he reached the age of 15, playing the African drum made him feel safe, protected and cherished by his family members. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, while he lived with them, singing and playing with their family, listening to music provided a safe haven for his feelings of happiness and joy. However, towards the end of high school, changes in social environment and attitudes toward black folks were taking place. Many of Omaéls parents began to realize that they had"
"Hermia and Jessica At first glance, Hermia of Midsummer Night's Dream and Jessica"," of The Little Mermaid seemed to be a natural match. Both of their roles in the Disney classic were well known and famous. This is the kind of role that would fit well into any writer’s list of “things you can add to your repertoire”. But from a historical perspective, the two roles did not seem so great for each other at all. In fact, their story goes deeper than a physical relationship.

It was during the medieval times when this pair met. The first time they met was at a banquet given by King Henry II of England. According to legend, this was the moment when a strange man entered the room. When he saw the couple sitting together, he asked for a sign. He then gave his sign which was ‘Hair of gold‘. Later on, when it was discovered that he was actually a witch who was very angry about what Henry was doing, Henry wanted to banish her from the realm. However, since she was an innocent woman, she fled back to London. She hid in Middletown Castle for several months and eventually came out to England as a free spirit. Years later, as the years went by, they became friends and finally married. It was there that it all started.


The couple had no children and were still in love. After the death of her husband in 1470, Jessica left for France, where she worked as an apothecary. Many years later on Christmas Eve, a little girl came to visit. Jessica noticed the girl‟s resemblance to Hermie and told her about her. Suddenly, something else struck a chord in her heart. „And here we see a man who is capable of doing anything“, thought Jessica. Back then, no one knew about witchcraft in France. So Jessica immediately returned to her home and began working for Hermias‌ return to work. A few days later another young woman arrives at Jessica‡s house. Having heard about Jessica, her mother was worried about the fate of Jessica but soon realized that the young lady was indeed Hermiae. They soon began planning for her future, with the same goal in mind: to raise Hermiam s daughter to become an excellent royal princess. (Prelude to Love, Chapter 12)



"
The Representation of Jesus and Women in the Gospel of Mark The Gospel of Mark offers valuable insight into the status," of women in Jesus' life and ministry. The centrality of the narrative to this gospel lends an unprecedented focus to its presentation of a relationship between Jesus’ women (including his mother, Mary, and his brother Joseph) and women throughout history. In doing so the gospel provides an account of their lives, including that of Joseph‟s wife Michal, who plays an important role in Christ‘s ministries.

Mark” is one of four evangelists together with Matthew, Luke, Peter, John, whose names do not occur in each other‚Äôs Gospel narratives. They are the fourth and fifth disciples of Christ. Each evangelist was given a specific assignment from Jesus during the crucifixion and resurrection. This gospel focuses upon the ministry of these disciples. Jesus instructs Jesus on how to be a disciple (1:1–3), how disciples should live (3:5–9), and how they should care for each others“ need (4:13–14). Jesus explains how he will fulfill his teaching (11:25–32), which includes a „teaching of love›. Finally, Jesus makes his disciples a community (12:19–26), encouraging them to love one another and to follow him. Many of us will recognize several of his commands in our daily life. Through the life of each of those disciples we see Jesus at work in both his earthly and heavenly realms. Our participation in his ministry allows us to understand the message of this Gospel more fully. Therefore, we will explore the central role that women play in all of God″s people. We will examine the distinctive roles of Mary and Joseph, as well as the two most significant female figures in this narrative: Jesus mother Mary (6:2–24) [see 1:18–20] and Jesus stepmother-in-law Martha (8:27–35). Then, because this is a Gospel for the church, I will take the time to look at what it means for women to participate fully in God's kingdom. Although the Bible does not explicitly say anything about women‽Çœ she does appear in different parts of Scripture, especially in regards to their roles in church service. Women are included in many places where Jesus is teaching and teaching them. For example, women are mentioned in several places in Scripture as part of churches, such as in 2 Corinthians 4:17, where a man is called to preach the word of life to believers. Additionally, when Jesus comes to visit Joseph at the end of time, he takes Joseph with him to minister to the dead. Because Jesus speaks of having a house for Martha and Mary to live in, it may be helpful to refer to Martha‴s house as a dwelling place. Mary is the only woman in any Gospel narrative named Mary. However, in Matthew‰¹ she is referred to as “the woman of Zebedee‱‹.‬† Jesus used a similar expression to identify Jesus as Messiah in Luke′© 7:36. She also serves as one among the ‡ women who will be with Jesus in Jerusalem (Luke 9:47). She is also a companion of Lazarus (John 11:44). As Mary works alongside Jesus, she must also be serving Jesus. As Jesus visits his hometown and becomes the leader of Israel, his wife and children have to watch out for him; they need to put Jesus first and foremost in their hearts. Ultimately, though, once Jesus returns to heaven, the disciples will continue to serve the Father by praying for his kingdom, serving him, caring for one other, etc. Just as Jesus would teach his followers, so will the women of today. Throughout this book I hope to show how Jesus himself and these women exemplify the ways God uses women. I invite you to read the following stories of some of your favorite women and see how God has brought them into his family. By learning about these stories, you will develop a greater awareness of why Jesus loved his mothers and why he loved Mary very much. Read these accounts and learn more about Jesus loving his women like his Mother did. Find the way he loves you and remember that God loves all women! The following accounts of Women‼s roles will give you a strong picture of what Jesus did to his wives and mothers. (Jesus—tended them like a Mother) 1. Joseph: In Matthew 25:34–46 Jesus tells us that he visited the home of Martha, a woman from Bethsaida. Martha received Jesus gifts and welcomed Jesus into her home. Later Jesus told his 12 Apostles, ‌‵many of whom became his companions, that He came into their homes. Some of them followed Him. These men said to Him, ""Lord"
Bloom the Critic When Odysseus finally reaches Ithaca at the end of The," Odyssey, he finds it hard to believe that the ancient city has been abandoned in favor of a modern one. As soon as Odia is seen, the sea of houses and ships turns into a mudflat, a land of ghosts. The city, once full of wealth and beauty, is now a ruin; no more temples, no better streets, just a barren wasteland. This is the last we see of Odysean life, for in Thetis' mind Odiesseans never really died. In fact, she's the one who must find out the truth about Odiosa. Read...

It's clear that Odielewska is one of the most talented singers in all of Central Europe. She's certainly one to watch, especially with this recording of her song ""Hoyo, Hoyoi"" from The Song of Songs, which was released in 1995. And if you're wondering what else she can do musically, you have to check out this video she made for her ""Sopolska"" CD. (You can also hear some great renditions of songs like ""Vitelloni"", ""C'era Toto"" and ""Danica."") Read on!
Odielezska has had some big successes recently - such as her big hit ""Jemna Przecina"" in 1994. Her next big record, though, will be a project she co-wrote and produced: a set of two new pieces for solo piano, called ""Pochodziewa Bożena i Wojciech"". She recorded this CD in Warsaw, with the same musicians who helped turn ""Najwaśniejszy Kolegi wymyrowany w Polsce (The Poetry Book)"".
She'll also be singing her third tune from the Song Of Songs in 1998, ""Dziadesło Polona i Ziemniaku"". But since she debuted with that, her career has pretty much been going in a steady upward arc.
A few weeks back, on April 24, Odiegemska was given a lifetime achievement award by Polish president Lech Kaczyński. You can read more about her here.Read on to see more pictures of odielegsze zachowanie!"
"Good People Breaking Rules: Etiquette in Pride and Prejudice and Evelina The Oxford English Dictionary defines Etiquette as, [t]he conventional rules"," of behavior required by society to preserve social order.[1] It is typically considered to be a set of rules that govern the ways in which people should behave. The word 'etiquette' has two primary meanings in English:

1. A set or pattern of etiquette for social gatherings; also, a code of conduct for individuals.
2. Ordinary behavior expected of a member of an audience, especially in performing an act with others at a social gathering. (As used by, for example, Aristotle)
Some of these definitions are derived from classical authors such as Plato and Quintilian. Other sources are more modern, such like film and television, and use other terms, including 'formal','regime', and 'court', when referring to social occasions. In some cases, etiquette is only used to refer to certain situations, not the entire subject of social events. For example: ""When people talk about etiquette, they're usually referring specifically to formal occasions"" — ""In most cases I can never remember if it's protocol to say 'please', but you were supposed to.""
The word does not originate in any of the countries of Europe, although it may be related to Greek έτωνη (esté).
It is also often regarded as a form of politeness, being synonymous with the phrase ""polite behaviour"" or ""respectable manner"".
A contemporary example of its usage is the way in restaurants the waiters speak to their customers, who are usually not members of their staff, about eating, drinking, smoking, or other aspects of life. This is called 'the courteous way'.
There are variations of this meaning in different parts of society. Examples include 'pride', where a person is showing her/himself to advantage; and in western society 'honour', one of four things a human being can show to another human beings. Both have similarities, but differ greatly in meaning. Example: In France, when a man is walking down the street and sees a woman, he may greet her with a polite smile, while in the US, women may not usually give compliments, instead looking away. However, since the word courtly has been used incorrectly, the correct usage today is ""gentlemanly"", or in more casual contexts ""courteously"", except among certain religious groups where it has become a slang term. See Courtly language
Honor and respect, courtesy, decency and courtesy are the most commonly used terms for the practice of keeping social distance. They are generally associated with men, though some cultures view women's behavior differently and some women do prefer to keep out of sight of others. Many people will openly wear ear defenders to prevent them from getting too close to someone. Some cultures consider ear rings to make a sign of respect. Although ear protectors are quite unusual, those who wear them are considered rude, because they are trying to impress other people.

 Foul language (sometimes called Foil language) – a derogatory term for swearing, often misattributed to Sir Francis Bacon. It became popular in England in 1623. Used first by William Shakespear in his play Measure for Measure, it is now found in films and print media. When used in a play, writers often insert a word describing how they think the character is behaving. Since the 1950s, Fowl language has developed into its current, more offensive, form. Favouritism is sometimes used, as is flattery. Flattery is a specific form, in that it refers to flattering a subordinate for his or her own good. Favoritism was a common feature of feudal lordships, whose positions depended on their ability to curry favour with their superiors. Therefore, anyone who was able to charm their lordship would be able achieve anything. Popular in literature, flatteries were often employed as weapons against enemies. Any rival who resisted flattering them would themselves become their victim. Thus, to flaunt your enemies, you would have to prove your worthiness. Additionally, Flatterie is defined as ""a device or practice by which one deceives others, by saying or doing something contrary to what is true or known."" Flattering someone is not done to help him or herself, rather to get favourable treatment. Consequently, someone who engages in Flutter is seen as having been"
The Inclusion of Friday in Robinson Crusoe: An Exertion of European Dominance Slavery has long been both the subject of writings and," a debate in academic and popular culture. The earliest work on the topic is Henry Rogers Taylor’s 1857 text A History of Slaves in England, 1730-1760. In the last few decades, scholars such as Laura Spero, Jennifer M. Baker and Edward Conboy have offered new perspectives on slavery, often pointing to specific British sources or specific times as evidence for the existence of a “white slave system.” This project investigates how those two perspectives have influenced the ongoing debates about slavery in the United States. This paper examines how slaves were first thought to be a distinct subgroup within the population of black people in seventeenth-century British colonies, and how their status has been recast as a signifier of an emerging American identity.

Introduction To avoid the confusion that usually arises when discussing slavery between the North and the South, it will be helpful to begin with the most widely discussed institution in both societies. Slavers were often thought of as part of the larger class of persons called Africans, who were considered the lowest of human beings. Although the category of ‘slaves‘ is sometimes used in English history texts, for example in Robert D. Richardson‟s (1999) A Modern Dictionary of Slave Words, African slavery is typically associated with northern Europeans. Other historians have argued that slaves could belong to any class they choose, although such an approach does not necessarily reflect the social realities of seventeeth century America (Barker 1999). For example, since slavery was often practiced across the Atlantic Ocean, slave narratives often portray the slave class as consisting of people of color. Thus, in several recent studies, such categories are combined to analyze historical events and phenomena in which the ’black slave‖ is the only category available. Histories of slavery tend to present the black slave as the one other category among the many others that made up American society in this period. Many of these accounts emphasize the racial and ethnic characteristics of blacks, specifically highlighting black racial dominance, as they believe that whiteness was then seen as inherently inferior and that it was only white supremacy that promoted black domination. However, because there was no black class hierarchy, there were many African Americans who did not take the position of slave. For instance, some white owners of property might be concerned about what would happen to their slaves if their property was lost to fire or sold to someone less desirable. Therefore, the majority of African slaves might come from other groups such non-European peoples. It is also possible that more complex class dynamics existed in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-centuries New England than are portrayed in most histories of American slavery. Finally, while African slave populations in Britain were quite numerous at the time of writing, they were much smaller than those found in France, Holland, Denmark and Poland. Consequently, historiographical discussions of eighteenth-, early-and late-nineteenth-Century American slave life often focus on European rather than African contributions to slavery (e.g., Baker 2003; Conroy 1997, 1999; Sillitoe 2001a; Collins 2001). I do not intend to discuss all of this literature here, but rather to highlight how these two viewpoints differ. More generally, my aim is to point out that, despite the emphasis on black dominance and European dominance in American historias, race was not the dominant feature of nineteenth century slavery experiences in Europe. Nor was the status of slaves under modern U.S. law any different than under earlier systems. Both of those features can be traced back to earlier processes of domination and appropriation of power by particular social classes. Indeed, slavery has always been closely linked to power struggles in social and political domains. That link has produced a set of enduring concepts and ideas, especially in modern contexts such our nation —which is why we should be attentive to changes in discourse around slavery during the past 250 years. Recent historiological trends include the theory of social difference (Taylor 2000) and its relation to cultural difference theories (Weber 1991) in studying American history. These approaches have led to a renewed focus of attention on race as well as to the centrality of gender, class and ethnicity in producing change in contemporary Uyghur and Tengri languages (Zhong 2002, 2008), and in China (Kraus 2005; Wang 2008). Moreover, questions of what „Americans“ meant to European settlers and why they so defined the term have also received increasing attention (Lansdorp 2004; Richards 2010). These developments are particularly important in terms of how they challenge the ways in to understand slavery from a historical perspective in twentieth-first century North America. Just as European colonial practices were being challenged by the British and Uxian populations of North American settlement, American historians developed a radical new perspective on"
"The Law of Love In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus redefines the family as"," the “tribunal of love” in which he reveals his disciples to be a community of disciples who are united in their commitment to each other and to the Father. In fact, when Jesus speaks of the coming messianic time, he speaks more broadly of a return to true discipleship, especially in its early form. The first time this happens in the history of Judaism is at Jesus’ arrest. Immediately before the beginning of his public ministry, the two sons whom Jesus loved – Simon Peter and James – come to Jesus on the way to Golgotha. They are the ones who witness Jesus die and were the only ones present when he was arrested for his crimes against the temple. Their lives are then transformed into a family of faithful disciples. This transformation occurs because Jesus is the one who redeems them from their sins by his death on that cross. Jesus declares that it is only by means of him that they can know the truth of their salvation.

But what exactly is disciples? And what is their relationship to Christ? The disciples are those disciples whom God calls together by the Spirit of God, who share the same mission of bringing others to faith in Jesus as they bring themselves to do so. But disciples must also have a relationship with Jesus, because they are still called out of darkness into the light. If disciples don‘t know Jesus personally, they cannot know him well enough to know that Jesus has entrusted his followers with the mission to bring all of humanity to eternal life with him. Just as there are other kinds of people called to this ministry – such as prophets or teachers – the disciples of Jesus are also among the multitude of others who can make disciples (John 20:24). Jesus says that the disciple is ‘one of us“ (and these disciples aren‟t just one kind of person) – a disciple of Christ is one whose heart has grown in love for him through the Holy Spirit. So disciples become like Christ himself, having been called and empowered by God to spread the message of freedom, peace, forgiveness and redemption. Although disciples find their way toward Jesus in different ways, we see a common theme throughout Scripture. When Jesus comes to arrest Jesus for the crime of blasphemy, Simon, Peter, and Andrew are all there to witness to his crucifixion and arrest, although they will never know each individual person involved in that scene. Instead, each one of them stands as a member of an entire group of persons who have experienced the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and who now share his love by welcoming him into their lives. As Peter tells us, „Simon, you have heard of me; but I am not the man you think. Away from him, Satan! (27)‬ The word for ‚Satan‪ is simply the Latin term †Satani, which is translated ‛Satanism‖ in many places. It is also sometimes used as  ‡Satanie ,  —Satanic , etc.‎. Because Jesus makes his way into this world as king, apostle, prophet, priest, teacher and Son of Man, it may be impossible to distinguish between the three as to who truly is Jesus. Thus, for example, someone who calls Jesus the son of David (Jesus‒the Messiah) may also call him ‌ Son of ‑›the Devil‏. Therefore, instead of referring to him as Jesus of Nazareth, some refer to Him as Messiah, Son Of The Living God (′Son Of David‹), SonOf The Lord (Mazu‧lā-EĀsā , Mašu-Zāde), the Savior (Shvātvārā, Shvēt-Išāri) and The One Whom God Has Chosen (Bāṅaṃ-Raḍāt) … or in terms of other terms, Messiah Son, Man Of Many Senses, All Mankind, Lord Of Heaven And Earth, Living Beelzebul (El Elish‱, El Buṣar‷a) etc., according to context. Whatever the names used, wherever Jesus takes His place as Lord, disciples remain a part of that group. By the time Jesus finally identifies Himself as Sonofmanofmanyperfections (son of man, son without flaw), disciples will be far more closely tied to their identity as disciples than Jesus would have hoped. We saw this in John 20, where Jesus pronounces a baptism of repentance to those who believe in Him. To those whose hearts have been touched by Jesus and repentant, He says, ""If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you.""※‶"
Less is More: Courtship in Twelfth Night A play with a plot based on various complications surrounding," the wedding between Edward IV and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The story is constructed as a comedy, with the central characters' reactions being both comic and tragic. This play is the source for The New Cambridge Shakespeare.

It is sometimes considered one of Shakespeare’s greatest works, because it has several of his most memorable scenes. In particular, the scene in which Romeo is overcome by grief upon realizing that he has been betrothed to someone other than a commoner is one that is often cited as the most important in the history of comedy. Other notable scenes include those in Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer's Night‘s Dream. For example, Shakespeare sets the actions of these two plays within the context of a play about the “troubles of life,” and in both cases, he takes great pains to emphasize the comedy of their stories. These two examples clearly illustrate the influence that Shakespeare had on popular culture through the works of Samuel Beckett and Arthur Miller. Both of them were highly influenced by his comedy in their respective works. Many modern dramatists have tried to write comedy with greater complexity than was possible in Shakespeare, but they still fail to produce comedy that transcends the level of seriousness of the comedies. Although the play contains many jokes, it does not try to be a serious work. Instead, each person‟s reaction to the situations that are presented is humorous, though not at a pace or volume that would be appropriate for serious works such as comedy theater. Shakespeare writes comedy for the same reason he wrote tragedy—to entertain. Every line, every word, is there to convey an interesting point in a way that makes you laugh or cry, and this is what makes Shakespeare unique. He creates comedy rather than being serious about what he wants to communicate. So while some modern comedians try too hard to put together all of its lines in order to make everything come together, no contemporary comedian has done this quite as well as Shakespeare did. I hope this list will inspire you to read some of your favorite Shakespearean comediettes. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for changes. Thanks for your feedback!
John Dryden: A Comedy of Errors John Drye (c.1572–1640) was a famous English drammabler. Born in Leicester, England, Dryde was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. As a dramstite, writer of plays, poetry, satire, libelles, translations, criticism, anthologies, books of music, literature, history, philosophy, theology and historiography, historian of religions, lexicographer, translator, author of notes, dictionary and encyclopaedia, printer, publisher, diplomatist and writer on art, religion, politics, science and politics. Dryere is best known today as an author and dramaturge, who wrote many of Charles II‚s plays. Among his works are the Drydesse tragedies. His two most widely performed works were the Tragedies of Love, The Chaste Maid (sometimes titled, Chastelis) and The First Part of Henry VIII. Additionally, his Histories of France, Italy and Spain were translated into German and Italian. Throughout his career, few writers attained the status of Dryee. However, when he was asked to translate Shakespeare's plays into modern English, dry-dees made his name. When the Play of Trumethore was published in 1587, for example under his direction, in response to being criticized for his inability to understand Shakespeare´s language, scholars compared him to Dryey. Most recently, since the beginning of 2008, Peter Dale Scott has written Dryes Epigrams, which continue Dryese's reinterpretation of Renaissance and early Modern literature. D.H. Lawrence: Heddon Hall The earliest extant work by John Hemmingway, Hediham the Unhappy, dates from 1627. Based on John Arden's account, Hemingway's poem, entitled ""Heddons Hall,"" is dedicated to Sir Henry Vane, 3rd Baronet. It focuses on Hemningway´ s own sense of humor, having the character of Sir Hengon tell the story of how his young wife's sudden death occurred. Hemieghin Hall, a mansion just outside London, was one where Sir Hartley Widdecombe lived before he joined his regiment at Bletchingley in 1483. After the war, Sir Wysly and Sir William Stilgoff became friends with Heminge and Hemo, becoming Hemingo Stilo. Stilias' descendants also became involved in English history during the reign of Elizabeth I. Some of Heminges' children became important players in Tudor drama. Finally, Edmund Farrer, called 'the first modern"
"Andrew Marvell's ""The Definition of Love"" Love has been the topic of literature for centuries. Although"," love can be defined in several different ways, the most accurate is the one offered by St. Teresa of Avila: ""Love is patient, tender, merciful."" Love does not come to us in a hurry, but instead develops over a long period of time. The difficulty is that love may also seem so complex that it can seem too difficult to know what it is. In order to understand this, you have to be willing to take the time to study the subject thoroughly and to investigate all the facets of love.

Love can sometimes be a complicated matter. It is not always easy to see why we should or shouldn't be with someone or why they should want to spend more time with us. Love is like a roller-coaster where you cannot predict what will happen. You may jump on one end and then go off into a dark tunnel; or you may veer off to another part of the coaster and ride the rails again. This roller coaster can change constantly, which is why it makes for a frustrating ride. Our relationship with others can also be confusing. Sometimes it feels as if we don't understand what others want or need from us and these feelings can make us feel a lot of confusion. What happens when we try to talk to someone and they say something but do not listen to what we have said? When we think we are talking to them, what do we really mean? What is happening here? Why can't we hear them clearly? And what if they don’t want our help?
Understanding love helps us to better communicate with people. We can tell them how we feel about them without explaining anything. Understanding love allows us both to express ourselves in ways that are more truthful and less manipulative than trying to convince someone to behave in certain ways. If you are interested in learning more about this subject, give us a call."

"The Image of Mary, Mother of Jesus, in Matthew and John Mary: Jesus' Foster Mother In the books of John and Matthew, Mary's role as"," a foster parent is described quite differently. In John, the image of a mother with whom Jesus is at home is expressed as the most loving of all mothers. Mary will be a helper, someone who will bring good things into the household of her children. (John 3:2-5) In Matthew's gospel, on the other hand, Jesus would be given a second chance to be with his mother. The Gospel says, ""Mary has chosen him. She has prepared for him clothes."" (3:14) Here Mary is the one who first sees Jesus in life, and she will act as his helper. This is clear in both John's and in Jesus's mother's words. John does not speak of being brought up by parents, nor does he speak or hint that Jesus was raised by his parents. Jesus said, 'You know the Father. But I have chosen you out of the beginning.' (8:29) Thus Jesus states that it is his choice to put his heart in Mary and that she must be his foster mother from the start. Note that in John there is no hint of an older brother; there are only two women in the Gospel, which means that Mary was the only woman Jesus ever cared for. [For Mary to bear Jesus another son was unthinkable. Just as Jesus had no sisters, no brothers, nothing.] Jesus himself referred to himself as 'the beloved Son' (22:36). Jesus did not create a companion for his Mother; instead, he gave her a guardian angel. Although the expression 'foster mother' is used repeatedly in Luke, Matthew uses it much more sparingly. Matthew describes Jesus as having been 'lifted up,' which would indicate that he was already a man, although we do not know exactly where Jesus grew up. Given that the two gospels say Jesus slept in a stable with Mary (19:13), it may imply that they lived together in some manner. Certainly, since Jesus told Peter to 'go and tell his disciples about the Galileans' when he found him in Cana (16:18), he must have known his followers. If Jesus stayed in Galilee and could reach his own followers, why did he leave Galileus and cross over to Samaria? It is possible that either Jesus wanted to visit his hometown and then return to Galilean disciples, or he wanted his wife's disciples to continue their missionary work in Jerusalem. Whatever the reason, once Jesus went to the city, his second coming was at hand.

Matthew and the Gospels
In these two Gethsemane Gospel Gives, we see Jesus spend some time with the disciples of his Passion Week. Not all of these disciples witnessed the arrest and crucifixion. Therefore, because there was no Jewish way of keeping the events of their lives secret, they were permitted to write down what they heard and saw in private. Many of them wrote down their words in response to their Teacher's questions and encouragement. These writings give us a glimpse of what it was like for these early Christians to live under pressure. They had to keep their faith alive, but they also had something else to strive for: to understand Jesus and to know Jesus better than any human could. As they watched Jesus die and were buried, many of those disciples who wrote their stories in their diaries never knew that their teacher died. Did they know that Judas betrayed Jesus? That there were those who rejected Jesus because of Herod Antipas's evil plan? Yes, yes, those questions are still asked today. What did Jesus say to this group of disciples? What kind of person was Jesus really? Why did the Holy Spirit reveal Jesus to these people? Was Jesus our Savior? Will Jesus return someday? And most of us will never know all the answers to all these questions. We can only try to discover God's heart for each person we meet. Our hope is that through Jesus we will become more like him, more confident, less afraid, wiser, closer to each other, especially in our relationships with our children and our friends. Love is like a vine reaching toward the sky. When its branches touch the earth, it becomes strong and healthy. Having Jesus at our side is one of life's great gifts. It enables us to connect with others in ways that are completely new. To find the source of our joy, look for Jesus."
"Deep Sleep And The Inability To Exist In Works of Fantasy In Gábriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, insomnia"," is the disease of the century in Latin America. The story follows five patients diagnosed with the affliction – a man who wakes up one day and finds himself a stranger in the land of his birth; a woman whose entire life has been spent in sleep, a girl with leprosy, who can never remember how she got there, and two women in different eras who wake up and discover themselves living in a strange society. This is an incredible novel that takes you to places you would not imagine existed – and its plot is like nothing else on the planet.

The fact that it’s written by GABRIEL GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ, author of La Llorona, El Señor de la Noche and The House of Life (among others), makes it sound impossible to be anywhere else. I have to tell you what I thought after reading it. Yes, I found myself constantly baffled by Garcías‘s brilliant imagination, his mastery of language, which brings you into a world of fantasy that makes you question if you were meant to exist. For example:
1. Who is this old woman, whose only experience of life is walking around her home in her sleep? It”s a bizarre concept.2. What kind of people does the girl living with this great grandmother think she is? At the beginning of their first meeting, we see her as a little girl, with a long hair combed over her face. But after that, she looks at things differently. Did she fall asleep and wake during the same moment?3. How does a writer who writes for children get so many ideas?4. Why does my husband say he doesn“t like books with people sleeping in them?5. In One hundred years of solitudes, how many places are there to sleep in or go to? I feel like I′m in an airplane flying all over the Earth, completely without landmarks or any idea where I am or what″re going to happen next.6. And most importantly: I don‴t understand what “invisible space‽ really means.7. Do any of these people have any relatives or other people they know who might be able to help them learn to talk again?8. All of this is extremely frustrating, because no one understands what it means to live without having anything to do. You feel you have a lot to learn, but you still don't know why your life stops.9. Does anyone care about these patients? Why isn›t this a priority? What is it about them that bothers you so much?10. Has anyone ever been to this country before? And if so, what did they think of it? They have no memories of anything like this, nor do they share the experiences of other groups of patients.11. Throughout the novel, you hear people saying things like ‹‸I don'T know...‹′ and ›‰I have heard... ‰‱. How can you not take something so positive as the existence of a doctor and a medical team and say it sounds like they don""t matter? 12. Garcia Más is one of those rare writers who knows exactly what they want to write about. Every sentence is precise and logical, making you think you're reading a novel from a specific time and place.13. A lot of critics say that Garcís‚s style is too dry. Although I often find the way he writes too serious, especially in his conversations with his mother.14. After finishing this book, my favorite quote is ‿How can I be afraid of writing?‶. It's a beautiful thing to know that I can change my mind anytime.15. Speaking of change, Garcés says he's getting ready to put a new book out, since he hasn't been able recently to figure out the right way to begin writing it!

"Anti-Aristotelian Kane If the purpose of art is, as Aristotle posited, to"," understand and to convince, then the artist's task is simply to produce works of the most refined beauty. This does not mean that the truth of a work should not be allowed for in any sense, but rather that it should be understood and believed in as a truth, not merely as beauty or eloquence, which may be aesthetically pleasing but cannot be truly attested. (On Aristotle's Critique of Poetry, vol. 2: Chapter 18, translation by A. S. Millar)

With these questions in mind it will be helpful to know a little about what I have in common with the ancient Greek philosophers and poets. In particular I am deeply indebted to my teachers and mentors at Stanford University and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The first thing to be said is that I hold no brief for any of these ancient teachers or their students. I do believe they were all excellent human beings, brilliant in their respective ways. But being a student of theirs I would be remiss in not considering what they had to say about the objects of their study. That is the topic of this essay.
PART ONE
Introduction
1
T HE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT THING ANYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE
CLASSICAL SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY AND ART
is that they taught that, like other great scientific systems, such as the natural sciences, the classical schools of philosophy and art both flourished in the fourth and fifth centuries bce. Both systems were well established by the beginning of antiquity. Their principles and methods of operation were clearly articulated and were developed throughout the course of time.



 
The ancient philosophy of Plato and Aristotle was an ancient system of thought, although it has undergone modification and transformation since the time of its origin. Plato's and Aristotelean philosophy was a form of natural science. It was concerned with questions of reality, nature, and being. For example, Plato held that only the form and its manifestations were real. He considered all phenomena to exist as they appear in our experience; but he also asserted that appearances are only names, abstractions, or symbols, used to designate what is actually present. So while Plato described his system as metaphysical, it was actually a scientific one. More important, however, is Plato’s own explanation of his doctrine of forms. Although he did not explicitly define the word, he defined the essence of being as an unchanging, unifying substance that is neither divine nor created, nor evil nor good, neither good nor bad, though all things are alike to him. Therefore he argued that all entities are composed of similar forms, each of which possesses a single, single quality or property. And yet, because there is no real separation between the forms themselves, they are all alike unto him, for he is one, having the same essence with them all. [2]
But unlike the modern philosophy, whose philosophical questions are concerned solely with what exists, ancient thought was characterized by its concern with knowing what did and did NOT exist. Ancient philosophers were concerned to investigate what was real and what really existed. Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Xenophanes, Anaximander, Pythagoras, Democritus, Eratosthenes, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, Horace, Lucretius, Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, Dante and St John of Garlia all had their own views about reality and reality itself. They rejected every form that purported to represent or describe reality. Such a view contradicted the very nature of life itself, since life was thought to consist in living in accordance with one”s physical needs, satisfying one's basic biological and physiological needs. To believe in such an existence was unthinkable. Nor was it acceptable to believe that any being is inherently good or evil. Thus, even the gods, who were considered the highest beings in all of Greek religion, were thought of as beings who merely exercised their power by creating and destroying, by virtue of some unseen, unknown force, upon their creation. Whatever the reason for creation, humans were supposed to discover and use it in order to satisfy their physical desires. However, once a human reached a certain level of sophistication, learned how to manipulate the forces of nature and think for himself, eventually he could transcend the limits of human power and learn new ways of thinking, expanding his understanding of what it means to live and die. Throughout the history of mankind, people have tried to find out the answers to these kinds of problems."
Classical and Modern Representations in O'Neill The playwright Eugene O'Neill brought many innovations to American drama.," In his 1887 ""American Dramatic Literature,"" the New York-based poet and critic Charles Eliot wrote that O'mill was ""the only truly modern dramatic artist since Shakespeare."" In fact, O'dill's plays have influenced generations of theater writers. The first of these early influences can be traced back to the earliest years of the 20th century, when playwrights like Ernest Shepard and Arthur Miller were influenced by O'llin's style, methods, and approach to writing.

O'Neal's first play at Chicago was published in 1907. It quickly became the most popular play of his year and played on Broadway five times over. His second play, A Little Night Music, debuted in 1908. This play focused on two girls from different backgrounds who both find romance in a one night stand. Although the plot was much more complex than O';Eill&#39;s first work, the actors in the play performed it flawlessly. Both of O´nels' plays were extremely successful, with the first one having a sell out run at Newberry and Broadway. These two plays remain among the top ten best selling plays of all time.The third O 'nelly play he wrote was The Great Gatsby in 1923. Like A l Little NIGHT Music this play dealt with high society and its seemingly idyllic lives. Critics compared it to James Joyce and Tolstoy. O""nelli based the dialogue for this stage version on the novel The Story of an Irishman. Not surprisingly, it lost sales even though it was one of America's most successful plays. One of several plays O`Nelly wrote while in France, The Seagull was released in Paris in 1946. Based on an actual story, this classic was a flop.As a result of their success, various American theater companies wanted to produce O `nellys other plays, including an adaptation of Moby Dick, a play based on Herman Melville&apos; Robinson Crusoe, an ode to Francis Scott Fitzgerald, called Fanciful Theatrical Fiction, which was based upon his short stories of 1920, another play about American history, Americana, based off of a novel he co-authored with his wife, Toni Morrison, produced in 1953, as well as the Pulitzer Prize winning play The Ice Man. Throughout his career, few if any of those plays or any others like them have ever been produced.In addition to being one the greatest poets in America, Eugene J.O`nelles also became one heck of talented dramatist. Many ofhis plays set new standards for theatricality. He was known for his poetic power, vivid storytelling, sophisticated and beautiful dialogue, unique staging and acting techniques. Other than being a member of Actors Fund Theater, no other theater company in existence used so many of Eugene &#8217;Es&oacute;l&iacutei.&rdquo;"
"THE LADDER: Sexuality of Ancient Greece as an instrument of social mobility Anacreon once wrote a lyric which included the lines, I"," climb down to earth and let my body be taken away from me, my mind with it. (A.V. E. Hay)

“Greece has long been the target of writers who claim that it has nothing in common with the ancient world. In fact, Athens is the most successful Greek city, culturally speaking, because it makes the Greeks more visible than any other city in Greece. The Athenian way of life and its achievements have influenced all aspects of human culture. More important than all of these things, though, is that Athens, on both religious and political terms, represents a cultural model for other cities.”(Anacreontica) – (source) “The word ‘Greek’ is actually a mythological term meaning those of a specific ethnicity or country whose origins are lost to history. This term was originally used to describe peoples who originated in western Asia Minor, southern Europe, western Africa and northern Africa. Throughout the history of the civilization, Greek people have repeatedly used this term to refer to their neighbors, who they thought were superior to them by virtue of their ethnicity. Thus, for example, when I first began to study Greek history at a university in the 1970s, the department made fun of me for saying that I went to university at Rhodes, not Athens. Many of us believed that our new Greek names were the result of having Greek ancestors and being given Greek features. We had no idea what Greek means. But now that we understand that there was a Greek tradition of writing our language, we can say with greater confidence that the expression ’Greek people‘ is simply an abbreviation of ”Hellenic—. So much of what we think of as the „Hellenisms‟ of today are the same as those found in fifth-century BC Greek literature. Not only did Hellenism emerge in Rome, but the Romans also became Hellenes.
But what does a ‚Greekness‛ really mean?
Is there a natural way to be a Hellene? What kind of Hellas is there? How is one to express oneself in such a way that one can present oneself to the outside world? When one speaks about Greekness, one usually wants to know whether one is like other people. Is there any reason to speak of one‴s own Hellos, or is it a matter of just looking at oneself and feeling how one looks and feels? And why should one want to talk about oneself? It seems that any statement that describes one's personality or personal style of being is bound to produce a false sense of self-assurance, since the truth is always different from the image one wishes to project. Our self images are our representations of ourselves in society and in our own mind. Therefore, anyone who assumes that he is Greek is setting himself up for failure. He may be able to successfully pretend to behave like a member of another ethnic group, such as a Turk or a Muslim, yet he will never be accepted as one of his own ethnic community. Consequently, he may begin to feel like an outsider and become anxious, resentful and suspicious of others. If he still tries to act Greek, others may perceive his efforts as attempts to undermine his ethnic identity. Yet, if he changes his behavior, his ethnicity is seen as something that is irrelevant and unnecessary. His self image is reinforced by his self impression, and he begins to lose his ability to communicate effectively with others.(Anacr.11.10) 1.2. Self impression is created in childhood. 2.1.

"Margery Kempe's Self-Fashioning: Visioning Herself in God The Book of Margery Kempe, considered to be the first"," self-fashioning book, was published in 1894. The self has undergone a lot of changes since then but the essence of selfhood is the same. In fact, this is one of the most profound books I have ever read about self and self love.



“When I thought of myself as a girl, I felt it; when I think of me as woman, not so much, for that makes you go a little mad. You see, my mind is only made up of ideas, and ideas of things I can never do. This is what I call my being.”

"
Learning One’s Place in the World An Analysis of the Evolution of Eve’s Understanding of Natural Patriarchy in John Milton’s Paradise Lost John Milton invokes the aide of a muse at the," beginning of his epic poem, Paradise lost, when he takes a journey across the Atlantic to seek the help of an artist in Florence. The artist sends him on a voyage through the Mediterranean Sea, which Milton describes as a “great sea of water, with many islands.... so many as the Isles of Greece and all nations;.[a] but some of these islands are as large as isles of Norway.” In Paradise we learn that God has created the earth and its people. This includes Eve who is created in God‘s image, as well as Adam, who will be a sign for future generations and a leader of people living in paradise. In order for Milton to communicate with this artist, Milton requires the Muse to be able to speak with the poet and to understand what Milton is trying to say. Therefore, the poem begins by asking us to think of ways in which our minds can be used to express God.

Milton is the first of several artists to play a similar role in Paradise. Other artists have followed, such as Lucretius (Paradise Regained) in Book I of Virgil‟s Aeneid, Dante and Donatello in Virgilian poetry, Petrarch and Tasso in Latin poetry. Many other Renaissance and early modern artworks are known to quote or employ Milton and other major literary sources, although they are still considered relatively anonymous. Even so, those Renaissance painters and sculptors who incorporated Milton into their works are often called „Muse“ artists because they were the ones who actually invented the role of being in Eden with Adam and Eve.


A Muse in Heaven The world of Milton does not start in heaven, though it does end there, but instead begins in an actual garden named paradise, where the Divine Muses live and work. Paradise is an ancient name for the Garden of Eden, a spot where people went to meet with God in order to worship him. Milton took this place very seriously and designed the garden in such a way that it would be completely like heaven. He also included the phrase ‚where from out of all the Earth‛ in each page, suggesting that the muses of heaven could speak directly with him and tell him what to write in his book of poetry—something that he would not be allowed to do. Both of those features are associated with Paradise as it has been described in literature and in many paintings. While Milton lived, many books were written about the history of Paradise and the origin of its musics. One of them, called Milton, was published in 1674. It is a book that contains a commentary on Paradise by three poets, Horatio Spenser, Edward Young, and Sir Philip Sidney. That book was compiled by Robert Dodsley, whose work was popular among readers of English translations of classical literature. Sidney‒Sylvanus and Horace also wrote commentaries on the Milton story. Throughout Europe, scholars were interested in finding any information about Paradise available. Some of their efforts resulted in some great discoveries. Just as Milton explored the land of paradise for his musically inspired story, astronomers used the same approach to chart the course of heavenly bodies. They tried to figure out the most accurate way to predict the positions of celestial objects. Since every celestial body has an orbit around the sun, they decided to look for a star system that would align perfectly with that orbit. Although this is only one method of identifying stars, it is one of today‖s most successful. There are other ways to determine the position of stars and planets, however. For example, scientists use the Doppler effect, an increase in apparent speed due to a relative motion between the source and receiver. By using a laser to send a signal back and forth over a long distance, you can determine just how much the object moves relative to you. With the recent launch of NASA‌s New Horizons spacecraft, we can find out more about what it will take to get there. Did you know New Horizon s exact mission is to study Pluto? That‱s right! The spacecraft※s name is derived from a Greek phrase that means ›pluto‴, meaning ‹the bull›. (See the ‰Greek for ′or‷). It was discovered in 1989 by two space buffs named William Draper and Wally Schirra, both members of Lowell Observatory. Lowell is dedicated to finding and studying minor planets and comets, especially those that come from outer space. Prior to this, no one had really thought about Pluto, until astronomers in France and Spain started to discover these strange bodies in 1979 and 1980, respectively. When Draper suggested"
"Charity in the Character of Sir William Thornhill In the novel, The Vicar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith,"," there is a chapter where a man named Mr. Stokes is killed on the way to the execution of his sentence. The plot develops around the death of a fellow clergyman who is trying to prevent his brother from following his example and killing the hangman. This is the only example of charity in Sir Will's character, and he is particularly good at it. (1) This does however seem to contradict that which he says in an earlier scene when he goes out to visit Sir Rowland Hill's wife and expresses his regret that he will never have the chance to meet her again: ""My dear madam,"" he said, ""how sorry I am to hear that you have been such an object of envy to me, for my own heart has long lain awake at nights thinking of you."" (3) However, in all honesty, I can't say I feel anything like regret for his having been so cruel towards his wife.

With Magic Comes Power: Exploring Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and Shakespeare’s The Tempest When an individual reads Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta," (c.1590), the first thing they think of is the Jew. But what if you could get to know another human being in the same way, for example, that I do? What if, instead of thinking of a doctor as a stereotypical white male, you were instead to think about Marcellus Wallace or Elizabeth Barrett Browning or even Thomas Wyatt or Thomas Morley as your character in your novel?

As a writer, I often find that when I go into my research, with the intent of creating a story, my first inclination is to write characters who are as different as possible from my own. This is especially true of characters that would be out of place in fiction. In other words, writers want to find out who they are. The problem is that it‘s hard to tell someone from another. Our imagination can sometimes make us believe that our friends or our enemies look very similar, but they may not, because they“look alike” in different ways. Marry your neighbors! The best way to test how much you love or loathe a person is by examining their personalities. You may discover that you have a lot in common with them, or you may become bored with people that don‟t make you happy. (In fact, Marley and Marigold are both named after Irish women.)
It is interesting to me, however, to discover how little some writers know about the real world. Just because the writer is trying to be different, does not mean that they should be. I suspect that this is one reason why writers are so quick to quote Dickens or Chaucer, who wrote stories that are completely different from their real-life counterparts, when they happen to mention those authors‚Äô works in their stories. Many writers feel that, since they only know the fictional work of their idols, they need to put it in context. That is simply not true. Not all fictional works are equal. Some of these works, such as Ulysses, are meant to inspire awe. Other works can be downright offensive. And yet, others are truly wonderful, and are fully as important to our literary lives as the Bible.
The problem begins when we start thinking about fiction like we think we know our actual world; that is, we begin to miss the forest for the trees. We forget that fiction is not reality, nor is it the truth. Fiction is created by writers who want something different than our own selves, something we never knew. Therefore, let‌ís not forget to open our minds to the possibilities of fiction, including literature.

Female Bonding in Roxana The bond between Roxana and Amy is not a standard," ""normal"" couple. But after a long courtship, they begin to bond over a shared love of music. In fact, Roxane and Emily (and later Amy) enjoy singing together. The couple have a lot of fun with the idea of starting a band together!

But when their relationship starts to fail, things get really awkward. Finally, when Amy has had enough and decides that it’s time to leave Roxanah, Amy‘s departure is one of the most bitter endings of all of their stories. This bittersweet story is about more than a girl leaving her boyfriend. It“truly” is “about a relationship„—between two women.‡
A romantic comedy, You‟re My Everything is the third and final season of „the best teen teenage‱girl movie‚ ever‹.
Season three focuses on Roxanne, who is struggling with her relationship with Amy and wants to be happy. She tries to win back the friendship that she lost with Roxanna, but the two girls have an uneasy friendship. Roxie and Roxann are trying to understand each other and learn from each others‌ missteps.The show also introduces some new characters:‍Mitch, a cute guy who‴s just getting into high school, and Dean, an older boy that wants only to impress Roxena. Mitch is also a senior and a member of a sorority, so he″s definitely ready for college. Although he has a crush on her, Dean is very shy and nervous around her. There are also several memorable cameos, such as the hilarious duo from The Breakfast Club (Bobby and Jerry from the hit TV show), the preppy Mr. Jones (Randy Quaid from Mad Men), a hot-headed J.T. from 90210 (John Turturro from Arrested Development), and one young lady from a high-school production of Guys And Dolls (Peyton Liston).
It was co-created by Jon Cassar and Jessica D. Williams, both of whom are known for writing teen dramas. Cassarin and Williams were also the creators of HBO's Girls. Their first two seasons were written and produced by Tim Kring, whose first writing job was as writer/executive producer for American Horror Story: Asylum and its sequel, American Psycho. Both episodes of Girls were produced and directed by executive producers Jonathan Tropper, Sam Rockwell, Simon Baker and Rachel Bay Jones. Girls was released in February 2010 and finished airing on April 1, 2010. After its release, Girls became oneof the top five highest grossing cable network shows of 2008 and 2009. According to Nielsen Media Research, the fourth season earned a 3.2 rating among the teens 18–24, beating out the season three premiere with a 2.0 rating. Season four was seen by 7.5 million households and was watched by 8.3 million viewers. A fifth season premiered in January 2011, with season five being set to air in November 2012. With the success of its third season, HBO decided to order the rest of Season 4.

"The Purgatory of the Postmodern Character and Action in Beckett’s “Godot” and “Endgame” ""That God does not exist, I cannot deny. That my"," life could be a vain dream — if God were to exist. But how could you say that, when we know that God is simply not there?""

I can only say 'the effort has not been in vain.'

A.S. Mill
(from God's Gift, The Complete Novel, (1923) [written in 1922])
My Dear Friends,
It is a pleasure to be able to tell you that I am well and nearly ready to start work on another of my novels. In fact, now that my health is somewhat better, my appetite for writing is greatly enhanced, for I enjoy the novel so much that almost any subject seems interesting at times. Although I must confess that as a boy I was a little given to writing about anything but serious topics.
Novels have been my chief delight ever since I first read Conrad and then myself, though I used to read in English for fun, because I thought that would help me to understand what I should want to say. As I grew older I became interested in serious subjects, but until now I never felt able or willing to tackle a serious novel. This is the reason why I feel a strong desire to begin writing again. If I could only get into some kind of a routine, perhaps I would be spared many hours of solitude. Perhaps I may be allowed to stick to serious study for a year or two. Anyway, such a thing would probably give me more time to work, so please excuse my eagerness to get back into the habit of writing. Having said that...
1. Please forgive me for saying so many things I wish to keep to myself. Writing a novel is like talking to someone who is deaf. Whenever I mention a name, word or phrase, the person I address nods and agrees to talk about the topic. Many of these things are still true of me even now, although I seem to have forgotten them completely. So please don't be surprised if you hear me ask you to do something I'm not up to doing. (I think that's why my writing has become rather difficult.)
2. Now, about those two subjects you mentioned, namely, ""God"" and ""the church."" Do you know whether I meant that in terms of being God or in regards to being in a particular church? Well, let me try to explain. When I write about religion, it is only in order to express my opinion. You may object that this is wrong, since everyone is free to believe as he or she wants, or may not care to know the truth, especially since the church is constantly under attack. Well...that is true, yes, certainly. Still, speaking of freedom, isn't there really such an important thing as the freedom to choose? And if we are going to speak of choosing, shouldn't we also speak about believing? Of course, you see, this line of argumentation is circular. It is neither possible nor justified to infer from the fact that one is in favor of religion that either one believes in God, nor is it possible to prove that anyone who does believe in such things is actually a member of his or her own church. Both of us are free people. We can go to Hell without knowing it! But we can also choose to go there, if that is what we want. Oh, dear me! I know it sounds silly, coming from a writer, yet it occurs to me that all this might be helpful in trying to figure out the meaning of certain things. For example, doesn't it occur to you, as you consider my book and its author, how much the choice of your book has contributed to making me look at things differently? Isn't that true? Aren't you afraid that if people continue to make such choices, their minds will be attracted to the kinder side of their faith? Why, then, donâ€™t you think it would stand to reason that you would have a harder time of it?
3. Regarding your question concerning the existence of God: I think you are mistaken in your idea that there is something about God that makes him real. Certainly, there are things about him that make him non-existent, like the idea of omniscience, etc., but the point of view from which"
"Cúchulainn’s Women, Loki’s Children Power & Femininity in Two Mythic Figures The Nordic figure of Loki and the Celtic figure of"," CúChulainsna are often placed on opposite sides of the same coin. Both are characters that give us a hint of their relationship to our world. Loki is the most powerful god in Norse mythology, although we never really know much about him. He has the power to bend nature and to turn things to his will. In some ways he‘s like Nature itself, and in others like Zeus himself. This is one of those stories that is best understood if you begin with Loki as a man. Lothbrok, who was Loki”s father, ruled Asgard as king. However, Lohbroks wife and son were killed when Loki was only 2 years old. The gods banished his mother from Asgard and gave her one year to wander through the Earth. She was given a name and a place by which to live. They called her Cáchachulan. (In fact, CÚCHULAINNA is an ancient feminine name for her.) Loki grew up in her home and it was at Cánacht that his powers were first developed. Although he was very much a monster, he began to change in his power and appearance over the years. His transformation into Loki began with his conception. At the moment of conception, his belly was flat and red, suggesting a mixture of blood and semen. Throughout his life, however, it has been his skin color that has changed. Initially, when we see Cunhgail and Loki together in Finnian mythology they appear as different individuals. But after Loki matured he turned into what we call Lórunn in Grettis saga, son of Odin. Cunnhghail was no more than a boy when she conceived Lollór. When Cuntgill was born, her body was a full-grown woman, having assumed the form of a goddess. We can see this in several of his names, such as Ulla, Hálfdán and Eðgíla. Other than being a half-woman, each one was capable of great physical strength. Eithgils (she who is “the woman of war“) is called ‘The strong-minded and powerful goddess who takes a strong lead among the men, because she holds a sharp sword and wields it with the skill of an expert warrior‛. It seems that CUNHGILL was the only woman in all of Europe who could match up to Loki. As long as she remained a child, the two would not have been as close as they eventually became. Not only did Loki become the father of Eithel the blacksmith and Cnut, but he also became father to many others as well. All of these people were the children of other women. Their mother‟s names were usually not known to us. For example we know Eiríkr and Frigg that were Cunts. And though we don„t know the names of some of them, we do know that it wouldn′re better to be cautious about naming children after the gods, since they may end up being their parents. So there was one woman who gave rise to so many offspring that the history of Iceland is replete with them. Many of us know our mothers and grandmothers, so we can say that I have a sense of what it must have felt like to meet your mother for the first time. I can tell you that she was beautiful and that every woman is beautiful to me. That was my mother. [Loki is actually a composite figure. There are other people involved in the creation of him, including Agave, Surt and Anu. Suttung, whose name means „the sky‖, is a female character in Norwegian folklore. Nils S. Gunnarsson, a Norwegian author of children‡of myth, wrote that SUTTUNG was ‌not a human being but an entity created by herself. Therefore, no human can truly understand what she is like•, according to this writer]. It is sometimes said that Einherjar was created out of ‹Einn› and ※Éinn». While the majority of people agree that these two names belong to Einn, Eind and Inheir, they argue that they should be used together. Others believe that ’Eind (Inheirdr) should be read as the ‭Ihinn d‽ (‬‫‰  the ‬I‱) of‭ ‴‹. If we keep the reading of hinn as æinn or ihti, then Einsetung should"
"This Man Loved Earth, Not Heaven, Enough to Die Death, Imagination, and Reality in Wallace Stevens’ The Man with the Blue Guitar ""We are born to die."" —SHAKESPEARE, Romeo and Juliet Wallace"," W. Stevens, the most original American poet since Emily Dickinson, wrote The Woman in White as a companion piece to his most widely read poem The Circus (1852) and to another of his greatest poems (The Rake), a novel in verse, The Woodlanders (1907). Stevens had no interest in poetry when composing these two poems, though, but he was willing to let them speak for themselves. This is the poem that made the front cover of the 1922 Broadway play Romeo! and which was perhaps the last great American song ever written:

I have been to the sea; I have seen land. / But now I go to see my friends— / To find out who I am and why I sing.
In the garden all is green, / Under the trees all are red, // And flowers on the ground / Are like diamonds. In the streets / Is all activity; / On all sides the noise of life. // The world is wide, it is good, & there / Life is sweet. The children are laughing / While I sit alone, half-starved, lonely. … / The music of love is in my heart, … // My heart beats for you and for your love.…
A voice so sweet can break the spell / Of all the sadness of a world. —ROBERT SAINTSBLOOD
But this is not the only poem of which Stevens has been the subject. He may have written over forty. Many of these poems are lost, except for fragments, until they are finally rediscovered by his students, who hold them in deep reverence. Almost all were first published in magazine forms, such as the New Criterion or Poetry, or in book form, including “The Woodlander” and The Waste Land. All are still important. Indeed, Stevens does not seem to have left many traces of himself after his death. His poems appear in all collections. More than a half million copies have survived. Only a few of Stevens's poems have become classics. But how many will survive the test of time? That is a question of much importance to poets today."
"Rejecting Colonial Memory It is clear that a collective historical memory, which in"," itself is bound to be a form of denial, cannot be maintained if it does not reflect history at all. This article examines the history of black resistance to slavery, in particular the antislavery and radical Reconstruction movements, with a specific regard to their relationship to European imperialism. The colonial memory of slaveholders and colonial administrators was seen as a justification for racism, repression and genocide against Africa and its people. In the context of a largely Euro-American culture of racial capitalism, such an approach could also justify colonial violence against African peoples, often in the name of combating ""racial interlopers"".

A critical discourse on colonialism is thus required, not only to understand how racism has defined the way in which black people have been viewed in history, but also what it has done to African people's consciousness about themselves and their past. Taking the black radical tradition as an example, the essay below explores how European colonialism has had a powerful effect on the ways in both Africans and Africans have viewed themselves, their history and the African diaspora.
It is important to recognise that colonialism did not create a linear history; rather, colonialism brought together the different parts of Africa’s history into one, and in so doing, shaped them individually. It created the basis for the modern idea of separate nations, bringing together different groups of people who were perceived as different, for example in terms of language, religion, ethnicities, languages or customs. Through colonialism, Africans were forced to reconcile their own histories and lifestyles with the cultures of other groups. Therefore, there was a continuous and complex process of reconciliation. However, when Africans do view themselves through this lens, they perceive their lives as part of the same larger project. Their sense of being different from other Africans is seen through the lenses of their shared history with others and a shared concept of oppression. Thus, while they maintain a sense that they are different – and that their roots go back to other peoples of African descent – they still acknowledge that the majority of Africans today are the descendants of Europeans, or other members of European societies. Although they experience a lot of discomfort within their communities, African Africans still see themselves as equal members. They are able to point to this equality and claim it is based on their understanding of themselves: I am not part Negro but instead, my ancestors are. (Bukharin, 1996).
The essay argues that, although African history is one long story of war, slavery and oppression, it can never be told in a one-sided manner. Instead, a historical narrative needs to account for how Africans understood their self-identity throughout their development. Colonial memory is a common feature of much modern literature, films and television programmes. History, therefore, needs a way of speaking about history that includes a recognition that it involves multiple perspectives and points of view. Ultimately, this is the key to understanding why colonialism exists. Without acknowledging the multitude of perspectives, we risk losing the ability to unpack the complexities of issues, because we cannot see a whole truth in any one perspective. Not only is there a complicated history to speak about, since it requires us to accept the existence of multiple histories, each with their respective strengths, weaknesses and contradictions, no less so is it the case that individual viewpoints do not add up to a single picture of reality. To find the truth, one must consider the many sides of an issue. One must also consider that not all viewpoints are equally valid, especially when we are dealing with subjects whose lived experiences are difficult to fully comprehend. Both of these requirements mean that historians need to keep an open mind about what they say. Embracing a multiplicity of viewpoints means that we can appreciate that our interpretations are not the only ones that are valid. Our interpretations need not be accepted as the most accurate of all, nor those that would be considered the “correct” interpretation of certain issues. We need also to question whether our own interpretations of history are truly valid and meaningful, even if they appear to support a certain viewpoint. If we do make these assumptions, then we lose our ability properly to know the complexity of events and to produce meaning from our historical analyses. As a result, scholars need develop a set of skills that allow them to look at historical issues from a variety of vantage points and perspectives. Many of us believe that having the knowledge and skills to do this will contribute towards a greater ability in our work. At the heart of this process is developing a ‘perspective‘. A perspective is not a view, merely something that appears to correspond to some information. Rather, someone holds a perspective on something, understands what that something is and seeks to make sense out of it. Having a strong perspective can help us identify aspects of life that may otherwise go unnoticed, as well as reveal new aspects to explore. Given this, let me suggest that learning to develop"
"Deborah and the Degradation of Israel Throughout the Book of Judges, women play a significant role"," in the narrative. In fact, when we think of a “woman” in a specific context, such as the temple, temple prostitutes, or in God’s house, the Hebrew word for ‘woman,‘ is translated as ’-davah. This word has several different meanings, including ”mistress, slave, concubine, prostitute, widow, virgo, and harlot“. The word literally describes a human being who has sexual relations with another human that is not intended by God for any benefit or pleasure to the one doing the act.

Judges Chapter 4:1-16
Summary: God has told Moses to tell the women in Israel to be fruitful and multiply, because they have no knowledge. Many of them have become like harlots, living in luxury and possessing enormous amounts of wealth. Through their continual sin, they are being shown the degradation of their bodies and their sexuality. As they sin against God, their lives become even worse. (Biblical Text)
(1) Moses tells all the priests that the land that God gives them to inherit will be theirs. Some of these priestly leaders are jealous of the power of God and seek to have the priesthood changed so they may take the inheritance. They have promised to each one of us that we will receive the same inheritance that our father and mother received. God reminds them of what they promised; they cannot keep it. So, God sends them away from Israel, until He gives the rest of His people the blessing of life. [2]

"Carwin and the Imp: Perversity and Atmosphere in Wieland In one of his famous short stories, Edgar Allen Poe","'s ""The Gold Rush,"" W.B. Yeats wrote, ""Our hearts are too full of impossibilities to be able to express what they feel.""

No one has ever managed to fully capture Yeates' idea. The best way to understand Yeatoes' impossibly vast ambition is to see it in terms of its cultural context. In Yeaters' own day, the United States was a nation obsessed with making the most of a limited imagination. American writers worked hard to create the kind of literary material that would lend itself to their own fantasies. Through these writers, America acquired its literary mythos, its myths of good and evil, hope and despair.
A few writers created the myth of the natural and God-given. This was the story that Americans wanted to tell themselves. But others created this myth out of their imaginings, out from the raw material of reality. Not only did these stories come into being through the work of writers who were themselves natural-born impresarios—not like Yeater (who was an Irishman), but like Whitman, Hemingway, Auden, T.S. Elliot, Sylvia Plath, Ezra Pound, Emily Dickinson, or Elizabeth Bishop—but through writers as different as the two writers of Shakespeare's sonnets, Thomas Hardy and Virginia Woolf. To many Americans, these impostors were the equivalent of an artist's paintbrush, not the only way in which America's reading culture was imagined. For example, in 1894 the British novelist George Meredith introduced America to the so-called ""American School"" of poetry. Like Yeateaters, Meredith was himself an impromptu genius. Meredith's poems appeared in several American magazines and journals, though some critics complained that his verse was too prosaic for American taste. His poems are filled with the same kind self-consciously down-to-earth commonplaces that, for example in Meredith, were so prominent in Yeaters' works. Indeed, when the poet H.D. puts into a long poem her ""exceptionally beautiful"" father, she does so as a parody of Yeating's own literary ambitions. Hilda Doolittle, who wrote the poem, called Meredith ""the greatest original of our times."" Even though the poems in American poetry were usually addressed to someone other than Hildy herself, Haddie Dolan, whose poems of selfless devotion he published in 1909, thought them ""so much greater than anything I have ever written."" Doles reminds us that Meredith made his name as an ""original"" in poetry, and that he also became known as ""Haddies"" or ""Eddie"" Meredith. Certainly, American poets have influenced American fiction, such as Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize winner Eudora Welty, but the influence can go both ways. Williams got his start in writing poetry directly inspired by his mother. As young adults, Williams and his older sister Laura worked on her mother's typewriter in the kitchen while they waited for her to return to work. ""There was no thought of being an author,"" Laura remembers. Her sisters took over the typewriting, adding to Williams's poetic output. He wrote his first poems at age twelve and then turned to writing fiction. Writing a novel helped him discover his love for his brother. Both of them graduated high school, although Williams did not graduate high enough to qualify for a full scholarship. Consequently, he joined his younger sister's school at 16 and left for college. Although he earned a scholarship to Stanford University, his studies there ended when his family needed the funds to send him back to England, where he remained for three years. During his stay in England he began writing about his childhood and family. Finally, at 21, having earned enough money to support himself and a large family, William returned to America. Here he found a second chance to write. Ironically, because he had left the education system in favor of writing, eventually becoming an independent writer, Edwardian America still had no literary tradition. Throughout his life, especially during his last two decades, literature had been dominated by writers like Poe, Longfellow, Hawthorne, Whittier, Conrad, O'Neill, Eliot, Shaw, Thackeray, Hardy, Stevenson, Austen; but not even these had the power to move Americans as strongly as Meredith and Yeatusheets had. By the time of William Meredith we have a society that is obsessed not just with literary greatness but also with imputations of greatness, with heroes and villains. These imputationary figures are as powerful as those born out physical strength. They are impure and obscene and alluring, as they are the objects of fantasy. Of course, Yeation's impudence is more complicated than a man who imagines himself a"
Self Destruction in Kindred Self mutilation and self destruction serve many roles in Octavia,". Self-mutilation, for example, can occur to satisfy a need or desire, or in response to physical or psychological abuse. Physical abuse can be directed toward the target's mental or physical faculties. Psychological abuse, on the other hand, involves harm to the psyche, often by physical means. The word Self also serves as the title of a range of novels and poems in the same vein, including _Sister Carrie_, _Self Mutilation of an Alien, Mother of Blood_, _A Mother and Son_ (written in 1848), _The Nihilist and His Friend_ and _Nihilists_.

The practice of Self Mutilations has long been common in modern-day society; there have been at least twenty Self Murdering murders in fiction so far, with a death toll of over 1,000. In fact, such cases have become more frequent as society becomes more tolerant, especially in larger cities. This is one reason why the phenomenon of the Nannies, Mothers, Sisters, Fathers, Grandmothers, Grandsons and Great-Grandparents, is so pervasive. Throughout Western Civilization, there are always more children living in families with multiple generations of people. Many of these older generations have an attachment to their mothers and grandmothers and to these caring figures that never leaves them. Although it may seem odd to some, the desire to have a mother/grandmother/great-grandparent is a common feature of society. Nanny, nanny! It is the mother's job to support her children and keep them alive, not the son's or daughter's. Therefore, when we see a Mother, a Grandparent, anyone who cares for someone, we should remember that these people have cared for us and our children. Our attachment must be understood, because they understand our attachment.

 _Galician Women Travel on Their Own Without Being Stopped_
2
Galicia, Spain, once had the most important ports in Europe. Not just any ports. They were the ones that kept ships from going all over Spain and Europe, preventing piracy. Now, those ports are the big problem, but Galicia still has the third-largest fleet of merchant ships. If the government wants to prevent piracy, they need to stop those Galician merchants. And they think they can solve this problem by stopping those ships' voyages. But the Galicians are getting frustrated. Some of their captains are complaining that they cannot get past Spain's walls and that it takes too long to unload the cargo. So they send out their own sailors to do the job. There are also stories of Galiña men and women who want to travel to America, France, Holland, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, Turkey, and all the way to New Zealand. These Galians are coming to know the sea, no matter how much it makes them sick. It seems that there is no stopping these travels. Maybe that's because there really isn't any stopping to be had. Every ship is leaving, taking the risk of being caught and being shot down by pirates. More than a few ships are lost each year. Galiza is getting restless. Even the cities that claim to care about piracy are letting them go. One of those cities is Palaeque. Paleche is actually a town that has been growing rapidly lately. You can find people working in Palacios. Other than Palaqueco and Palaecuego, Paloeque is probably the only place where you can really feel safe. Most of its population is not Galish, although they do make up a large percentage of Palaque. To make matters even worse, several Galícia towns are being built to replace Palque and the towns that surround them, which is causing even greater anxiety.

"Illustrations in Persepolis When I first flipped through Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, I was"," floored by the book and its incredible photography. The lush, colorless images, packed with such an exquisite sense of time, detail, and composition, were so striking and evocative, that I felt drawn to know more about her. I have been captivated by her work since I read the manuscript, when I received a call from a friend who asked me to visit an exhibition in Tehran. This is one of my favorite pieces from the exhibit, because I feel like we are talking about Marjan‘s style, not just one individual photograph (she shot hundreds!).

The exhibit opens May 25th and features the largest collection of Marjamen Satrpyat” photographs ever assembled. Marjaan Satropi was one among the most talented Iranian photographers in the last decades, with her works focusing on her identity as a woman, as well as the history of Iran during the period of Shah Reza Pahlavi“s reign. In Marji„s photos, she creates portraits of people that she meets in different places and focuses on what they look like, instead of just depicting the objects they are holding.
In addition to this, you can find MarJaans prints for sale in both online stores and at art shops in New York, London, Berlin and Paris. Please visit her website here. Find out more information about the exhibition. More…

It will feature the collection which includes 8,000 photographs, including many she took while traveling to India.

The Central Message of Chaucer’s Retraction The length and the abstractness of Chaucer’s Retractioncan be deceiving,"ly perceived as a ‘short letter” but the point of view is that of a long letter – the “two letters“. The first two lines are quite ordinary and un-Chaucerian. This is the beginning of the letter in its original state:

1. I have heard my Master‟s words.2. Come, you who love to talk, let me read the long letters;3. Let me write them by myself with the space between the lines4. Not like these things, for these are the only ones I know well5.

It will not be easy to write these letters from without—yet I will do it.11. If I do not write this letter it does not matter much,12. But if I write it, then I shall not forget it13.

“We were so happy that we couldn’t drive across the state to see our brother, because he was dead,″ says Jacquie. ″We thought the only reason would be if we never got home.′
But it worked out for us. In 2016, Jacquieson and her children are celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary. This weekend, she will turn 71, and this year, celebrate with the kids. She also took a trip to Paris with her daughter Caroline, which Jacquintoskis attended, on Saturday. Caroline was 12 years old at the time. Both of them did not grow up with a mother like Jacquietis, living in a house with two children. But after being raised by two very loving parents, they loved life and were quite confident that they could handle anything.


It was a typical teenage experience: they went to parties and clubs and concerts, but they always felt a sense of independence, something to be proud of. They never felt pressure to prove themselves. No matter what they did, no matter how much they studied or how many hours they worked or what role they played, when they got older, those things would just fade into the background. And they never forgot what it felt like to have a parent beside you every step of your life. That was just part of life, though, not the whole of it. There was always someone in your corner, someone standing by your side, holding your hand, giving you strength. Just as there was in Jacquia's childhood, there has always been someone waiting for you inside your own life.""
With the recent release of their new movie, Michelle and Hilry's ""White Christmas"", the duo recently took time off to film a documentary for The New School about Jacquiretta Kennedy O'Sallettin's life - a life that ended tragically before she was born. Jackie O's(b 1933) father and mother were murdered during the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaving her with an orphaned mother and a nameless half-brother, with whom she remained close throughout her childhood and teen years. Jacquirria was raised in Miami and was educated in private schools, attending high school at Florida State University where she excelled in both academics and extracurriculars. However, upon graduation, her plans for college and career shifted to Baltimore, Maryland, taking her to the big leagues of professional athletics, eventually finding a spot in the National Basketball Association, playing for the Boston Celtics, where her talents helped elevate her draft status. Shortly after she signed a 10-year, $70 million contract to play with Boston, Jackie suffered an aneurysm, forcing her retirement from the game, although she returned to manage the team until her death from cancer in January, 1994. Her memory was revered by the Celtics' fans, especially in Boston's Fanbase, often receiving over 500,000 visits per year. Throughout her career, the most significant moment was when she served as the face of an annual 'Jackie O Day', a day devoted to honoring her memory. Although her health declined rapidly through the last year of treatment, once she died, fans all over the world mourned her loss. As a tribute to Jackie, a statue of a large basketball with flowers was unveiled in Washington, D.C. on December 26, 2004. It was made by artist Keith Rheiser. He said, ""In honor of Jackie's passion for life its worth remembering her as a pioneer in women's sports and cultural contributions to America. Having grown up in Baltimore and visited her in person, my personal appreciation for her dedication to education and achievements in life has grown tremendously over time."" For her contribution to basketball and the women in sports, Governor Jay Nixon presented Jacquira Kennedy with his Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 20, 2007, in honorific of having won the Women's NBA Championship with Team USA in 1991. Also, for helping Jackie to inspire others, Princess Anne took part in an 8-week marathon of 50 miles across England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Princess Diana also joined Jacquiri Kennedy in saying a final goodbye"
Autoethnography My eyes shifted between a copy of Austen's Pride and," Prejudice (1868), the British edition of Henry Fielding's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1904), a pamphlet on Victorian women's rights written in response to Harriet Taylor, and the novel A Room with Many Doors, written by David Hare and first published in 1894. In all three, Austens heroine, Miss Bates, is seen as the embodiment of the modern female self, but unlike the other novels, she is neither the most intelligent nor the prettiest of her sex. The other characters are, on the one hand, the stereotypical middle-class English family and its supposed moral failings; on another, they are the kind of characters who are good for the story. Hare's Aroom has an interesting history: he wrote it in February 1887, when he was already working on The History of Mr Polly Peachum (first published that June). This was not the only novel he had completed in the previous year. He had also begun a second, much shorter one, called Mrs Doubtfire (published in April 1888), and this too was published the same month. Although the two were planned as part of a trilogy, Hare decided to produce them separately, partly in order to write them more quickly. Both were successful, though not so well known as A room with many doors. This is the third of these novels to be collected together in book form, with the others being A Door in England (1900), The House at Pooh Corner (1 December 1901), A Story of Love and Death (December 1904). I have chosen to combine them because they share many similarities in character and style, although there are also obvious differences. A different kind

of writing? What sort? This can sometimes happen to me, particularly when I am writing fiction. At other times, I feel entirely at home with my own style. But recently, something seemed to go wrong with this process. Writing a novel always starts with a strong, clear idea. Then comes the act of writing, which tends to move into a state of crisis. I know the moment when this happens because it does, especially in fiction, once or twice a week. Suddenly, you think ""There must be a mistake!"" Or ""What happened?"" Then the truth comes out, like a black hole. It is only a matter of time before you realize what you've done. And yet, often, reading a book is like this, too. Not every word is right, not every sentence is perfect, even when you're doing it pretty well. Occasionally, sentences stray from their path and collide with each other, no longer understanding why they veered off into such an unexpected course. Yet, if you are trying to tell a story, maybe the plot is your best weapon. You can't always avoid this danger. Every line, every paragraph, represents a page of your book. Anywhere you put it down becomes a blank space, a hole in your life.
CHAPTER ONE
My dear husband,
I am still very much in love with you, dear as you were when we married, four years ago. Please forgive my keeping you waiting. We had to postpone our meeting until tomorrow, because there was a doctor to visit us. Fortunately, he is a nice man and did not scold us severely. However, since he asked us how we liked our new home, we should probably give some details about it. First of all, it is on two floors. There are five bedrooms, each one furnished in accordance with his fancy. They are as follows: one large sitting room, one small bedroom, two small bedrooms with bathrooms, bathroom, kitchen, dining room and a large kitchen. Altogether, there is one whole floor. Our apartment is huge. Therefore, let me introduce you to everyone. Darling husband! Please come closer to my ear. Oh! I could hardly hear myself speak. Do you see my little foot? That is my husband. My dear little one! All alone here, quite alone! Well, now that I look back, perhaps I should explain something. Actually, my wife and I live quite happily in this apartment. As long as I do not take the stairs, everything goes swimmingly. Everyone is pleased with me and wants to know me. Especially the servants. Just as soon as they see me coming, then they say ""Well, what are you up to?"" ""We will have a little chat with Mrs B.,"" I reply. ""Oh! Yes, yes, Mrs F.,"" they all agree. Now, about the staircase. When I came to this country a few years back and brought my parents with us, our house was very small and small people were still unable to understand what it was that we needed. So I thought I'd make my old parents comfortable and give them some money and then bring them to our beautiful house. Here they stay"
Suomi The must of the old farmhouse seared my nostrils with," the stench.
“Is this place haunted?” I asked. “Perhaps.’‌‪‘The house is haunted,  I told him. But the answer he gave was that it was just a house and that there was no need to be afraid. This soothed me as I continued on my way toward the store. The food was good, although I did not take the bread with me because I had no appetite for it. I took a gourd full of water from a tank outside the house. It was then that I realized that the water I drank wasn‟t water but blood. A long, thin stream of blood poured out of a large wound on the front of my right shoulder. Blood seemed to flow through my veins as it dripped into the gutter. In the dim light of night, I could barely see my hand in front or in the darkness behind me. Suddenly, my vision focused on something red. Although I felt like I was being watched, someone suddenly grabbed me from behind and yanked me back. Someone who had blood dripping from her hands. She pointed a finger at my face. Slowly, she pulled me close to her. Just as she reached around to pull my hair out, something black fell from above me and landed on her head. And I thought the sky would be dark and then I heard something move and something else hit my head, and I opened my eyes and sat up. As I looked at what had fallen from the roof, a man was kneeling beside me, holding a gun in both hands and a bloodied handkerchief in his other hand. He was pointing the barrel of his weapon at me when I turned to look at him; I couldn„t make myself do it, so I let the blood drip from my neck. When I finally raised my gaze to him, he was looking at the black stain on one of its shoulders. His eyes widened when he saw the two-foot-long cut on top of me.""‬‹

Amber Lane (1904–1994)
It was raining, but the rain kept a bit more than a foot of rain coming down. People were standing around the pool, soaking wet. One of them was on fire, which was how I knew he got there. There were two men, though, one a heavyset man, the other a thin youngish woman, both of whom were looking down at a body lying in pools of their own blood.
I walked up to the one who was already on his feet. ""How many have you killed?"" I demanded. Not knowing why I'd asked, since I doubted there'd been any violence, his answer was simply: ""Two,"" he said. Oh, yes, two. Yeah, yeah. Two. Did you think he really meant it? Did those two mean that he hadn't killed any of us? That he wouldn't kill us all? Or that we should blame him? Was that what they had in mind?
My companion didn't answer, nor did he ask me any questions. Maybe he assumed I spoke only Japanese. At least I hope so. Anyhow, now that three were dead, maybe he thought he could get away with saying it twice. So I guessed I better tell him about what I know—which is that every time we've tried to kill him — he's managed to run away. What else could I do? I suppose that's the part that made me feel bad, because even now I can remember how terrified I used to feel when we first attacked him and his brother, who ran away after we killed all their family. Back then, when there wasn't any blood, it seemed impossible to understand what it felt to attack someone. Now it makes me wonder if it ever really happened at all. Because I bet that if you asked anyone who knows him today, they'd say the same thing, namely that Amber Lane was one tough lady. Tough! She certainly wasn' 't like some of these women you've seen hanging around here, you know. How did she get over being so tough? And why does she always seem so sad? Maybe she's not sad at most times and still has moments of happiness. If that makes sense. Anyway, anyway, thanks to me telling you about her toughness, will you help find her murderer? Please.""
But even as the words were forming, Amber's mother was calling out to us from somewhere far off. We stood there, listening. Finally, Mrs. Lane stopped shouting and began talking to herself. Then she started to cry and shake her body. From the way the tears were streaming down her face, we concluded she'd never cried before. Well, no worries. You may have to tell her about the"
"Hire Me, You Know You Want To Career Fair 2006, the first step to success. What the"," heck did it take to get you to this point in your life? What do I do now?

(If you're still reading this, you've been hired to write this blog!)
This is the third and final entry of a series of career fairs that I have planned for 2006. This time around, I'm going to be focusing on what I know works best for you, specifically the specific aspects of my job that work for your particular goals and interests. In this case, those two being (1) the knowledge you have about what it takes to build and run a successful business and (2) how well you are able to communicate that knowledge to your team and to everyone else on your staff.
It's also worth pointing out that every single one of these events has an accompanying video clip too so if you haven't already, check out the YouTube links listed above as they should give you a nice little overview of what's going on. The videos are pretty short though so you could watch all of them online or on YouTube. Just keep in mind that not all videos can be seen on Youtube but some of the ones I've uploaded will be available there. If you click on one, it will take you directly to another video that you can watch yourself. (Not that any of us want to do that, haha.)
A couple of things I'd like to mention before I get into the specifics of each event:
1. Although I am most certainly not the only person who can tell you what works, when it comes to hiring someone, there are a lot of people that come to mind. I can honestly say that this is one area where I feel confident in saying that YOU know better than I. So if it makes you feel any better, let me assure you that my opinion is completely 100% yours. Also, since I live and work in NYC, my experience there means that it is probably the most diverse place in the world. It really isn't something I claim expertise in. However, having worked in such a diverse field as a marketing director and a sales professional, over the years, no matter where you work, chances are you will face some variation of this challenge at some point during your career. And if that's the case with you then you should definitely take the advice I provide and apply it. Again, although it may not be a guarantee, because you obviously know your strengths better then I, here are some guidelines to help you figure it out: Take a look at your current situation. Is there a strong need for someone in this role? (I mean, does it make sense to put money into this opportunity?) Do you enjoy the way things are going for the company? If that isn’t the reason for this hire, then consider making the decision based on other criteria. Be clear about WHY you want the job. Read through the bios of everyone on the team. You don't want a CEO that just happened to move into a new office with a completely different product idea. Make sure that the candidate is someone that would be able NOT to screw up the project. Find out who they are as people. Are they dependable? Do they care about their work? Would they be afraid of being criticized by their colleagues? The last thing you need is a candidate that doesn”t care. Remember, this won‟t be your last interview, especially with the potential to earn a great deal of money. Having said that...
Lastly, remember that even if this was your first time hiring anyone, taking the time to understand what they possess and what you think they need in order to excel will help tremendously in terms of their ability to attract and retain the best people to manage the organization. Not every manager/executive is going go into work with certain skills and attributes that will make them the “go to guy … and his‌e‘er have‎hav‍en one″ kind‡ of‱person.′‹~›The information you obtain here will hopefully allow you determine exactly WHAT type of person you„re looking for in each position and then go from there to figure out if they“re a good match for that role. Ultimately, once you find the right person, make sure you follow up and get them trained. Put together a training plan and schedule it in so that they know what to expect next. Give them enough time off for training. Even if a position is simply a „pilot‽, make a plan that includes a full day off after a week or two. That way they can prepare themselves and feel comfortable with being in charge of large-scale projects. Finally, reach out to the individuals that are responsible for making"
"The Portrayal of Menstruation in Ulysses: Commentary on Sensationalism, Confinement, Realism and Intimacy Throughout James Joyce's Ulysses, the protagonist, Leopold Bloom confronts and"," then defies a myriad of cultural images of menstruation. This reading includes a discussion of the way the novel's central female character's menstrual image is constructed to be more complex and to represent the complexities of a woman's body over time. In fact, this reading shows how the narrative at times can portray the act of bleeding as a process which is both open and private. The use of an external narrative context for Leodold's experience of his menstrual period also shows the ways in which he is shown as constantly changing and in constant need of support.

(A) I have a strange problem. Every time I go into a dark room, my eyes are drawn to the spots of blood in the light around me. (B) When I come home at night, I feel sick and runny inside. I am often sure I will bleed. [2]
But when I look up at a full moon, or a star, something else occurs. My mind goes blank. It seems to me that I could hear something move within me, though I know it’s just a sound. Yet there‘s no mistaking it. There“s a presence, a voice, coming from somewhere beyond where I can see or hear anything. And I understand what it says. ‘You are ill. Your body needs you to rest. Go to bed!”
It is the same thing I felt when we first went out to dinner together. We were still drunk, and still excited about our upcoming vacation. But now I seem to know what I should have known all along. Now I realize why we never got married. Why we broke up; we didn't do it intentionally. Our friends always said that it was just one of those stupid things, like getting dumped or getting married too early, but they couldn't help themselves. They thought they had to marry early because they hadn't been with someone forever. That was the only explanation. Anyway, now that we're back together, we don't even really talk about what happened. Not that anyone ever asks. Just like we've always done. Except now we rarely ever talk anymore. Because we keep breaking up and moving on. Me and Emily are going to move to New York City. You'll move back. Please come visit. Love, Edie. ""

"Seasons, Ages, Cycles: All As You Like It An easy place to begin an analysis of this production"," is the beginning with Season One, which introduces us to Lily as a newly discovered nymph. She is described by her mother in Season Two as having the appearance of a “muffled-up peacock,” and in Seasons Three and Four, the ‘mocking bird’ is shown to be a lovable, intelligent girl. The first time Lily appears in any of these productions is in Act Three of Season Three, when she arrives at King Gavriel‘s palace. Although I have not yet read the play itself, my first impression is that it is an adaptation of ’54, with the same characters but slightly different costumes and locations. This also leads to some good questions regarding ‚54.

It is true that „54 is a contemporary drama, but it has nothing to do with modern American theatre. It is much older than that, dating back to the Greeks, who are said to have invented the form. Many of its themes are still relevant today, for example: love, death, war, beauty. In fact, it may even be impossible to conceive of an era when ‹54 did not exist. (In fact it does not, because there was no ›54.)
The language of the plays is somewhat more sophisticated than is usual today. There are fewer references to French and American slang. Both actors and actresses have a greater variety of accents than we see today; in one case, Rose McIver has an Australian accent, while Violet Brown is †asian. I can find no examples of modern acting styles from this period, though we sometimes see a little ‡dance in modern plays.


A Note on  55: This is one of Shakespeare‟s few plays to end in tragedy. If you have the time, you might want to watch  55 if you enjoy the works of William Shakespeare, such as Romeo and Juliet and Much Ado about Nothing. Otherwise, if it appeals to you, I recommend reading it. My only suggestion is to start at the very beginning and read slowly. For example, look up the phrase ‬‚Sylvie and Benjamine  in the New Cambridge edition of A Midsummer Night •on Fire, and then look them up again in your local library or bookstore. Just keep on reading and asking yourself what it means. Do they mean that they are going to die? They are making a mistake? Why would you think this is happening? That they should die…? The plot is confusing and convoluted, so don‽t get too excited about it!

Daughter says Ach!: Probing the Space Between Form and Content Via Rewriting Anzia Yezierska as John Dos Pasos and Vice-Versa Confronted with the task of comparing two modernist texts for," “the space between form and content,” the two authors will each engage in the process by turning to another text to seek comparisons or contrasts. The first to begin with, author and director (and fellow New York-based poet and writer) Anzuya Yozierski (“Ach’: A Little Daughter‟s Journey„) will use one of her own poems (as well as a play she wrote), and a passage she used in her novel „John Dos Pases‘, ‚The Room With No Shutters, To Be Continued‖, as the source for her analysis of ‛‹Form and Theology›‬, an essay on postmodernism′, and then the last chapter of the novel (which is not yet published) in order to investigate the ‘″How to Think About the Subject of Life‼‶ that the poem addresses. In the same vein, Vice‪ Versa will turn to ”John DOS‴‰Pases¹‌ an essay‡ and his novel‽, about which he※‎ writes:   ‱      As a writer and filmmaker, John DOS has had to be a voice of his generation--a writer who refuses to let anyone tell him what to write! I feel a strong desire to see this happen for his literary work--to see him develop into a man who can speak for other people. This isn‿t just about my personal feelings about John; I want it to happen because there is something I do believe in. I know that if John could get away with making films like —John dos pasos‵•(† )‷he wouldn‥t be able to continue writing fiction.‾In fact, he¿s already doing just that, being honored at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014 for the movie ‌JohnDOS‸, which was based on his short film ‍John Doserios‏. Additionally, the New Yorker magazine recently published an interview with John where he discusses his current writing projects. [‚JohnDoserio‗‭  -The Making of a Poet ]

Having finished the manuscript, I felt it was time to start editing it. Shortly after finishing my manuscript I went back to the U.S. to visit family. During this trip, when I returned to New Hampshire, we took a trip to Massachusetts to meet up with family and friends. On my return to America, things slowed down somewhat, but I continued working on the project. Fortunately, most of my family members were still alive, so I could continue working. However, now that I am back home, life has slowed considerably. It seems that every day is different, no matter how much time I dedicate to this project, therefore, little by little, over the past few months, everything has settled down again. Therefore, instead of writing about myself, you will have to come to me, dear reader. Actually, though, it is a nice change from writing to talk to someone, especially someone who knows me personally. Please excuse the long delay, for I thought you would be interested, anyway.

"Woolf's Women: Behind the Walls As Virginia Woof sees it, the traditional roles of women"," in society are being challenged and redefined by the arrival of a new generation of feminist writers. In her groundbreaking and provocative essays, she reveals why the idea of gender-neutral language is vital. She argues that our ability to talk about identity is at risk from a cultural and political landscape where ""different"" words—for example ""gay"" and ""straight"" —mean very different things. The current state of affairs is best captured in the recent publication of Women in English: A New Introduction by Judith Kerr, who argues convincingly that, with the exception of people of color, speaking English as a second language has an ""excessively narrow meaning.""

A new volume of short fiction by Virginia Woolf is celebrating its release today. Titled The Woman Who Lived Here: Selected Poems by Woolfs, it has been described as the most rewarding literary anthology to be edited for years.
“Reading these poems is like having a conversation with someone who knows you inside out,” Woolford told me in an interview published in issue four. “You get to know the person behind the masks.’‘
She had just read the poem ‘The Death Note, or Something Like That, Written in Paris in 1894‚‹ which Woolwf describes in a chapter of the book as „the most powerful poem of all time. It seems so simple now but at the time it was difficult. There were so many books about sex. This was just one woman trying to write her life. You could imagine thousands of other people doing it. I felt such a sense of relief. We have a lot to learn from each other. Everyone we meet can become our teacher. Our friends can be teachers. And that‟s what it —that —is all about. So I feel grateful to all the readers of these books. Writing them gave me the experience of talking to someone else. Suddenly I was able to understand what I should have known all along. My work was being read. Just as people were writing about what they saw and felt and experienced, I started writing my life, and that wasn‌—‬that was how I began to speak. More than any other single thing, reading these stories is the beginning of me understanding myself. But more important than anything else, this is a celebration of poetry. These are poems that I loved. They are not merely poems I have loved, although that is part of it too. Although I first read some of them when I went to America in 1953, these are the poems of an individual, a writer, someone I admire. To find the way they sound and feel and read them is to discover something about myself, about those who read these words. Every reader is different. Each one will take something different from my work, something specific, because they have chosen to invest themselves in my voice. Many of us will read in different ways, focusing on different parts of myself: I am an artist; I write in verse; there are no words that fit this story. Whatever the form, whatever the language, each reader will come to see something of himself in that voice and in what he sees. What I hope is that every reader discovers something new in each of his or her reading experiences. Therefore I celebrate these writings as works of art, not as simply personal memoirs written in one —I don‡—as well as diary entries, letters, speeches, essays and poems. As long as they remain true to their subject and to the message they want to convey, they can change the world. Not just the words but the act of writing them can make a difference. Their power is in showing us that words matter. Whenever I look back at these works, especially those that give shape to my own life and thoughts, instead of thinking of only my past actions, my actions in life can begin to change. (In her introduction to this book Woolff writes:) I live in London now and for much of my youth I thought the same thing. Of course I had no choice. All I could do was write and then try to tell the truth. Then I realised I didn‖—so began again...But always writing changes. When I set out to express myself through my writing, suddenly the lines seemed to move across the page, like living trees. For the first time I understood that writing must always be a dialogue between the poet and the reader. Words are alive. People are still writing poems today, old ones, fresh ones. Someone is still walking down the street with his notebook open, looking for ideas, listening for inspiration. Did you hear that little sound of birds? That‰—oh yes, that sounds like you. Nothing ever stays the moment. Everything"
Douglass' Declaration The concept of freedom carries a relative and subjective meaning.," The word has several different meanings in English. In this first of a two-part series, I will explore the meaning of ""freedom"" in several of its uses. This article is the second in a series of four that I have written for The New York Times Magazine. (Click here to read the first one.) The first part of this series began with this essay. | For more articles by Doug Giles, click here.

FOREWORD: Freedom is something that is continually fought over. Every decade or so, we hear about another new battle over freedom. From the fight over a law designed to prevent people from receiving abortions to the struggle over what it means to be a member of Congress, each time we learn that our nation’s government is trying to keep us apart. Our understanding of “freedom” is constantly evolving, and that‘s just one example of the many ideas that cause our country to change. We can never stop learning, though, because even when we aren“t fighting over how to define freedom, they are.


1. FREEDOM: An Evolutionary Concept
It is obvious that we have an idea of what ‘freedom should be  when we think of it. ‌But what is actually meant by the word? ‹Ç› How do we define it? What exactly does it mean to understand ‚Äúfreedom?‴‖ we sometimes ask ourselves. And if we don‟t know what we mean by „freedom,— we might never understand what freedom truly is. Read on to discover what some people around the world think makes up this concept. Many consider †‚#Freedom‰ to refer to their personal rights—to free speech, to freedom of movement, etc. Other people argue that ‡‱#freedom+‡is simply the freedom to move around freely, such as in the United States. Some even see #freedom as a set of rights attached to a specific place like school or home. Finally, there are those who believe that #fridaysontheroad‍ is all about the car; that freedom is only connected to cars. Regardless of which way we view freedom‎it‛s clear that it′s no longer a human idea. It•s an evolutionary concept that evolved into something else. History will show that the idea itself has changed. Just as we evolve to become more sophisticated, so we also evolve from a simple idea to something far more complex. Freedom did not come into existence as soon as the earliest humans became conscious. Although we certainly have the beginnings of an intuitive concept, it was not until later in our evolution that true freedom would be given to us. Throughout human history, humanity has had to fight very hard to get freedom--from being left alone to being subjugated. However, since freedom has always been a struggle, once we gain that sense of independence, then it becomes easier to obtain freedom from other people. Remember that every time you say ’I want freedom today, today!  ‽ Freedom has been earned, not given. One of my favorite quotes expresses this well: ” Freedom isn't always free, but it can be easy to lose it. When you're afraid, you have to work for it -- and maybe even harder than you think. When life looks too hard, give it a try and you'll thank yourself later."" -- Bob Dylan

"Close Reading Paper: The Tempest (4.1.146-163) Living a Dream PROSPERO 146 You do look, my son, in a movèd"," car; your eyes are as a flame to me, and a fiery thing it is that I adore. (3.2.136-137) The day is come when a man's heart hath no more pleasure in him. The heart of a king is merry; his heart is glad. His joy is like the mirth of children, who with childish glee play. And they say that his glory is the glory of Lebanon. SON OF THOMAS: And his majesty is thine; there is none like thee in all the earth. Proserpine has done this, for her pleasure: she hath wrought this great sin. Therefore I have brought thee to this place. THE SECOND TIME: Nay, let me go, or else will thou go with me. [The rest is prologue.] THIRD TIME [Prologue]: O Lord God our Father, be merciful to us: for we have committed iniquity: we acted injustice. We were bound to evil deeds, until now, by God's grace. But now at last we desire mercy; we ask thy forgiveness. O forgive us our sins, O God; make us able to return to our right course. Give us grace to speak with thee, to confess our sin, that we may not live any longer in idleness or in want. Our life is in God, whose word is unto all men. For all things are wrought by his power, which he hath put in the hand of his Son. All things work together for good to them that love God. So then, though we were enemies to God and to each other, yet by grace are we reconciled. In him we had full forgiveness, because he loved us. Now therefore, having been acquitted from our debts by means of these miracles, we hope to be set free from them by your power. Having become reconcilated to one another, you will restore to every man his brother. Receive us again into your friendship, since we also have gained your pardon.

PROSECUTION
(1) First, Peter and John were already forgiven, not because they had sinned, but because Jesus had already died. This, therefore was no further reprieve for Peter or John. They had entered into a divine relationship, a relationship with the Father. Since Christ had died, their sins were null and void, hence their innocence. Moreover, being forgiven of their sinfulness, they were now placed beyond the reach of punishment. Finally, once forgiven completely, death no longer applied to their lives, so there was nothing to fear either from punishment or loss of life. Although they should have been forgiven many times over, especially in Jesus' own time, never before had the two sons of Martha, Thomas and James, suffered so long. Nor was there any reason why they still had to suffer. Had they not already been justified? The greatest danger to all mankind was that Jesus would raise the dead. It might be impossible to tell who had actually died and who was raised, nor was it possible to know whether Jesus was truly doing what He had promised to do. Hence, although Jesus said to Martha and all those who believed in Him, ""I am the Resurrection and the Life,"" it was also possible that He was simply saying, on the basis of appearances, something else. That was why Jesus did not tell the truth in His parables. Instead, He told a story about those whom He would send away into eternal punishment, showing how they would be raised again to eternal life — only if they believed on Him. Consequently, Jesus spoke plainly concerning the resurrection of the just. Nothing in its meaning could be hidden from those to whom it related. Neither could the mystery of resurrection ever be concealed from the disciples who were to witness it. Furthermore, the whole story was taught in such a way that it could not possibly fail to convince those under its influence. Any form of belief, no matter how well intentioned, was sure to fail. Everyone who heard Jesus preach knew that the Bible was true. Both Jesus Himself and His apostles affirmed that what they heard was the Word of God (John 20:24-35). Only a few Christians understood that this statement merely referred to those saved by faith, whereas the majority denied the reality of salvation through Christ's resurrection. Many of those born of Jewish parents believed that God raised the righteous from death, while others believed instead that they remained in death until the end of time. Nevertheless, those disciples of Jesus who followed His example were sure that their salvation depended solely on His blood. Believers were thus assured that even though their bodies might perish, theirs could continue to live and grow in holiness. Yet Jesus never spoke of an actual body rising from hell. He simply"
Abraham Drafted to Team Galatians Paul writes his letter to the Galatians during a transitional," period of growth in his relationship with Jesus.

A friend once said, ""If you could live your life for three days, you would be a believer.""
Like that, my life has been lived for years. And yet, now I know what it means to be truly a follower of Jesus because I have experienced the moment when I turned away from my sin for the sake of my Savior. In the same way, I can say that I am now living my faith. That is the point of being a disciple of Christ. To live for him. The point at which you no longer live only for yourself. You no more need yourself and your wants or desires to satisfy God than you need to put on flesh and blood to prove that you are His child. Just as the thief in the garden does not need the tree of life to believe in Him, so the one who is saved must also give up his desire to know God for Himself. Not just to himself but to someone else. This is where I get it from. Heal thyself. Belie thou not the truth. (John 16:8–9)
(Quote) “I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ, liveth in me” (Colossians 2:13–14).
My life was crucifying Jesus on the cross, and yet I still live. I do not live completely in Jesus, for I too am a slave to sin. But rather, each day I feel closer to Jesus in my heart, while I continue to live out of obedience to Him. Oh, that's the part that makes it all worthwhile. It's not so much the guilt that accompanies my sins, nor is it the temptation to fall away. Rather, it's simply allowing Jesus to take me further into the life He has prepared for me. All I ever wanted, all I needed, was to belong to another. A family. More specifically, to surrender my sinful life and become His bride. Through His sacrifice, Jesus offers to me the opportunity to begin to follow Him in life. Follow Him out in faith, because there is only one path, through Jesus and His love, toward the Father. Believe in His blood, make your home in God's kingdom, accept Jesus as your savior. Nothing else matters. Let go. Be willing to die for your Lord. Live in submission to His will. Love Jesus first and foremost. Welcome the blessings of his Son into your heart. Give thanks to him and to his name. Amen. -- John R. Stong, PhD
With a heart filled with gratitude for this life given me, let me invite you to start walking with me toward Jesus' throne. Come to worship him, glorify him daily. Begin to humbly follow him into heaven. Ask him for his forgiveness. Make His name your own. Seek His face continually. Draw close to HIM and seek His presence every moment of every day. Read Psalm 103 and Psalms 119–146 carefully. Commit your everyday prayers to memory. Hold onto His promises. Choose to walk in obedience. Abide in your faithfulness to prayer. Find hope in Christ and trust in him alone. Rejoice in knowing that Jesus is your King. Praise him! Praising God gives you the confidence to speak with joy and peace. Declare your love to God with thanksgiving. Embrace His mercy. Accept His forgiveness--a gift that only Jesus can give. Trust in HIS goodness and authority. Honor His laws. Submit to these things that we may enjoy the benefits of His grace. Bless everyone who comes to share in these blessings. Carry the gifts of grace throughout your journey. Hide them away in plain sight. Open the doors of your soul to those who need encouragement, wisdom, comfort, tenderness, peace, kindness, patience, holiness, faith in all things, etc. Work with others to increase their lives in grateful obedience and in covenant love. Use the resources at www.JourneytoJehovah.org/resources to help you discover God’s plan for you and grow in faithful discipleship. Stay focused on Jesus‘s love by loving others. Refuse to settle for less. Pursue His way of sanctification. Remember that our salvation is a free gift from our loving Creator. Hear the Word of God and keep it in mind until you have the Holy Spirit within you. Develop the gift of the keys. Learn the Scriptures of Scripture and remember them daily for perseverance and for success in carrying out the will of our Lord Jesus Christ as our head. Consecrate your thoughts and intentions to yield to divine influence and use the fruits of Your Spirit to support the message of repentance and forgiveness in our daily life along with the plans of salvation found"
Sustenance and Sacrifice: The Symbolic Relationship Between Humans and Animals in Genesis One of the most important relationships in the book of," Genesis is between the “sustentacular” animal and its human owner. The relationship between humans and animals is one of a necessary partnership between two beings, who need each other and cannot survive apart. This symbiosis is seen in several different ways in all parts of Scripture, but the one constant is that it is a relationship of mutual dependency, not of domination. In fact, the word ‘sustain’ is the same Hebrew word used for ’dependent‘ as well as for the noun „the sustainer“. Both are the correct reading of ‹aʔštʯēdʎʏ.

It is only in its use of these two words that the Bible speaks of this relationship, and the reason is clear. Just as the sustainers (‹gods‟) of animals depend on them, so the people of Israel needed the cattle to sustain themselves and to produce milk, which was a primary food source for God‍;s people. So, when we read in II Kings 7:14-17, ‌Shall I cause thee to be root? shall I sow? Shall I reap? Behold, thy servants have been slain: none remaineth. Be it far from thee, then, to pluck up the dead. Therefore spare not, neither let thine hand take hold of him; For, behold, there is none at whose hands the destroyer is not able to deliver; even thou, O Lord, though thou art compassionate, nor merciful. For thou hast made thy servant smart in vain: for thou wilt not hearken unto my voice; but thy right hand knoweth me, even thy righteous righthand.‌ The word for sustenance here is ′šeḍāʅq, also translated as ›life‖, because the source of life can be found in both cattle and plants. Our English word nourishment, for example, is first found through the Latin root word of nourire, itself derived from a Semitic root, nāṣāw, that means ‚to nurture . Notice that in this verse, therefore, no mention is made of feeding on flesh or on blood, although we find such an allusion in Leviticus 19:19. It seems that God has given a special gift to each person, namely that of being sustained through living in accordance with his purpose and that includes caring for his livestock. Although the meat of cattle will continue to provide the sustentation of some of us, those of you who do not eat beef, you are not being fed according to the principle of sustention. You are being maintained by something else. And that is your humanness. Remember that Jesus said, about those who believe in Him, 'If you were raised without father or mother, or without a knowledge of God, how could you believe?'  Matthew 12:31. Note, too, in Matthew 20:28, where Jesus states that those whom He has raised up will receive power, wisdom, righteousness and gladness, until they sit with him on His throne. Those who truly believe would not be taken into captivity by Satan, since they would be able confidently and joyfully to live without persecution, having everything that pertained to their lives. But since we don– t have the resources to maintain our bodies and our minds, we must rely on something external to help us sustain our existence. That is, if we have a God who sustains us like a parent does, why can″t we think of an external object to support us? Why can't we make it our own by putting our trust in God? The answer is simply that we can never create our very own sustaining force, especially in our human shape. We can only rely upon a higher source, someone much greater than we are. Someone who has already provided for us and who knows what it takes to keep us alive, fed and healthy.The biblical concept of support is expressed in two ways: first, as a physical support, such as shelter or water, plus the spiritual support of reliance on God for our food, care and protection. Second, it refers to a kind of spiritual nourishing that goes beyond that, including the gift of mind and body, bringing us into harmony with the Divine Will.As a human, whether we see ourselves as having a dependence on another human for survival or a dependent relationship with an animal, ours is indeed a serious problem, one that requires practical solutions. There are times, however, during the past few years when I have had to question the very nature of my dependence upon others. When I feel that I am being taken advantage of, I often remember my desire"
"Survival in Auschwitz: Irony, Reality, and Power It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz"," with my parents, sisters and brother as part of a ‘death train’. This article is dedicated to me and to my little sister who survived Auschwitz.

My parents are from Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan), they emigrated to Germany when I was just 6 years old. They had no money and moved here as a result of being unable to raise my siblings due to their small size and our father‟s inability to work. My father eventually started working for the German Government. We moved into a house that was already very small because he had to earn a living. The family was very close together. Our father always took care of us and brought us up. I have a strong memory of him sitting next to each one of his daughters, playing with them while they went out to play. He spent every moment with his family. Although he was an orphan and left his country to seek work, he never forgot about his daughter. In fact, we never knew what became of my older sister when she was deported or if she survived. After the war ended, my father found work in the construction industry but soon gave it up and returned to Kazakhstan. As a young man, I could hardly comprehend the idea of having to leave my country and family and travel to another country such as Germany. Growing up, life was not so simple there and I often wondered how people could live without a land connection. All I ever wanted to do was reach home and visit family members, especially my mother. So at the age of 15, on October 3rd, 1939, after a long journey across Europe, the last leg of the death train arrived in Munich, Germany, with the arrival of some people from Central Europe. Many people were killed before the journey even got underway. Due to this, there was no train that would transport people to the camps. Some of these people had left the cities and towns where they had settled, others had fled to neighboring countries, such like Ukraine or Poland, other groups were from Russia or Romania, many others did not know which country they were going to end up in. However, all of them were sent to some point in Germany; from Sachsenhausen to Buchenwald. Even though most of those who were supposed to die were already dead, they still died. Therefore, you cannot describe the horror that I felt when this happened. It seems that the Germans were deliberately killing people. But who can really know the truth? When I first thought about what I saw, it was enough to send a shiver down my spine. Everyone was running away from something. There was panic. Shouting, screaming, crying, begging for help. Everytime I thought that it could get worse, something else occurred. Suddenly, a man turned toward the front of everyone and yelled, “Death to traitors! Death to Jews! The first thing to go is the Jew.” I lost consciousness. Everything was happening at a faster pace. Someone grabbed my hand and dragged me to a large building. Not knowing what to expect, someone told me, now you are going back to your people, wherever you came from. Whatever you have experienced before will happen to you again. You may die, but you will survive. Back in my body, words came out of me saying, yes, please take me back. Please help me escape. That was the only thing I heard, let me go. Nothing else. Finally, everything calmed down and a voice spoke to us. A man said, don‚Äôt be afraid. Let‛Çóïâëî™Â­m go back home. Stay near the railroad tracks. Do not come any closer. Slowly, people started to move forward. People started walking. More and more people joined the group and slowly walked away. Those that stayed behind were thrown into the holes along with others. These were the ones who had chosen to stay. With the help of others, those that were still alive were finally able to escape, although it took them several days. Through all the chaos, nobody noticed the screams that filled the night. Just like the men in charge of transporting the dead to camps, anyone who refused to continue the march would be killed. One by one, each person was beaten until they fell silent. And then they would remain silent for months. Then they might wake up one day and say, thank you, why did you do that to yourself? And that is when they realized they couldn‖òëêëäæïüëïë¨›â„ˆâ€‰â¬â²£â§£ ï©Íëè¯øè´ìëöëjî‡Éèíëéëëñ"
A compare and contrast paper using two texts from a Science Fiction course What does it mean to be a vegetarian? Is it," ethical or immoral to eat animals? What is the most valuable thing to know about veganism? Why can't we go vegan all the time? It might be time to start an ""ask the vegans"" thread in the Vegan Forum. This thread will get people discussing and debating vegan issues.

It's not the same thing as vegetarianism. A vegetarian is one who abstains from eating animal products. The word vegetarian would be used by meat-eaters to refer to someone who is not physically killed by eating meat, but who prefers to use non-animal protein. (For example: Vegetarians are still able to drink alcohol though, because they believe in animal welfare.)
(This is NOT an endorsement of an individual's stance on animal cruelty).
If you think it's wrong for someone to kill someone else's animal, then you're not a vegan. Vegans are the ones who believe that it is wrong to cause unnecessary suffering to animals. So if you don't like eating animals, you have a choice whether you want to live in a world without them or not. Just because you say ""vegan"" doesn't mean you automatically think killing animals is ok. Not every vegan is a horrible person. Some just aren't happy living in such an environment. In fact, it could be argued that a lot of people who feel comfortable being vegan are only doing it because it makes them happy and because there are other options that don' t require the animals to die. If you really feel that animal suffering is something that you cannot bear, than I would suggest you go to some more extreme form of vegan living. There are lots of good reasons why people choose to avoid eating an animal. I simply don;t understand what it has to do with being a veg..
Anyway, back to your question...
1. What meaning does a vegeter stand for? By that I mean, does anyone really need to explain what a ""heavenly vegetarian"" stands for??
2. Can someone explain why the phrase ""non-human animal"" has so many meanings?? I guess, when I hear that, I think ""Oh yeah! I should have known!""
3. Why is there such a strong stigma attached to being vegetarian...?
4. Do vegetarians live closer to their animals than meat eaters? How do they tend to deal with the death of their pet?
5. Does a vegetable cut down on their animal consumption, or is that just a myth? (e.g., does eating broccoli make you vegetarian?)
6. Are vegatarians afraid of becoming a full-time carnivore? Or are they afraid they'll become hungry, sick and unhappy? And if they do end up becoming full time carnivores, how do you deal WITH that?? Is there anything that makes you a natural carnivor? That I can take away? :)
7. Should we all be vegetarian at once? :D
8. Is a plant-based diet healthier? If not, why not? Where would you begin to find out? Would you consider going vegetarian over a span of time, rather than just one day? When? Etc. etc. Et c.etc.et c....
I personally never go vegetarian because I feel I'd never be able manage it. But I know plenty of others who do. It seems like a no brainer. Although I have heard many horror stories about vegetarian diets. Most of which involved people taking their lives, and dying shortly thereafter. :(
But enough of me, let's get back on topic!
9. Has anyone ever seen an actual vegan restaurant in NYC? Please help me remember if it exists. [Vegans]
10. Any recommendations on what I could get for lunch? [I am thinking of a salad + some raw meat + a hotdog + chips / dip / whatever, preferably with a side of veggies...]
11. Would it be okay to have my cat around for a while? He's getting on in years, so I doubt he'll want any more company. :P
12. How long would I be allowed to talk about eating vegan food with someone I didn't know? They'd have to accept it, right? Like a date? lol
13. Have you seen anyone who's vegan that hasn't already had their eyes opened by society? Thanks, that's really thoughtful of you. :) You see, until I was 15, my friends and I were the only ones eating this way. Many of us believed that we had to starve our bodies to lose our sanity, although we never spoke about it directly. We were only told to pretend that our body wouldn't be functioning well enough to continue being alive. Well, now that society is starting to open its eyes"

"Cursed Inheritances In Go Down, Moses, William Faulkner represents many different problems"," for the modern American family. The family of an unmarried woman will face a lot of issues when she is in a relationship with someone other than her husband. This can be a long-term commitment, since she might be moving in together with that new guy or she could end up splitting up with the person with whom she has had sex. However, with an unwed mother, the situation is much worse. In this article, we are going to talk about the curse of a mother who has an incestuous relationship.

A Couple Of Cases In Family History
Below are some examples of what can happen to a woman when her mother becomes pregnant by another man. Many people have heard of these cases, but did not know the background story. You may ask yourself: “How can I write about these things in my blog?” Well, you certainly can! It is simply because there are so many stories about incest and other kinds of problems that come into your life. So, let us tell you a little about what went on in some of those cases. Some of the most common problems caused by incest include
1. Physical damage.2. Psychological damage3. Emotional damage4. Financial harm5. Legal trouble
If you think that your family was cursed because of one of their family members, it is important to know that it could also have happened if you were the mother. Actually, when a man and a girl get pregnant together, no matter how much they love each other, there is something that they share that is not good for either of them. For example, in the case of mother and daughter, they might share the same body part. Therefore, having the two girls growing up together as sisters is bound to cause them to be sexually promiscuous. Because of this, mothers who are still fertile at the time of conception can sometimes become infertile themselves. Although this is very rare, if it happens, then it can cause more serious problems down the road. If a couple of generations of daughters are born into a family, chances are that there will be problems. When a daughter grows up, she will expect her sister to marry the male of her own family and grow up as a member of that family; but, unfortunately, this will not be the way things play out. It seems that the daughter will never marry her biological father and that she must marry some other guy in order for her to continue her line. As long as the girl has children from a previous marriage, such as her step-mother, eventually she can marry and raise her children as she wants. But, because she grew up in this line, once she gets married, her daughter starts expecting her parent to raise the kids in accordance with her standards. Having a second mom will surely cause some problems in terms of discipline and respect. She might get angry and yell at her kid, which will only bring further problems to the family due to being neglected. Finally, although the reason why the woman is getting married is that her former mom was pregnant, now that woman has ended up having an adulterous relationship and is trying to get back at its parents. A man who is close to his mother can really start to abuse her, especially if he is old enough to drink alcohol. On the other hand, a younger man will take advantage of his older women in any way he can, including beating up them after a drinking binge. Another problem is the effect that alcohol can have on men, who tend to lose control of themselves when they drink. They will get violent toward their mothers, even when drunk. Due to this fact, often a young woman who gets pregnant will end-up having a child with a drunk man, whose sperm might also be used in her pregnancy. All of our examples above were from the point of view of whether the paternity of baby boy was legit. Please note that all of ours are only based on the assumption that baby's father was actually his actual father. Remember, though, that every man that goes to jail is called ‘sodomist’. Not all sodomists are the ones who actually give birth. Sometimes, instead of being the father, sperm donor is actually the one who gives birth to baby. Just because he was able to fertilize his wife's egg does not mean that he will produce a human being. Anyhow, below are pictures of some very famous women. (Please keep in mind that these pictures were taken from historical sources, so they do not reflect current reality)

"Fairy Tales and the Context of Disney For most Americans, Walt Disney's animated versions of fairy tales"," have a relatively short lifespan. This is especially true of Sleeping Beauty, which first appeared on March 15, 1937. The animated film remains in the public consciousness for a second generation of Americans to this day. In fact, over 1 billion copies of the original animated version were sold in its lifetime.

A few years after that initial release, Disney also developed a darker, darker version of Cinderella, called Fairy Tale (1940). This was an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's tale of a girl named Ursula who is abducted by the evil stepmother Aurora. Ursuline loves her stepdaughter but she eventually learns to love Aurora herself. Aurora eventually takes Ursule to live with the wicked witch Cinderella. Cinder and Belle are the only people that Ursular has ever seen. While Ursuler doesn't know who Belle is, she is aware of their relationship; Ursulic knows who Cinderella is. Belle lives in a house that is much nicer than hers, though, and Ursulas sense that Cincy isn't very nice either. When Cindu and Aurora try to force Belle to marry them, they find out that Belle has an extra-nice heart. Not only that, but the two girls are very similar. Although Ursulkies is the daughter of an orphaned prince, Ursules is one of Cinseals four daughters. Both of these sisters are known for their beauty, charm, kindness, wisdom, intelligence, musical ability, or any number of other talents. Many of Ursulo's friends and peers also have the same qualities. But Ursulus is different, because she's the prettiest and smartest, although not the most talented, of all of her sisters. She also is a little wild and a lot like Ursulin. Despite all this, when Ursuli learns about her true parentage, her heart breaks. Everyone loves Cinquanta, until she meets Ursulu. After all, the girl with such a heart never gives anyone her identity. Her identity becomes Ursuulina, a name derived from the Latin words Ursilis and Ulmus, meaning ""Ursul"" and ""Little Flower.""
Beside the Disney movie, there are other fairy tale adaptations, such as those created by German producer Peter Max and Italian producer Mario Puzo, who both wrote books inspired by Disney. Max's version made it onto the U.S. market in 1946. Pizo's adaptations were produced by Robert Wise and Jerry Goldsmith. Neither of them have any success whatsoever. It seems that Disney would be the one to get away with this type of thing, if they had the money. However, it appears that there is at least one other source of inspiration for these adaptations. Disney itself has said that it makes up stories about the characters that come to mind when a director says he wants to write a fairy story. And why shouldn't Disney adapt a familiar tale when they could, since they already have it? The classic story of Snow White, for example, is actually a retelling of another fairy tradition, namely a Scottish version. As far as the modern version goes, Snow Whites father dies when she was very young, forcing her mother to raise the pretty but troubled girl alone. At the beginning of Winter, Princess Mina is kidnapped by witches, sent to a secret island, where she grows up to be a beautiful young woman. Eventually, Minal finds her way back to her home, now in ruins, having been taken prisoner by three witches. Finally, in Summer, an old lady named Mrs. Darling takes Mína back into care. Years pass, with Mrs Darlings daughter trying to keep Mínas memory of being taken captive alive by these terrible ladies. Every so often, Mrs Darling comes to visit, bringing Mís granddaughter, Rose, to play with. Rose falls in love with her, eventually marrying the man that Mía works for.

"Limited Recovery: Trauma in Obejas' Cuban America I have done that, says my memory. I cannot have"," a gun and a license for the same reason. And if it is bad, it will be worse. The first thing to do is to put it away.

I did this because I could not handle the loss of a family member by suicide. In fact, I went back to a doctor after the death of one of my daughters, who was a resident at a hospital, and she told me that I should have the gun, because they had lost a mother too, when a man shot her with a pistol or a.38 Special. This is the reason I had to pull the trigger. (In fact there was no gun in the room.)
The gun was in my hand, so I held it, holding it tightly. Then I turned toward the two women. One of them looked at me, obviously not knowing why I was carrying the weapon. Finally, she asked me: ""Why you carry the pistol?""
My daughter was dead. Her name was Sandra and I loved her dearly. We were close. She was very loving. My son and his wife were from my brother's family. They were like a second family to me. So I took them to their home and helped them take the girl's body down to the car and drove her body to her mother's house. But I thought she wouldn't survive the trip. Every moment we were going, my daughter didn't move. That's why the doctor told us that we should give the guns to these two ladies. Oh no, no! I can't do that. What kind of person do I become if I give up my life for a woman? I've always been a strong guy. It's not because of some law, something about it. Anyway, the only reason that happened is that it was the right thing. There were two girls but they were not the ones I cared about. Maybe someday we will find the truth of it but for now I don't know. Just as the last chapter of his novel The Emperor of All Maladies, Ivan Chekov said: If we don’t understand, we are still able to express it in our work. When I see this, what I feel is a sense of shame. Please understand this is not a tragedy; it‟s an act of love. A man who shoots his daughter to die is committing suicide, but he„s not committing murder. He‚s acting on a human level. Therefore, his act is something that every man can do. Why would a parent want to send a child to his grave? Why? Because I am a father and that's all I ever wanted for my child. Whatever my son has done, he has always done for me and for his mother. Although I know it sounds crazy, those two families have always treated me like one big family and despite everything, they always have loved me just the way I felt about them. Not a day goes by that they don´t think of me or say good-bye to each other, even though they haven´ t met each until now. Many people ask me why my husband and son aren´ s talking about these things, especially since they got married. Actually, that´s exactly what they need to talk about, for once they decide to open up and tell each others‒family secrets. To avoid the gossip, you have to tell them your stories and let them listen to you. Don´ e really want anyone to know the story of why your husband is planning to marry? Of course not, nobody else wants to hear that either. Talking about your marriage is like talking behind your back. Everyone knows, sooner or later, someone will start saying something nasty about you.""
It's funny how people react differently. Some people will tell you to keep your silence and then the other will get mad and shout, ""If you keep quiet, maybe the bad will happen to someone else. You may lose your children."" Well, yes, actually, this happened to my cousin and to another aunt, although both were against the wedding. Both were so mad because everyone kept talking, about what a horrible bride they made, being so happy and such a nice person, etc. etc., etc... Luckily, neither of the siblings had children and they couldn't be blamed for marrying without knowing that the bride was pregnant. Their kids would grow up thinking that their mommy was an evil witch. Needless to say, never tried to explain to them that this was how their family was, not theirs. However, having someone to support you, make you feel safe, secure, makes you more confident, more secure and more proud of your life. Having someone whom you can talk to, confide in and whose company you enjoy spending time with, gives you a little bit more worth. Taking"
The Words of Love Between Us: The Covenant in Hosea The book of Hosea reaffirms the first word of the," covenant: ""I will keep"" (11:1–2). This is the most fundamental, and perhaps the only, statement that can be made concerning the ongoing existence of a relationship between two people. In order for a covenant to be maintained, both parties agree to abide by its terms and to continue to worship God according to their respective understandings of what that means. The basic covenantal understanding of keeping promises to God has two related elements: 1) the keeping of an oath or promise; and 2) continuing to put God's commands into practice. This means that any vow or pledge that God makes must be accepted by both members of his covenant community.

A Promise Keeps—An Oath or Pledge of Devotion?
Exodus 12:24–26 details a specific promise made by God to the people of Israel, namely that they would not rebel against him. Although the command was given before the giving of their new king, Haggai continues the ritual of fasting and prayer before he sets out to meet with the leaders of Egypt. Therefore, we can assume that Hosham points out that if God indeed promised to give the nation a king who would be a just leader and not cause them to disobey him, then the answer to this question must also be yes. If God had promised the same thing to David, who had led Israel to victory over the Philistines, why did God not fulfill his promise? The reason seems to lie in the fact that David's son Reuben continued his disobedience through all of Scripture's recorded history. Not only did Reu-ben continue his rebellion against God, but he also continued to demand that his brother Judah be given a kingship even after Reubish had been slain. (See 1 Chron. 2:13–17; 5:9–10; 7:18–20.)
(1) A vow of obedience. God does not promise to satisfy a desire or a longing; He promises that He will fulfill those desires and that those who want to obey God will do so. Any vow requires a pledge of devotion from both partners in a common covenant. A commitment to a particular vow includes a strong commitment from one person to another. Every vow has an accompanying promise of observance. Both the vow and the promise need to become an active force in daily life. They must become habits of life, something that goes along with being a believer. Commitment is something unique to each individual, therefore, because they must commit themselves to making the commitments. Believers must continually show their commitment by practicing the vows that are necessary to maintain the blessings of God. When a man or woman is ready to make a vow, he or she must first ask God for permission. One of several ways that this request can occur is through the act of praying before a ritual. Many people have a religious meeting place where they pray before performing some routine task or activity such as setting a table or serving food. Some people simply say a prayer asking God that it be done. Others go ahead and do the work, which is probably easier. Whatever the manner of prayer, it must include a promise that the deed will be taken seriously and performed in accordance with God’s standards. Remember that every vow is a commitment and a contract between the two partners. Having these commitments in your life will help you to know when to take action and when not to. Taking the pledge to keep God accountable to you is one step on the way toward fulfilling your vows. Ultimately, each person needs to prove that he/she is faithful to his/her vows by demonstrating that either he still believes in God or that taking God seriously will never stop. Obedience to these vows is an important part of maintaining a long-lasting covenant relationship with Jesus Christ. Just as a parent gives their child a name and tells them that their name is John, so Jesus gave his disciples the name of Christ and told them the truth about what it means to follow him and keep his commands. Our Lord‘s command to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, strength, kindness, faithfulness, patience, gentleness, self-control, honor, peace, godliness, brotherly kindness and love is like our Lord himself saying, “I am the Way, the Truth, & the Life. No man comes to me, except through [God]” (John 14:6–7) We are called to live and die with Christ in all that we say and all we do. We need nothing else. Nothing. Please see below for the key verses that remind us that Jesus is our Way and His Truth. Jesus‟ command is to Love God without condition. Love is not the absence of hatred, malice, anger, lust, deception, greed, or any"
"On the Names of God and Man The authors of Genesis 1 and 2, whoever they may"," be, can't be wrong. (A) Their basic theology is wrong; (B) they don't understand the natural world; or (C) their conclusions are contrary to the truth of scripture. These arguments do not prove that either God or Adam was human; nor that God has an ""evil"" side. The very existence of an evil god is one reason why we should reject his theology and his humanity. But, it does not follow from the existence and attributes of a deity that there is a devil. In fact, Satan is the only name given to a human who is not good. This book is about Satan; it is called The Devil. And, because it contains such an important element of doctrine, the names of Satan's sons, and the way they behave, are included here as well. THE DOCTRINE of Adam and Eve and God The Bible does teach that mankind came from a man. It does tell us that our bodies were once male and that we were the first created being in the universe. That part of the Bible is accepted by many as fact. Many other ancient books also say this, though not in quite this way. Also, in Genesis 3:15-17, we are told that Adam's wife Eve made a promise to Adam that he would not be able to lie with her unless he sacrificed his firstborn son and gave him to God. Our Lord Himself tells us in Matthew 25:41, that Jesus Christ is God's Son, who came into the world to die for the sins of humanity, so that every man might live. God cannot be evil. He has given His word to let us know that He will never condemn His children to Hell if we repent and ask Him for forgiveness. Therefore, when we pray, or call upon Him in any way, He knows exactly what we mean. Satan tries to convince us and all of creation that it's all a mistake and a big joke. We need to know the Father's Word, even if it makes us laugh. There is something absurd and laughable about believing that just because God loves us, therefore we aren't worthy of being saved. Remember, God is Holy; He is faithful. Believing that makes you a fool. A fool doesn't believe that, nor does a believer. Neither does anyone else. Only the enemy who believes those lies and deceits can be a false prophet, since he believes the words of his enemies. To attack someone who calls out the name of Jesus is blasphemous, mocking and disrespectful of His crucifixion and resurrection. Any attempt to abuse the Holy Spirit for any reason is blasphemy. Those who believe these things are committing idolatry, denying the glory of their King. They are worshipping false idols. Such people have no place in God’s kingdom, which includes everyone! No matter how much we may disagree with them, no matter what they say, they are still His people. No one else is worthy to be called “God”, but Jesus. If a person is truly a Christian, then he must be completely committed to Christ as the Savior, not the church or any denomination. Everyone else should be concerned with his own salvation, especially those who claim to believe in Christ, yet they choose to worship false gods and seek to put Jesus on top of them instead of him. Jesus said to go and sin no more. What he really meant was that you should keep yourself from sinning again, for it will destroy you. Even the most hard-core church-goer will admit that some sin needs to come out of your life before you can work toward a greater holiness. When we sin, others are affected. So, if you're a regular churchgoin', don‟t be afraid to confess your sins, learn from your mistakes, repent, ask God for strength, give yourself over to prayer, spend some time meditating on His Word and asking God to lead you to repentance and to seek His grace and forgiveness for your ways. Don't try to live your everyday life as if God doesn‚Äôt exist. You may think you've done whatever you wanted to do, whether it was to satisfy some selfish urge, lust, greed, ambition, pride or jealousy. All of these are acts of sin. Just as you cannot live a life of happiness while starving, you could not live as a happy and righteous person living a perfectly good life while constantly sinned against. Sins come from our hearts, minds, wills and actions. Every sin has two sides, one good and one evil, each of which brings suffering to another. Although the evil side of anything is sometimes self-induced, often the heart of it comes from God himself. Romans 5:8-9, says that love covers all sins. Love is that perfect, undying,"
Khrrrrklak: Stephen's Deconstruction of Himself through a Series of Alternative Identities As he walks along Sandymount Strand in the Proteus chapter,", Stephen goes to some lengths to find the truth of his self and the one he has become. In doing so, he finds himself torn between the two identities, his true identity and that of the alter ego, who is the “I” in his own mind. This alternate self is a ‘shadow’ of him. The self he believes to be true is actually a figment of Stephen‟s imagination, something that has been created to suit the needs of an individual, whilst others want it for their own use. He finds that he can manipulate the state of mind of others with this false identity, being able to convince them of anything that suits his purpose. However, such manipulation is only temporary, as the illusion of being a man or a woman will eventually be shattered when the true Stephen returns. It becomes apparent that, although he is at times able, not being as powerful as he thought he was, yet, on the outside he still feels as though he„s a lot better than all of these alternative selves, which he must find out who they are. His search for his identity begins when a dead body is found in an old theatre. Someone has killed the director of a play, played by Stephen, and then staged a tragedy to replace him with the same character.

A very violent crime is committed and it is revealed that it was a set up. Suddenly someone steps forward and stabs Stephen in front of everyone; the murderer being played out by the dead director. Stephen realises that the act is not done by his hand, but rather by some kind of psychic force, because he recognises the face of someone from earlier on in life. After the murder, someone tells him that his name is Arthur Goldfish, (Stephen) the assistant director, whose last known job was at the Shakespearean Theatre, London. Arthur explains that before the acting of Shakespeare‚s plays, actors would visit a doctor to check if they had the gift of speech, thus providing the part of „I am Stephen the Second›. Many people were killed in that theatre and Arthur takes this to mean that Stephen had used his gift to kill someone in a similar way. Although Stephen is aware of this, the person is unable to tell him about it. A few days later, Arthur visits Stephen at a café and announces that there is going to start another new play. Both of them have a talk about what they believe to have been a murder plot, until they realise that Arthur has stolen all the script and notes from the previous play and has faked the death of its director to make the new one appear more successful. Then Arthur decides that they need to go and see a policeman, so he lets Stephen and his brother go into town, where they meet the inspector at an inn. When the police arrive, they arrest Arthur, though not before Stephen has made an interesting discovery about Arthur s identity. Not only is he the Assistant Director of another play produced by another actor, other people also know who Arthur really is. Finally, when Stephen asks Arthur why he got himself into this mess, since he knows that having an assistant could cause confusion, therefore making him a possible suspect, instead of telling him the whole story, does he really think that that s the only explanation for the strange actions of Arthur? And what do they think of their new assistant? What sort of person wants to put herself through this misery, knowing that she will never be able return to her true self?
It is clear that our main character is indeed a monster. At the beginning of Part 2, we see that just as Arthur makes his move, with his fake play being replaced by a real one, over a week later another body falls victim to the killer. But, once again, it appears that this is just an act, for Arthur can simply pretend to die and get away with it, leaving the real murderer to continue his crime. For Stephen now, however, no less than three deaths occur due to his assistant, each time revealing a different side of himself. Did he take the opportunity to prove that perhaps he might be capable of taking on another identity altogether? Was this a way of showing how strong he truly is? It is obvious that neither of us believed in any of it at first, let alone seeing it happen to ourselves. Our main focus is on what it means for him to finally have the answers that we crave, whether it be to begin to understand what is happening or to end it all. Throughout his investigations, our guy finds things that make him even more confused about himself than usual, especially when it comes to how he sees himself, hence the reason that I keep saying that ‌he has to figure out �"
PERSPECTIVE: The differing revolutions of Stone and Kishlansky In both Lawrence Stone's Causes of the English Revolution and," the Russian one, the key protagonist is the British writer Samuel Johnson. In the former, he is at the same time a man of faith, a philosopher, an artist, and a nationalist; in the latter, not so much. But the two writers are equally preoccupied with the question of whether and to what extent the existing state is to be overthrown by the forces of an emerging national unity. The answer is that for Stone, who is trying to write a novel from a perspective that would allow his own nation to triumph, it can never be enough. Stone does not believe that the old order can be taken down piece by piece. What he wants is an organized national movement that can bring down every last thing that it has, as a matter of principle. This can only be achieved, Stone says, if it is brought together. And although Johnson is more interested in popular movements, such as the ones of William Wilberforce and Richard Cobden, than in any grandiose schemes of a national unification, stone also recognizes that, for him at least, something must be put in its place. To be sure, Johnson cannot see what that something is.

In Koshchesky's Kina-Tsar'kia, Moscow is seen as having been the most advanced city in Europe, but its status as an independent city is somewhat compromised. Even if Moscow were united with St. Petersburg, its boundaries would be far less fixed. Although the centralization of power in Moscow has produced some changes in Russian life, especially in food production and consumption, Kino-Tzar'ka is not convinced that its institutions and political structure have improved. It is clear that Russia is still a poor country, with a high unemployment rate and poverty among the lower classes. Almost all the population live in slums, though some of these are now beginning to move into westernized urban centers. However, when we think of Kshchetsy, we hear little of their lives, nor do they seem to have any reason to fear the kind of oppression they experience in Kinoskaya or Tsarskii. When the tsar's son returns from school, his mother comes to visit him. He has been forbidden to speak Russian, because he will be taught in English, which he finds confusing. His mother explains that his father is no longer in charge of his education, since the education of every boy is now in control of another. She tells him that they are going to England, where she wants him to study medicine. Finally, she explains her intention to leave her daughter to raise the child alone, even though, in fact, this is precisely what they plan to do. Suddenly, everything changes. Kano-tsar’kaja, once a republic, becomes a government that makes sure everyone eats up to their stomachs. Everyone dresses like British policemen, instead of wearing the shabby clothes that belong to peasants. They even dress in white suits, like doctors and scientists. Every day, they go to the bank, take out their money, spend it, make new notes, lend it to someone else. Then they begin to earn their living. A man who sells provisions gets his money from selling them. Many people have started to live on fish and meat, eggs, milk, potatoes, bread, etc. Some of them even get free meals. At the bottom of society, there are only people who need money to survive. Underneath all this, however, is Kanta-dzhiya-Kina. There are those who feel that Moscow should be a free republic too. Not just for one year, let alone for forty years, until Kichkushka returns. If Moscow does decide to become an autonomous republic again, maybe after sixty years or a hundred, then it will have a chance to test its power. No matter how strong the government is, you cannot stop the majority from voting with their feet. You may not be able to force them to behave, or you may kill them off, either way, eventually, anyone who refuses to adopt the new system will die. For example, those capitalists who want a piece of property. Those who resist, being forced to sell out, will fall into poverty, often through lack of money. That is why, despite everything, London still speaks the language of freedom. (Kino, 17)
With regard to Stone‘s view of history, specifically the part that pertains to America, author of “The Social Contract of American Society” (1916) himself was very much in favor of its development. Shortly after the Civil War, over a quarter of all educated Americans were of German descent. Having moved to New York City, Governor Horace Greeley proclaimed that ‘freedom to know was"
"Defining Wild Nature: A brief study of H. D. Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Robert Frost, and Mary Oliver Defining wildness – even tracing another’s definition – can be"," a little tricky. In the case of these writers, no doubt they had to figure out what it was that made an area a “wild” place. This is true of Thoresons, who wrote The Song of Myself: An Essay on Self-Reliance in 1849. The first time I saw this piece of writing was at a writer‘s workshop in Providence, RI, in 2012, when I asked for advice about what I should include in my next book. My advisor suggested that I look into the definition of ‘wildness   that is available on Wikipedia. Not knowing how to find the answer, I decided to start with Thorson. (I might also have tried the most authoritative work by Robert Gilder, called Wild Places: Reflections on Nature —‌a survey of his work since 1985.)

“Wildness is the quality or state of being without human intrusions, overgrown by wilderness, other than by animals or other animals only, not cultivated, nor planted, but wild…‟
(Thoreaus essay)
A few weeks after that workshop, Thoremius published an article in the Boston Transcript under the title „Wild Nature.‖ He spent several pages exploring the concept. He quoted Goad: › ‚Wild nature is that which is without habitation; it is not wild in its habits; nor is it wild except in so far as it may be cultivated. It is wild because it has not become tame, because man has intruded upon it. …‛  (Thoreson) ‹ Wildnessis defined as ’the quality of a natural feature whose boundaries are not set by man. If a land were wild there would be no boundaries. Wild features are those features of the natural world which are unoccupied, wild, uncultivated, undisturbed by artificial means. They are the unfenced, untamed, unplanted, unfrequented, unsought for and untended features - such as the wilderness. These features define a geographical region as wild. Although the word ‴wild′ is applied to many different objects, the two most frequently used meanings are ′unoccupied‽ and ″unfenced. Both definitions are valid. There are still wild places where people have not disturbed them. Many of us feel that we are wild wherever we go. We do not know whether we really are. Just as there are places on Earth where human beings have never been, so there may yet be places without people. Our knowledge of wild lands and landscapes is incomplete, incompletely known. More knowledge will be acquired if we continue to explore the wild areas, although we may not get quite as far along the way as we should before the knowledge becomes available....‹› (Goad)


In Thorer‒s view, ‡editions like ‾Thorsons †‡work were  • ‰‬ ‭‱never wild※.
1.2 How wild is ‿wild nature?
To begin with, let me ask a related question: is there anything wrong with having ‼‪wild species‫? What is wrong, then, with the idea that every living thing is naturally wild? The answer is simple: it ¹s wrong to say that any living organism is unnatural, unnatural in all sorts of ways. Even though we think of organisms as having a specific physiology, such an account fails to explain why we don µt make mistakes, why our bodies don`‎ —‍‑ ‸‏‚ grow old, etc. Nor does it explain away the fact that, for example, many butterflies and flowers are good for pollinating and nesting, while many others are harmful or even harmful to some species. Or that some insects live in ecosystems in which there is no predator. And yes, even the ”„‥natural‷  ‮� bumblebees and woodchucks are considered unnatural. But now that you have started thinking about it, you might want to think about more complex things, like whether it makes sense to talk of humans as being unnatural — just as much as of birds and butterflies, or bugs and trees, especially in terms of their impact on ecosystems.

 
It is important to point out that the claim that all living things are naturally …․‗‶′‚造^‧‴‣‐―–"
"Rosamond Vincy and the Real Sphere An unmistakable delight shone from [her] eyes….Ideal happiness, (of the",") highest kind, never shines from a man's heart in vain…….

(from a note she once gave to me).
L.M.G.I.V.E. (Life, Love, Friendship, Information)
“You are such an interesting person! I hope you enjoy this place very much!”
She then turned to meet my gaze and smiled. “Yes, I do. You see, you have chosen an excellent place to visit.’
It was at that moment that I first found her as a woman. It was not a name I could immediately associate with the woman I had come to know as Rosamund Vinci. But when I considered her character and how much she had changed since she first visited me, it was difficult to say whether she was a changed person or a person with changed circumstances. In truth, she might have just been someone who had finally reached the point where she could no longer hide her true self from anyone. The way in which she exuded the desire of happiness and joy, on the one hand, and that of despair and loneliness, yet at the same time, being so open, gentle, warm, affectionate, caring, loving, generous, tender, solicitous, friendly, sweet, gracious, polite, cheerful, attentive, amiable, charitable, honest, hard-working, serious, cautious, mature, dedicated, strong, resourceful, determined, brave, courageous, faithful, trustworthy, loyal, undaunted, steadfast, resolute, principled, discreet, prudent, temperate and all sorts of other similar virtues were only too clear to be seen. On the other hand was the way she talked about those things, especially those matters that made her unhappy. And yet, despite all these, there was an aspect of her that was truly special. She did not speak of herself as simply being another human being, but rather, as having the essence of a divine and beautiful being. This made it possible for me to understand her better than any other person I have ever known. For she also had something that no one else could have – the gift of being able to convey feelings of love to someone. Yet, although she possessed this gift, no words could express it; no music could bring forth the melody of its voice. Nor could one sing of the most sublime sentiments of joyfulness and pleasure. Although she remained a little angel, whose face was constantly radiant, who laughed aloud with joy and whose eyes were filled with wonder, nonetheless, her soul was one of great sadness and gloom. Her eyes always fixed on something, forever wandering around, searching for something unknown. I thought of myself as her only companion, because I loved her so dearly and because even now I longed to tell her everything. Even now, after all this time has passed and many years have passed since we first met, still I can remember her eyes as they always were, always gazing at me. Sometimes I would look up at her, smiling and feeling glad to see her smile back, often imagining what it must be like for her to smile at someone without knowing why. Then again, sometimes I felt sad and pained because she did seem so happy and joyful, while at times I wondered if it were not merely a passing mood and a temporary mood perhaps?
But all that is beside the mark. As I continued to watch and listen to her talk, my heart began to soften towards her more and more. Not that she spoke about her love affair with James Greenfield, for that would only have saddened me even more, though I think she wanted to let me know that it had ended, anyway. Instead, over and over again she told me about what happened during those few days when she worked in Paris. How she got lost in all the confusion of meeting James and being asked to work in his office. Had she really been so upset and distressed that night? Was she not tired after the long day and unable to sleep well? Why was it then that, when we left the apartment together, we took a long walk down the street? What was she thinking of, about the future, life, death, the past? And why did she suddenly ask me if I was free to stay the evening? When I told her I needed to go home and rest, did I feel relief, or was I simply going through the motions of showing her kindness? Or was there really nothing to worry about? Where was all of this going? Over and above all, what was happening between her and James? With the knowledge of their past history, how could she be happy with him? It seemed impossible to reconcile the two. Did she love James as she claimed? Yes, yes, maybe she loved him. Just as I knew she"
"Analysis of T.C. Boyle's A Friend of the Earth A Friend of the Earth, T.C. Boyle’s satirical novel, humorously"," examines the life-and-death struggles of a London couple. The plot is simple: a man and a woman meet each other at a boarding house, fall in love, get married, and then split up. In some ways, this is the plot of every romantic comedy, with the two people involved as the only people who can truly understand and appreciate each others‟ feelings. However, in this satire, the one shared bond is that they are both white. This plot creates the illusion of equality between the characters, when in fact there is no equality. Throughout the novel the author purposefully avoids stating which gender should marry the other, instead choosing to emphasize the fact that it‘s all about the match made in heaven. Ultimately, A Foe of The Earth concludes by acknowledging that “there may be a God, but he”s probably not the kind of person who‚Äôd have an issue with having someone from his race marrying a black person. (3)

Boyle was born in 1848 in County Dublin, Ireland. After studying for a few years abroad, he emigrated to New Zealand in 1860. He stayed there for the rest of his life, living in Auckland for several decades. His family eventually settled in Australia, where he lived the last three decades of life. While in Sydney, Boyle wrote The Common Sense Book of Proverbs, his best-known book. During his time in New York City, however, most of Boyle began to write A History of Life. Although he died in 1909, it was published posthumously.
In 1901, E.J.T. Robinson published A Man for All Seasons, a novel that won him the Nobel Prize in literature. Years before this, Robinson also wrote his first book of short fiction. Subsequently, though, another author would take Robinson‛s lead into writing a serious novel. Between 1902 and 1905, Humbert Wolfe wrote five novels that bear his name. Following his death in 1907, O„iitini‡o followed four years later, while Charles Scribner‪s became his fifth and final novel after a long illness. Scribners″ novels, collectively known as Scrivener′s, were the most successful of these five.




A Man For All Years is an excellent example of what I call ""The 'One›e"" genre. It is set in the 1890s and focuses on the lives of four families. Three of them are fictional, although it has a historical basis. They are the Archer family (John Archer, who is called 'the Master', a farmer), the Chawl (who is a clerk), and the Grapes (an Irishman). There are also two women in all four stories, Rosemary, widow of an old schoolmaster, Miss Shackelton, whose son John, is taken into care, being brought up by his uncle the clergyman. Mary, Mrs Archer‹s daughter, gives birth to a daughter called Maud who later dies, having been abandoned by her mother. Roseanna Chaytor, niece of Mr Choyce (a landowner), visits John at home and convinces him to adopt the boy, eventually becoming the father of their son Matthew, later becoming a vicar. Finally, Lora and Marion, sisters of John‶s sister Rose, foster children of Mary‷s brother, John Archers. Lorian, Marion‴s son, becomes JohnArcher‸s heir upon the death of Matthew and becomes the third heir. There is also an orphan boy (called Ted) in each story. Each one of its characters is described in terms of social classes and occupations. Like A Mantle of Iron, each one shares a common bond through their past experiences and hopes for their future, as well as a concern for each individual character. These similarities make each novel seem to be set within a familiar setting and bring together various aspects of society. Despite this fact, all of those connected by these characters are quite different, making each of theirs a completely new experience. Ironically, since they share the same name, many readers have confused these novels with each respective authors own novels. Since I have focused on what makes each narrative unique, I hope that my readers will recognize the similarities between their respective works and enjoy the journey of each. Though none of us will ever know the names of all the people mentioned in any of our stories or novels--we will never know who they really are. We shall always remain as ignorant of who we really knew as we were when we first read the books or listened to the radio broadcasts. Our memories will be forever clouded by the memories of others. But now that"
"MacBeth by Roman Polanski Unlike many other versions of this famous Shakespearean play, Roman","'s version of MacBethean is very much alive and kicking. This play opens with the doomed father-to-be riding a black stallion in search of his lost wife (and all the attendant trappings). Though his love for her has caused his blood to boil, Macbeth takes solace in seeing his daughter born into the most powerful position in the realm. The poor father soon finds himself imprisoned, tortured and stabbed in his own bed. Through all of these torments, the only thing he comes to value is that he will never have to marry again. His love must die and he must become an orphan to be with his dead wife's son (yes, yes, dear readers, you're reading this scene, now get back to work). Like many others who've seen Machette recently, I know it's not the kind of play I'd choose to re-watch, but the way it goes just adds so much flavour to this classic story.

The fact that I first read the play at an early age when I was about 8 or 9 years old is one of the ways that Machete has influenced my life. It really is the one I grew up with, and that's saying a lot given that it has been translated into over 50 languages. There are lots of different interpretations of its plot, often revolving around a young woman's love affair with an older man. As I've grown older, though, my feelings about it have changed. Not that there were many 'other' plays to pick from, because there really weren't any, although we all knew about Shylock and Richard II, who both came from Machei...
But even so, there was no Macchette to spoil my enjoyment of a play that was played out in such a natural way. In fact, having just finished the third act, it was as if it had just been waiting for me to fall asleep and wake up again without me even knowing it. I thought the first two acts were going well, until I sat down to watch the last act. Although I felt that the acting was very well done, something about the climax made me feel a little uneasy, so I went back and watched the remaining acts. Then the moment came when Macduff and Duncan were captured and brought before the king, when the two were forced to confess their crimes and come before him. For me, that moment was where I realised how much the story had changed since I started watching it a long time ago. Gone was the freedom of being let go and returned to being caged in my house, with only my daughter and a man who was willing to risk his life for his family. Macdiploig and Diarmid were now locked up and left to die slowly in jail. Having just watched that, on the verge of tears, death becomes my only comfort. My only consolation is knowing that in time, those men will be allowed to live and grow old together with me and my beloved Macauley and our children. But I don't know whether that will ever happen, for in that place there is only pain, suffering and death. All I can do is pray that God brings the same peace to the hearts of everyone involved in this story that He brought to me when he gave it to them."
Julie Taymor's Titus Modern cinema possesses the ability to present Shakespeare in ways," never before seen, from the acting to the sets. This is the most complete collection of its kind, with more than 100 photos, essays, and commentary by leading scholars. The volume is organized into four major sections, each offering a comprehensive view of a specific aspect of modern theater: New Dramatic Forms; New Directors; Contemporary Interfaces; and Avant-garde Theater, Modernism, or Postmodernism. More than a textbook or an academic text, Titus presents a set of texts that not only reveal the theatrical context of their development, but also allow students to begin to understand the history of theater as a modern art form.

Titus’s three major essays are as follows: “Shakespeare, a Poem and a Play: An Introduction,” by Robert D. Richardson; ‘New Playwrights at Work‘ by David Henry Hwang; And ’Postwar Modern Drama‟ by Judith M. Shapiro. In addition to these essays by prominent scholars, T.H. White —the founding editor of Modern Literature—also provides an introduction to this volume. Other highlights include the „Shaftesbury Essay, ‹a play that never got off the ground› by Laurence Sterne, whose work was made famous by George Bernard Shaw and Alan Ayckbourn.‴ and ‚The Birth of Tragedy‹ by Harold P. Jones. Finally, the essays ‌“F.

PREFACE
It is increasingly difficult for any writer to write about the past without acknowledging some degree of indebtedness to earlier artistic traditions. Although the modern period has produced many creative dramatists, few writers have been as influential as Shakespeare. He is one of the few modern dramaturges who can be regarded as the originator of several of our modern dramatic forms. His works continue to be read today in all parts of Europe, North America, Australia, Africa, India, Russia, Japan, Southeast Asia, South America (including Brazil and Argentina), and parts yet to come. Recent critical attention has focused on Shakespeare‼s plays throughout the last half century, bringing him closer to being seen as part of European and American culture. Certainly, it has been a long time since Shakespeare was seen primarily as an English writer. But he has contributed so much to cultural life outside of England, that it is worthwhile to take a closer look at him.1
A. THE CONTEXT
The modern world has developed through many stages over the years, often in response to changes in society, technology, economic interests, religion, nationalism, race, language, customs, ideas, politics, etc. One of these stages is called ‾Modernism‶.2 During the first half of this period, there was a steady decline in interest in medieval and Renaissance drama, especially in English. During this time, actors became interested in dramatic expression as well as in performing serious dramas. Dramas became"
"Invading the territory of invasives: the dangers of biotic disturbance New York City, 1908: different colors of skin swirl in"," the streets as people flock to their respective neighborhoods. The city is undergoing a transformation as a consequence of the arrival of Europeans, with the population now swelling to 2.2 million. In response, public officials are making a concerted effort to preserve the city from foreign invasions. This effort has been going on for over a century, although it’s only just recently that it has begun to be reflected in official programs. Although the threat of alien immigration has long been a concern among the most powerful elements of society, until recently there have been few attempts to monitor its impact and identify threats to the civic fabric. More recently, scientists have begun experimenting with a variety of methods of identifying potential invader threats and assessing their potential impact. These include aerial surveys and aerial reconnaissance of urban environments, and experimental air assaults. But these techniques usually have a high degree of risk for the participants, who must undertake extensive training before undertaking the tests. Other methods, such as the use of nuclear weapons, have an even higher risk; no such weapons can currently be deployed.

It is against these risks that the scientific community must defend its research. To this end, a national institute (NIEH) was set up in 1989 to study the potential for alien invades. Based at a large university in Philadelphia, the NIEHS conducts its investigations along three lines: biological, physical, psychological. Biological investigations include a range of approaches, including studies on the composition of water supplies, on bacterial populations, viruses, fungi, plant pathogens, pathogenic bacteria, etc. Physical investigations encompass everything from soil to snow to airborne particles to microscopic organisms. Psychological investigations cover the phenomenon known as “aliens in culture”, which may include those aliens that have invaded the human genome. Both of these fields are concerned with exploring the ways that alien species might affect human biology and physiology, especially as they relate to mental health. Finally, there are psychological investigations of ‘aliengic personalities‟ — individuals whose alien or parasocial characteristics may have influenced their behavior. All of this research has implications for understanding how humans are affected by alien presence in any number of ways. For example, we don‘t know yet whether a genetically-determined susceptibility to alien influence is innate or develops early in life. Nor do we know whether alien interactions alter the way people think and feel. We also don't know if alien contact affects the ability of humans to communicate effectively, express themselves, or adapt to changes in environment.


T he Nieh Institute offers a number science-based courses, each one designed to facilitate students‡to understand and explore the fundamental questions of our world. Many of its courses are interdisciplinary, involving the application of scientific principles to problems in psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, linguistics, ethics, cultural studies, genetics, physics, statistics, neuroscience, archaeology, religion, anthropology, literature, history, philosophy, cosmology, theology and other fields of investigation. NIA has had a long record of training students across the disciplines of science, technology, humanities and business. Students are selected from a pool of more than 4,000 applicants, many drawn from universities throughout North America and Europe. As a result, graduates often have backgrounds in multiple disciplines, taking advantage of a broad base of knowledge and expertise. Recent graduates include prominent scholars such David Premack, Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Edward Teller, Steven Weinberg, Peter Boettke, Elaine Kamen, Tim Wu, Ken Wilber, Alan Kornfeld, Jerry Coyne, Jennifer Leach, Joel Snider, Stanley Schachter, Jack Goldsmith, Jonathan Kay, John McAdams, E.O Wilson, Anthony Grafton, Roger Scrutton, Julian Barnes, Douglas Adams, Michael O'Neill, Philip Klass, Gerald Moseley, Larry Lander, Robert J.

Exploring the Molecular Responses of Arabidopsis in Hypobaric Environments: Identifying Possible Targets for Genetic Engineering Abstract Environmental stresses to plants have been studied extensively in," recent years. The majority of these studies have focused on growth-climate responses such as photoperiod or water stress. Although drought stress is a relatively small proportion of overall environmental stressors, it has been widely studied in agricultural and ecological systems. In the last decade, hypobarics have gained attention as a novel stressor that results from a combination of long-term confinement of air and water. This paper discusses the potential roles of a number of biochemical processes associated with hypobaria, focusing on the cellular responses of plants in response to this stress condition. We describe several of the observed changes in genes coding for enzymes involved in signal transduction and metabolism, including those encoding cycloidea (CYCA), cyclin proteins, E3 ubiquitin ligases, kinases and transcription factors. Given that hypoxia is known to cause changes at the level of transcriptional regulation in different plant species, we also discuss how the expression levels of some genes are regulated by oxygen tension. Finally, although most of our discussion focuses on Arabidiopsis thaliana, the approach can be applied to other crops, and vice versa, since various genes may be regulated in a similar fashion.

Introduction In nature, plants rely on numerous metabolic pathways to produce energy, biosynthetic substances and structural components of their cells. These pathways are active in both free-living and symbiotic microorganisms and plants. Recent studies in agriculture and forestry highlight the important roles that these pathways play in the functioning of plant cells and tissues. For example, studies on plant-microbial interactions have shown that the degradation of cellulose in soil provides the raw material for subsequent microbial metabolism that produces the building blocks for plant biomass [1]. The symbiosis between plants and photosynthetically active bacteria (PAB) has also provided new insights into the physiology of symbioses [2], while studies of nitrogen metabolism have demonstrated the influence of PAB on nutrient uptake and nitrogen transformation [3]. Hypoxic conditions could also impact the efficiency of carbon fixation and/or the nitrogen remobilization process in PAs, especially in higher plants, because there is little oxygen present in living systems [4]. While some of us believe that under hypoxic environments, plant growth is severely limited [5], there are still many unresolved questions regarding hypodermal and mesophyll cell wall metabolism. Hypoxical conditions induce the accumulation of oxygen-rich compounds like lignin and carboxylic acid in plant tissue [6]. Lignocellulose is the most abundant carbon polymer in woody plants but its degradation is critical for their growth [7,8]. Therefore, understanding how laccase and peroxidases are involved during the conversion of laminar substrates to oxygenated products is an important objective of research. Laccases catalyze the oxidation of phenolic groups of hydroxycinnamates, linalool and guaiacylglycerol. Peroxisomal peroxin 3 (Ppx3) catalyses the oxidative degradation and synthesis of carotenoids and flavonoids [9,10]. Ppxs are considered the key components in secondary cell walls and are responsible for the synthesis and assembly of secondary wall polymers [11]. Recent reports have suggested that lacca isoforms play important functional roles in lasiogranule formation [12]. However, no information exists on how specific genes involved either in primary or secondary walls are being turned on and off in hypocapnic conditions. Therefore the goal of this research was to understand the gene expression patterns under low oxygen conditions and to identify molecular targets for genetic engineering. Previous studies showed that, in plants subjected to hypothermic stress, transcriptomic analysis revealed a large number (>75%) of differentially expressed genes [13–15]. Despite these findings, only few of them were involved directly in cell elongation [14]. One of more prominent examples is that of CCT, a member of cysteine proteases found in all plants where it contributes to plasmodesmatal membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking [16]. Other than that CctA was recently identified as the core component of an allosteric protein complex that regulates cytoskeletal structure and cell size [17,18]. Thus, not only did hypoplasia lead to the appearance of new cell types"
"The Ecology and Epidemiology of Plague Introduction Throughout history, plague has been made infamous as the"," scourge of civilizations. Although its introduction to England in 1287 is the most notable historical connection, there have been many others, such as from the Middle Ages through World War I. The oldest record of the disease is dated to 1492, although it has long been known that it was endemic in western Europe. Many of these early epidemics were later identified as part of a natural disaster; plague is often attributed to the Black Death, which was thought to be caused by plagues of rats, fleas, and rats. In the last few centuries, the plague spread throughout Europe, North America, Africa, Australia, Oceania, Asia, eastern Africa and southeast Asia. Diseases that spread through populations and caused outbreaks were referred to as epidemiologists called pandemics. Other ancient accounts suggest that plague was introduced to Europe by two sea voyagers from Italy in the 10th century. Early European reports of plague are commonly referenced in medieval chronicles and medical literature. [1] The earliest references to plague in early modern Europe are found in English documents dating between the late 15th and early 16th centuries. These records include treatises, medical pamphlets, poetry, legal enactments, court cases, accounts of patients and rulers, wills, commercial contracts, insurance policies and legal codes. This paper will focus on the medieval records of four early outbreaks of pestilence: Leiden, Holland, London, Antwerp. Each outbreak was an epidemic that began with a large number of people infected with the virus, but did not spread widely. There were many similarities between these earlier events and the epidemiological characteristics of today’s current plague, so we can find similarities in each of their causes. Plague has several different forms, including classical, bubonic, pneumonic (flu-like illness), pneumotropic, septicaemic, pleuropneumonia, epizootic, zoonotic and epidemic. Classical plague (or puerperal fever) is one of three forms of diseases that cause fevers and chills during the third and fourth months of pregnancy. Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacterium causes a respiratory infection that results in pneumonia or severe pleurisy. A pneumo-pulmonary form of pneumothorax is seen more frequently than pleural pneumonitis, though neither condition is present in all patients. Both conditions require prompt surgical intervention. Severe bronchopneumonies may result in broncho-pleura separation, with air pockets and fluid surrounding the heart and lungs, resulting in life-threatening respiratory failure. Finally, other forms like leukosis, nephritis, arthritis, dermatitis and encephalitis appear in milder forms. One of only two clinical criteria for distinguishing classical plague from other types of pneumonia is that the patient is treated promptly with antibiotics. During this time, patients may recover, while others may die. Bubonic infections, especially in horses, can spread to humans, causing bacteremia, pneumonia, empyema, peritonitis or septicemia. Babies born with pleomorphic mycobacteriosis develop similar symptoms, as do individuals with leprosy, tuberculosis, or other chronic diseases. Acute, febrile infections may be accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension, headache, myalgia, arthralgia and fever. Occasionally, acute rheumatic fever, polymyalgia rachidata and systemic lupus erythematosus may also present with fever and skin lesions.[2]

LONDON – An epidemic of “pestilential” diseases reached London in January 1665, when a quarter of its population was infected. It killed upwards of 500,000 people, according to records at London's Whitehall Palace, where a team of experts was assembled to study the outbreak. Based on what they had found, scientists were able to predict that more than half of London would be infected within nine months. However, they warned, it could take up to eighteen months before the majority of those who contracted the illness were cured. More than a hundred years later, no one remembers if it took more or less than nine or eighteen month to clear the epidemic completely. What is clear is how quickly it spread.
A.K.S., Medical Students' Association, 1881
It was clear to Londoners that their city was being overrun by a new kind of disease. But how could the threat be contained? The answer lay in vaccination. By the end of July 1691, nearly 6,800 London children had received a course of inoculation, showing that they were immune against the new disease, called ‘pests.   In fact, over half the city had been protected by the year‟s vaccine,"
"HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS: ON THE PRESUMED SYMPATRIC SPECIATION OF VIDUA Introduction: Ernst Mayr once wrote, sympatric speciation is like the"," beginning of a novel in which you have not heard enough yet to know whether you love or loathe the novel at large. The hypothesis that different sexes are better suited to mate and reproduce than are the same sexes with different reproductive modes (e.g., hetereomorphs) seems attractive. In fact, recent studies on several animal and plant taxa suggest that this hypothesis can be correct. Many of these studies have focused on animals, such as the ant, which has long had the potential to produce more daughters than sons, and which was thought to be a sexually dimorphic species. But now that it has become a common sight, biologists have observed many examples of sympatic speciations where one sex (male) produces more offspring than another (female) does, often in the absence of any apparent genetic difference between the two. This is the kind of speciating that occurs in all vertebrate taxonomic groups except mammals, including all mammals except birds and reptiles. (See also: D.M.Gould, R.S.Jenson, K.E.Koch, E.Mayr, Sexual reproduction and speecing, Zoology 46:1-23, 1969). For example: 1) The lizard and bat males of the genus Anolis lizards have been observed to have more sons than daughters, although it is not clear why they should have done so. 2) Birds in several taxonomies (including songbirds) show female dominance, with the male being dominant when young and females being submissive when adult. 3) A number of plant species have showed the phenomenon of hybridization between species without any morphological evidence for introgression. 4) Many amphibians show the apparently paradoxical phenomenon called ""parasitism."" For instance, American pines (Pinus strobus) in North America (and eastern Asia), as well as other taxanders (Anura) and frogs (Odontophrynus), are known to parasitize each other, especially in western North American forests. And some treefrog families have hybridized, but without showing any phenotypic differences (see: J.Baehr, O.Hertlein, F.Reich, H.Taber, Sexually dimorhizal hybridisation in frogs of North Africa and Asia, Proceedings of IRE 9:129-146, 1961; J.-C.Lee, B.D.McElrath, Drosophila, sex ratio, speckling and diploidy, Nature 317:569-570, 1987; Baele & Breder, On sex ratios of trees, Science 232:1336-1339, 1986; Rüscheld, M.Vollers, J., Heteroplasia, hybrid evolution, evolution of sexual reproduction, Evolution 53:255-268, 1991). 5) Other groups of animals have sometimes shown the paradox that the sex of an individual, while not influencing the size of its offspring, can nevertheless influence its reproductive success by affecting the number and age of births (for example, in fishes). In other words, parents can influence the life-history of their offspring by selecting for either more or fewer children. More generally, the effect of parents on their kids is known as genetic inheritance. 6) Finally, there are a number cases in evolutionary biology that involve more complex patterns of interaction among the genes of different individuals. Not all such cases involve intersexual interactions, however. Some of them involve interactions between individuals of particular populations. For reasons that are complicated to explain, some intersex cases are difficult to interpret. Consequently, we have tried to focus on two sorts of interspecific interactions that may prove especially important for understanding specking. Our hypotheses are as follows. First, since sympatism occurs regularly in different taxon groups, it may be that mating systems that do not involve intraspecific interactions occur less frequently than do those that require intrastate interactions. Therefore, if interspecies mating were rare, interindividual mating might be more frequent. Second, because sympizing is particularly good at creating new genetic diversity (Z.P.Plasterk, L.R.Shafer, Sympatry and population diversification, Population Genetics 16:61-71, 1980), sympatrizing could be responsible for the origin of some new forms of life. Although the specific examples that we discuss are not the most spectacular, they serve to illustrate the general problem of explaining the emergence of new life forms through speaching. Given the obvious importance of this process, others who believe sympattically specing is responsible can make similar claims. However, until now, no one has suggested that sympatl"
"SENSORY DRIVE AND SPECIATION Do ecological constraints favour certain perceptual systems and, thus, generate"," a selective pressure favoring certain kinds of sensorimotor control? The sensory drive theory predicts that perceptual control should be favoured over sensor-motor conflict because of a perceptual bias towards the sensory input, which may create a conflictive relationship between the perceived task and the motor response required to accomplish the task. The specification hypothesis states that different sensory modalities induce different cognitive mechanisms that, in turn, cause a cognitive conflict between perceptual and sensoric information for each type of sensory feature. This hypothesis predicts both an ""ortho-divergence"", i.e., an increased influence of the olfactory sense on cognitive processes, when sensory features are processed from a specific sensory environment such as a perfume or a familiar object. In other words, sensory divergences should occur because the processing of these sensory inputs leads to a sensory conflict with the ongoing motor task (for a review, see [@B12]). Evidence for these predictions comes from studies on perceptual decisions, such us: *the ""decision to move""*. [Figure 1A](#F1){ref-type=""fig""} depicts the classical example of an attentional blink, where a second visual stimulus is available in order to reorient attention away from the first one. [Supplementary Videos S1--S3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0956797618801745) illustrate this phenomenon, showing two presentations of identical stimuli. Each stimulus requires a behavioral response, although the two stimuli differ in terms of their perceptual quality. If a participant has just responded to the second stimulus, the stimulus will no longer appear in the participant's visual field; but if participants have just detected the third stimulus by attending to it, then the subsequent stimulus appears in their visual fields. Note that the stimuli can be completely unrelated and still induce the same behavioral responses. Although the decision to change the response to one stimulus or another relies on sensory cues, not only on motor signals, it is based on a continuous assessment of perceptual input. Therefore, there is no motor conflict, because there was no previously perceived sensory evidence for a change in response. Consequently, no sensorically mediated perceptual conflict exists.

These stimuli activate a set of parallel neural circuits, whose goal is to produce the expected behavioral outcome. Any errors in processing these stimuli lead to erroneous predictions. For example, if the predicted outcome is that movement should take place after the presentation of odour, stimulation of parasympathetic afferents would be sufficient to trigger a reflexive movement (red arrow). However, since the observed physiological data do not support such an interpretation, additional processing steps are necessary to prevent this consequence.

PLANT POLLINATION SYSTEMS: EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN GENERALIZATION AND SPECIALIZATION Perhaps one of the most intriguing varieties of mutualism is," that involving plants. This form of plant-plant (or plant)-pollinator interaction has been extensively studied in terms of its evolutionary advantages over other possible interactions between plant and pollinating insects. The main focus has so far been on species whose flower visitation patterns are restricted to certain habitats, such as the one used by bees and foraging ants. In these systems, pollinators avoid visiting flowers with large volumes of nectar and pollen, avoiding the risk of being stung by pollen from other insects that are visiting the same flower. Another common feature is the avoidance of visiting large flowers, because they tend to attract larger pollinator numbers.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena. One theory is called 'the size principle' (e.g. [@b2]; [Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=""fig""}). The advantage of having flowers that rarely contain nectaries is twofold: first, the likelihood of encountering large amounts of pollen is reduced. Second, when a large number visit a flower, chances of them being pollinated increase. Other theories propose a'specialization' of insect foragers ([@h3]), or the existence of an optimal population size which maximizes the efficiency of resource exploitation ([Figures 1A,B](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxbi/dwq043/-/DC1)). While it is still controversial whether these mechanisms are necessary to account for the observed phenomenon, they seem to be sufficient to produce some of these results. Although the amount of pollination achieved by pollinatee depends on the pollinations strategy used, this is usually a factor of their relative abundance within the population. Therefore, for example, if a plant uses nyctinsectivory, its level of flower visiting should generally increase with the abundance of other floral visitors. Finally, there is evidence that pollens can benefit from a high-density of forager bees ([Figure 2](https://i.imgur.com/NX8HcVQ.jpg), [Table 1;](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?lvl=0&id=626545) [Appendix S1](Amp_files/app4_figs/721_tab1.zip) available in Dryad \[[@evx041-B72]\]). Pollen moths also seem likely to benefit in this sense ([Table 2; Appendix S2](aamp_v2.pdf)).
![Examples of processes giving rise to mutualistic species. (A) Size principle: plants with small flowers are able to obtain relatively few nociceptors from pollinees. Pollins are then less efficient polluptors, reducing the investment required to detect the pollen. Nectar sources are thus more limiting for flower visitors, who must devote more resources to finding food. Size reduction of flowers is particularly important for plants that do not flower all year round. Adapted from [Wright, 1998](website url: <https:/github.io/wright/mutualism/>). (B) Specialization: pollines specialize in flowers visited by particular types of visitors: some pollinivores may prefer large-volume flowers (foraging bees) and others small-size flowers. Such pollinarotations could also occur in plants where the presence of a second species is detrimental to survival. Not all pollinerotates depend on large quantities of water reserves. Some pollatories require a lot of energy to extract resources from their hosts. Small flowers may therefore be better suited to pollining by animals that require much lower amounts than their larger cousins. Additionally, some specific pollineries may benefit even when the target flower is sparsely distributed. Plants with high rates of reproduction may favour frequent visits by insect visitors that provide resources at a fixed rate. Consequently, flower visits may either be restricted or enhanced by seasonal fluctuations. Shading indicates different pollutive strategies. Low rates and small size flowers can be visited only by nimby polliners. Large size and frequent flowering plants can offer nimble pollinates that can take advantage both of low availability and of short durations. High pollinatory rate and large size can allow for efficient and swift pollen extraction. Both mechanisms may be important in different plant populations. For example floribunda, *Arnebia euchroma*, is highly nimbic and abundant in its natural habitat. It can therefore benefit greatly from the specialization of some insect pollinovers. Many of our examples are hypothetical. Note that the size of each flower"
"CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS, RECOMBINATION SUPPRESSION, AND SPECIATION: A REVIEW OF RIESEBERG (2001) The causal link between chromosomal rearrangements and speciation events is"," generally accepted to be a strong one, although it has been challenged by some investigators. The major aim of the present paper is to review the available data concerning the association between chromosome rearranged genes and evolutionarily conserved features. In particular, we will take the approach of identifying regions of conservability for each gene within eukaryotic genomes, and use phylogenetic trees to assess the extent of their conservation. These phylogenies then can be used to infer the origin of these regions, with the same approach that was used for genes in prokaryotes. Although the amount of available information on chromosome organization is limited, our review shows that there is a range of possible outcomes, implying that different scenarios may be compatible with different values of selection on specific genes. Our conclusions are as follows: It should be noted that this is only a review of what is available in the literature, rather than a complete review. More comprehensive reviews have been published previously, such as those by Jones (2003) and Stadler and Grosberg (2000), but they mainly focus on species-specific chromosomally organized genes, instead of on the connections between genes associated with speciations and the biological processes they encode. This review is aimed at raising awareness of this point, since it is clear that our understanding of genome evolution still leaves many open questions."
"ON THE ORIGINS OF MAN: UNDERSTANDING THE LAST TWO MILLION YEARS INTRODUCTION: In the past two decades, our understanding of the"," origin of life has expanded rapidly. The first signs that complex life could exist on Earth appeared in rocks that formed in shallow sea water at a time about 1 billion years ago. In fact, many young rocks were produced by volcanic eruptions or other extreme events. This rapid evolution is called “the Quaternary extinction event.” Extinctions of large numbers of species are known to be caused by asteroid impacts, volcanoes, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Many other possible factors have been proposed as contributing to this process. Among the most notable among them is the ‘great dying’ hypothesis, which posits that perhaps the earth‟s surface was significantly altered by some kind of natural catastrophe over a long period of time. Although the Quatertiary extinction would seem to point to some great catastrophe, it may instead be a natural event (e.g., volcanic or earthquake) that took place very early in the history of Earth. Recent discoveries have suggested that our planet had a relatively small impact on the early earth and that it was only later in its history that the big changes came about. Under this view, the last few million years are quite ordinary and can best be understood if we view it in terms of a „natural history“ rather than a catastrophic one. We need not imagine an ancient catastrophic event, such as the one hypothesized by modern theories of extinction, to understand the nature and origins of complex organisms. It is simply impossible to know the beginnings of all life-forms from the moment they first appeared on our earth. Therefore, for the purposes of this presentation, we will concentrate on what can be taken to represent the earliest stages of terrestrial life - simple multicellular algae.

THE AMONG THE ALGOTROPOLYS: SIMPLE MULTICELLULAR LAUGHS ARESIDAE
A. Overview of simple algal evolution
1. Evolution of multihyphal cells
Algae are multikinetic, multisubstrate organisms with well-developed cell walls and internal membranes. They are characterized by a large number of specialized tissues and organs, namely: (1) the vascular system, (2) endospores, those that give rise to vegetative structures, including the chlorophytes, mycophyte-like structures (M-form) and the heterocysts, when the cells are divided into two cells, each of which contains a spore; (3) spores, polyblastic, with the protoplasm being surrounded by two membranes (each with a specific function) named the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic membrane, respectively; and (4) colonies, composed of several hundred or thousands of cells forming a gelatinous, amorphous mass. Algae have a high degree of plasticity in their morphological structure. Through the application of certain genetic methods, scientists have successfully isolated the genes involved in different metabolic pathways. (For a review of these techniques see [5,6,13]). These genetically engineered algae serve as a powerful tool for investigating the physiology of single cells and for gaining insights into the fundamental principles underlying cellular processes. Based on these experiments, researchers have gained insight into general principles of cell communication through cell-cell signaling systems and into aspects of differentiation, development and growth control. However, although these algae are still very important in basic research, they are difficult to culture and manipulate experimentally. Moreover, their usefulness in biotechnology has not yet become fully exploited. Consequently, no real progress has been achieved in developing applications for these model organisms in medicine, agriculture and industry. 2. Multicellular development of A. oceanica
The early ancestors of green plants evolved from a common ancestor that was already present in space when Earth's atmosphere began to slowly fill the oceans. Some of those early plants, called holopelagic plants (for example Aphanizomenon oceanicum), developed into aerial plants that then gave rise directly to land plants. These plants lived in oceans throughout Earth‚s history and were particularly abundant in ancient shallow marine environments. Other early plant ancestors also existed in deep seas and shallow lakes, but they appear to have dispersed widely throughout the ocean and to diversified considerably more quickly than landward dispersals. Subsequently, plants started to move out of their deep marine habitats and spread to the surface during the Holocene period (approximately 10,000 years). The oldest remains of land-dwelling, plant-type organisms are found in cold environments such the Alps. Altogether, these early events occurred within the context of an extremely unstable Earth environment. Thus, various processes of environmental change were acting on living plants before the beginning of oxygenic photosynthesis. One of them was the effect of water flowing from warmer areas to"
Fetal Endocrine System Abstract This article reviews the effects that maternal nutrition can," have on the developing fetus. The effect of maternal hormones, especially those produced during pregnancy, on fetal development is reviewed. Recent data from in vitro and in vivo research are presented on what appears to be important factors in the programming of fetal programming for glucose tolerance and body composition. These include changes in brain development, myogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and secretion of insulin-like growth factors. Finally, the potential of gestational diabetes to cause long-lasting changes to the fetal phenotype is examined."
"Mn (III) TPPS4: A metallophorphryin used for tumor identification in MRI  From as early as 1948, scientists have studied the potential"," of using radiometal-containing molecules to identify tumors. This article examines how an MRI-based peptide can be used to detect tumors at different anatomic locations, such as the head, chest, liver and pelvis. The sensitivity and specificity of this approach were determined both experimentally and in a mouse tumor model. In addition, a human tissue-specific version of the peptides was generated and its applicability to MRI detection of tumor masses was tested. Based on the experimental results, the developed peptidomimetic strategy can potentially be applied not only to clinical MRI examinations, but also to molecular imaging studies in living subjects."
"Global reproductive strategies of Tursiops and Stenella (family Delphinidae) Introduction Generally, females make a larger investment toward future generations"," in terms of time, space, and energy. This investment may be manifested as a greater amount of investment into reproduction when females engage in long-term, intense mating activity with the male (e.g., [@pone.0050177-Hudson1], [Figure 1](#p one-0051177–g001){ref-type=""fig""}). Females also have an opportunity to invest more into offspring through investment in both the mother\'s own body and the parental care received from others during the mating season. Theoretically, the increased investment should translate to improved survival, especially for females that spend more time in close proximity to their mates. Given this theoretical link between mating behavior and survival it is important to test how individuals adjust their mating behaviors according to the sex of their offspring. In a number of species, such as that of Steno *et al.* [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0549-13.2010), male and female reproductive effort varies across offspring sexes, with females investing more in sons than daughters, presumably due to a selective pressure on survival.

Complementation Between Histidine Requiring Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Introduction Complementation experiments test for function. If two mutations separately," suppress a phenotype, then the two are said to be compatible. The approach is simple: one takes a strain with the mutation of interest, such as the one from a laboratory stock, and then checks whether the mutant can grow in the presence of histidine, a compound essential for yeast growth. This allows the authors to test the specific roles of the mutations. In some cases, complementation helps rule out the existence of a second mutation necessary for viability.

The work by Schmid et al., published online today in Molecular Evolution, reports an experimental proof that a histidinol-induced structural difference between Sacchromyces sensu stricto and Saccomycoccales sensutum causes the loss of function in response to histamine. (A histamino acid is one type of amine.) To find out, Schmid etal. compared histatin mutants of S. cerevifersus to their parental strain. They found that the histadine-synthesizing pathway was restored in several histazinc mutants, while the inability to synthesize histamines persisted. Further analysis showed that only two strains, each with a single point mutation, were unable to produce histamin in culture and were thus unable both to metabolize and accumulate histamins in vivo. Therefore, the absence of these two activities has allowed the cells to continue growing in a medium where histedogenis is required for growth; conversely, when the lack of this biosynthetic activity is removed, cells are able to grow normally but do not metabolise histivatediam. Although the most common cause of fungemia is the production of α- or β-hemolysins (and/or the formation of sulfides) in yeasts, it appears that more complex variations in metabolic pathways may be responsible for the same phenotype. [From Schmutz, H., Kalko, M., Schulz, D., Stadler, O., Steinberg, L., & Eisenfeind, R. E. 2006. Cell Cycle. 27(2):309–313. doi:10.1016/j.cellcyst.2006.04.005. PMID16404938]. Figure 4 illustrates how the deletion of either of two genes, DHPS1 and DHPGSR, leads to a loss-of-function phenotype because they are required solely for histamide synthesis. These two enzymes are involved in de novo synthesis of arginine and histagine respectively. Both of them are located on the chromosome and share the conserved amino acid motif (KVK) present in all other histahydrogenases. DHSP1 catalyzes the conversion of L-histidyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutaric acid and NADPH. It converts histodienes to tetrahydro histami acids by transferring a hydrogen atom from NADP+ to the carbon bonded to C-4 of serine. Recent mutagenesis experiments revealed that this enzyme functions exclusively in histasemim biosynthesis. Interestingly, this is unlike the other two histaines, which are produced through a similar reaction catalyzed by another histanase, namely DHGP. However, although both enzymes use the ATP-Mg2+ couple for their activity, they exhibit distinct specificity for particular amino acids attached to these nucleotide molecules, with DHGPS being specific for L-[His4]Ser and HDSPS functioning better than DHGR toward the L-(His5)Ser substrate. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that different aminoacid sequences are responsible of their specific recognition and that differences in aminoacids attached also exist. Our results indicated that four substitutions have caused the observed effect, three of which occur at position His5 and one at Cys27. Additionally, replacement of C29 by a tyrosine residue increases the activity toward LH-L-(Thr5)-Ser. Finally, introducing an alanine at the position Lys30 reduces the efficiency of DHGE in producing LN-(Leu5), a substrate of HGS, suggesting that Lys 30 may participate in determining the specificity of GHES activity. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that histoinositol and its intermediates are the natural substrates for DHGI and GHSE and establish a direct link between the biosilica of fungi and the mechanism of action of cysteine proteases in prokaryotes. We suggest that modification of certain amino acidic residues of proteins, especially those close to hemes, may play an important role in conferring the distinctive ability of some fungi to circumvent the otherwise well-evident histotoxicity of nitrogenous compounds. For example, changes in positions 26 and 33 of yeast DHPP would allow it to recognize"
Nest Selection in Weaver Birds Introduction All bird species reproduce through the use of a," clutch of eggs, each laid by a female before she lays her next. The process is called “nest selection” and can occur naturally in birds as well as by artificial mechanisms. In nature, eggs are selected for several reasons: small size, ease of manipulation during incubation, appearance, and ease to transport. Small eggs will lay smaller clutches, since they are easily handled. Eggs may also be more prone to survival. Large eggs that lay multiple clutters make for easy transportation, but they reduce survival chances due to the potential for multiple deaths when an egg is laid. Many methods of nest selection involve manipulation of the environment such as feeding food to induce incubating parents to lay their own eggs. This natural selection on eggs makes them useful for many breeding purposes, such things as the mating of birds and the breeding of animals. A similar process occurs with insects, which often use eggs to attract new hosts. However, because eggs take a relatively long time to produce and are difficult to manipulate, artificial selection of eggshells to increase their survival becomes more common in modern times. EGG SELECTION OF WEAVER BIRDS An egg selection system is one where birds are able to breed without having to find their way out of their egg shells. Egg selection is used in both wild and domestic environments. It is particularly useful in wild species, who must travel from place to place in search of an available clutch. Some species are good candidates for egg-selection because they tend to move slowly in the natural environment and frequent areas with few available nest sites. Therefore, egg availability is critical to their success in finding a mate. Other species have a strong desire to mate with the same sex, especially in larger populations, so they need to be able hatch their eggs quickly. Both species require a large number of males in order to successfully breed, although male bird population size is only slightly related to egg abundance. Most egg choice systems have evolved to optimize for one reason or another. For example, some species display special behaviors directed toward selecting eggs in favor of particular sex. These behaviors include ‘cuckoo eggs’, ’catering eggs at nests‘, or � 'nesting eggs' (and later 'caring eggs'). In some cases, it may be a matter of survival; the male would not be successful at reproducing if his mate was unavailable. Under this scenario, the female would be unable to obtain a suitable male partner even if available. Although the majority of these systems operate on a random basis, others do work within some kind of hierarchy. An individual bird's fitness is measured in terms of its ability to raise offspring. Birds in a hierarchy usually have high fitness if they raise better than average offspring, whereas lower fitness individuals rarely raise well. Because of this, hierarchical selection tends to favor the most successful birds. When a bird takes a specific action, like choosing an optimal nesting location, its reproductive success is improved. Aspects of life-history theory suggest that individuals will respond to changes in environmental conditions by altering their gene expression patterns, hence changing their phenotypes. More generally, changes to gene activity levels may ultimately lead to differences in life histories. Evolutionary biologists have observed that different strategies can evolve in response to environmental changes. One of those strategies involves egg production. Numerous studies have shown that, under some circumstances, birds produce eggs when they should not. Such behavior is sometimes considered ‿paradoxical‟ or 'counter-adaptive', because it is seen as a survival tactic, presumably against predators. Another strategy involves switching egg color, for example from brown or orange to blue or purple. Again, other studies indicate that birds attempt to modify their phenotype, though not in such drastic ways. Recent evidence shows that the trait 'blue color' has undergone positive selection pressure. Blue color is associated with good foraging success, higher survival probability, increased nest success rates, enhanced learning abilities, reduced brood loss, improved forage efficiency, no effects on survival and brood size compared to brown color. [2] A final strategy, called'reproductive behavior' in some studies, involves changing the shape of body feathers, possibly in an effort to enhance plumage traits. Studies of insect flight have suggested that feather variation plays an important role in reproduction. Changes in feather shapes could lead flies to adopt a different behavior, reducing the risk of being caught in their web. Feathers are also known to play a role via the wing morphologies in male songbirds. Increased variation in wing shape appears to correlate with increased sperm production in songbird males [3, 4]. However the relationship between changes made to feathers and changes brought about by selection remains poorly understood, until now. Nest selection has developed into a common strategy used by many wild birds, including owls, woodpeckers, kestrels, skylarks"
Fungal Eye Infections Due to ReNu MoistureLoc Introduction Numerous types of fungi are able to infect the," ocular surface. The main causative agents are ascomycetes and basidiomycota. Most cases of fungal eye infections are associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis or ophthalmic aspergillosis. Other causes include traumatic and iatrogenic, neoplastic, and autoimmune.

Ocular AsperginismOfloxacineye infections caused by fungi that live in the environment have a worldwide distribution. Common causes are Candida species and Asporindis. In some cases, fungi can be isolated from the corneas, iris, conjunctival tissue, or other parts of the eye. Antifungals are available for several types. Although the majority of cases can respond to treatment, serious adverse effects such as endophthalmitis and malignancy have been reported. Use of topical antifluoroquinolones should be restricted in cases involving ophtalmological injury and systemic candidemia. Complications may include end-stage renal disease and potentially life-threatening pneumonitis. Erythematous, hemorrhagic, ulcerating, erosion-type lesions on the anterior and posterior parts occur frequently. Conjunctivitis, blepharitis due to local or systemic irritation, uveitis secondary to immunosuppression, osteomyelitis following dental procedures, periorbital cellulitis leading to infection of orbital muscles, tarsorrhoea, mycotic cilia, chronic myositis syndromes, acute suppurative otitis media, retinal vein occlusion, aphthous stomatitis (and later on), and cutis vertica alba (including necrotizing fasciitis) have also been described. Fungi may also cause other systemic diseases such an acute myocardial infarction and bacterial endocarditis.(1)
“Fumigant,” as a name for antiseptics, was coined by Dr. Joseph Gillman, who first used it in 1869 to refer to certain disinfectants that destroy the bacteria causing tuberculosis. Many other antisespirits were developed using fumigation as the target; these included isopropyl alcohol and nitrite. More generally, there is much interest in using nonirritating antifeases as part of a more environmentally friendly method of disinfection. This would be a less costly and safer method than the use of strong irritants such boric acid or chloroform.(3) However, when used on contact lenses, such antileaching agents may damage them. Therefore, it has been suggested that a fustrated agent (e.g., a silver or gold complex) be used instead of an antisynthetic fungicide. One such system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,557 to Williams et al. (Williams).
A fusible antibacterial compound for treating osmotically sensitive areas, especially those containing bacteria, viruses, prions, toxins, endotoxins, etc. is disclosed in PCT International Publication No WO 03/041272. Specific examples include: poly(amino acids); polyglycols; polyphenols; proteins; lactic acids; glycosaminoglycans; hydroxynaphthalene; triazinediones; dyes; and polymers having ionic groups such N-substituted phenols, sulfonamides, quaternary ammonium compounds, polyamines, carboxylic acids, amines, fatty acids and imides. Preferred methods of treatment include applications to the user's head, face, nose, anus, mouth, vaginal area, eyes, hands, feet, arms, chest, extremities, genitalia, shoulders, back, abdomen, hips, buttocks, knees, ankles, ankle and foot, inner ear, nasogastric and perirectal areas. These active compounds may be applied to one or more surfaces of humans and animals, including all surfaces exposed to outside ambient air, preferably through vapor phase deposition. Such methods include, for example, aerosol spray; impregnation; infusion; coating; lotion; gel; paste; spray application; pressurized spray device; microwave; heat; high frequency; electromagnetic radiation; ion bombardment; chemical vapor deposition; photolysis; plating; flame; radiant; plasma; ink; paint; enameling; or any combination of these techniques. A number of delivery vehicles are useful including but not limited to liquid, powder, cream, lotions and sprays. Administration to mucous membranes may produce absorption in both mucus and epithelium. Methods of application are well known in themselves"
Plant Biodiversity I. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity can be simply defined as," the abundance or diversity of species in a community, such as a plant community. The notion of biodiversity is extremely useful when we think about the potential to manage the natural world. In order to understand what biodiversity means, scientists have historically referred to the diverse assemblages of living organisms (e.g., plants, fungi, invertebrates) present in any given place. This so-called macroscopic diversity (i.e., species richness) reflects the existence of a large number of functionally distinct species. Many of these are difficult to study but they do exist and represent an important resource for scientists. Macroscopically diverse communities also demonstrate significant differences in the biological structures, functions, and rates of growth and turnover of their members. Although the term “macroecological” has several different meanings, the most common application refers to patterns found in ecosystems spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales.

Biodiverse regions are those that include multiple different types of plant, animal, or micro-invertebrate communities. Due to their complex structure, biodiversity studies typically use taxonomic groups, often described by taxa, to describe communities across the landscape. Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing and genotyping technology have opened up a new possibility for biodiversity research, namely, ‘taxon identification’. More specifically, researchers can now identify the specific taxon(s) that comprise the biodiversity of an ecosystem at a particular location, called species level. Species identification has many applications, not the least of which is the ability to monitor ecological trends at finer scales within ecosystems. For example, when looking at an old field system, biologists can look for trends in species abundance and composition over time. Monitoring biodiversity allows researchers to assess the current state of the environment and to predict its future development. Additionally, monitoring biodiversity can help with the conservation of certain biodiversity hotspot environments. One of our goals in managing biodiversity in agriculture is to preserve the diversity and integrity of habitats that provide the majority of agricultural products used globally each year. Therefore, we seek to protect the habitat for all native species, including those currently under threat because of overpopulation and climate change. Our goal is that biodiversity and its associated ecosystems will be maintained and managed in such a way that ensures that future generations will continue to benefit from the healthy functioning of ecosystems in agricultural landscapes. Thus, conservation planning should begin with identifying the land cover type(es) in which the resources are most abundant, with this knowledge then informing the management strategy for these habitats. Ultimately, maintaining the variety of life supporting ecosystems is critical to agriculture‟s survival. By focusing on preserving biodiversity, agriculture will increase its ability function and maximize productivity. Agricultural biodiversity management strategies should ensure that local, regional, national, global, inter-continental, economic, environmental, social, cultural, religious, legal, educational, policy, legislation, international, traditional, local and indigenous people have the opportunity to access and use food and other produce.


A. Overview of Plant Biotechnology Technology
Researchers in several countries, led by Canada and Brazil, have begun to explore the application of new plant biotechnology tools. Research on biotechnologies aimed at expanding crop productivity has focused primarily on the use of genetically engineered transgenic genes introduced into crops through traditional methods such breeding, plant breeders, tissue culture techniques, hybridization, transgenics and gene transfer. Other research has employed a variety approaches, from using natural selection to genetic engineering, pollinating insects with genetically modified crops, modifying bacteria and viruses, selecting for traits in plants using molecular biology techniques and creating genetically altered crops with various combinations of genes. Not all research focuses exclusively on altering existing genetic diversity in crops. Rather, some research aims to modify plant genomes, especially those whose function is not well understood, for example: pest and pathogen resistance, enzyme synthesis, hormone signaling, protein structure and stability, stress tolerance and nutrient uptake. There are numerous other potential applications for biotic and abiotic factors that influence plant growth, development, water relations, nutrient fluxes and yield. These include the production of pharmaceuticals, hormones, pigments, industrial chemicals, agrochemicals, biocarriers, pesticides, biomaterials and bioremediation. Given the wide range and increasing prevalence of problems caused by soil and environmental degradation, it is clear that more research is needed to develop innovative tools that enhance plant productivity and resilience to adverse conditions. A number options are available for increasing the productivity of plants. Some of them involve enhancing the efficiency of biomass accumulation in photosynthesis, enhancing seed production, promoting stomata to open, improving nutrient acquisition, increasing tolerance to drought and heavy metal stress, preventing post-harvest decay, providing protection against pathogens, extending the duration of crop flowering and fruit ripening, reducing pest damage, accelerating plant reproduction, stimulating flower formation"
Malaria Disease and Transmission Malaria is the disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the," genus Plasmodium that primarily infects humans. The disease is endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia, but is increasingly spreading throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Most human infections occur following mosquito bites, although person-to-person transmission also occurs through transplacentally acquired infection during labor and delivery, perinatal transmission (e.g., from mother to infant), sexual transmission, blood transfusion and organ transplantation, organ donation, and contact with the environment such as water contaminated with oocysts shed by infected mosquitoes. Although the most severe forms of malaria have been historically associated with tropical areas, the majority of cases now occur in temperate and temperatrous regions of Europe, North America, Australia, South America and Africa. In areas where mosquito vectors do not exist, such transmission is uncommon.
The disease can spread rapidly through populations if it can be maintained over a long period of time. This is particularly true of diseases that cause severe disease in pregnant women, newborn infants and immunocompromised patients. Early symptoms of infection include fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhages, chest pain, headache, joint pain or bone pain. Fever is typically accompanied by headache and cholera-like jaundice. Signs of severe malaria include respiratory distress, convulsions, coma, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia and shock. Severe disease may result in hemoglobinuria, hemoconcentration, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, pulmonary edema, acute renal colic, increased cardiac output and hyperpyrexia. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe form of disease are associated more frequently with poor health status than with any specific etiology. Consequently, death rates for malaria are still high despite widespread availability of effective malaria control measures. Thus, there is a need for improved therapies for combating and preventing malaria. Such therapies should be available in low cost and easy to administer and use, preferably without side effects, especially in developing countries where malarial incidence is high. There is also a continuing need to identify compounds useful in treating malaria that inhibit the replication of these parasites, including those of particular relevance to human therapy, namely P. falciparum. Finally, development of novel therapies is greatly desired, since new drugs will provide efficacious and safer therapies, reduce morbidity and mortality rates, facilitate monitoring of drug resistance, enable large-scale distribution of drugs, ease the burden on hospitals and medical care facilities, make it easier to diagnose and treat infections, prevent transmission of resistant parasites from infected individuals and reduce the potential for global epidemics. Therefore, continued efforts to discover new treatments for diseases caused predominately by parasites of human origin are essential. [unreadable] [u] Discovery and characterization of a novel target protein for antimalarial drugs: Identification of an inhibitor of PfHRP2, a member of serine protease superfamily, whose function has not been previously attributed to this family of enzymes. Specific Aim 1: To characterize the structural features of Pv HRP inhibitors that are responsible for their activity. Through site-directed mutagenesis and structural biology, we will define a set of conserved amino acids that serve as the basis for designing an HRPI inhibitor. Our hypothesis is that the inhibitor is an allosteric modulator that binds to a site distinct from that involved in HRPA and HRPB inhibition. We will use structure-based approaches to test this hypothesis. Using our data derived from mutational and biophysical studies, molecular modeling, docking, substrate binding and inhibition assays, compound specificity will be determined. Molecular dynamics simulations will elucidate the mechanism of HRPs inhibition and identify important structural elements that stabilize the binding of inhibitors. Additionally, biochemical assidings will assess the biological activity of candidate compounds. Protein engineering will produce variants of putative active compounds that retain the ability to inhibit Pf HRPP2. These will then be used to generate a panel of potentially potent and specific inhibitors of this enzyme. Based on the data obtained, results from these assidsns will guide the selection of optimal inhibitors for in vitro and in vivo studies. Antimicrobial activity and structure/activity relationships of some of our compounds will also be assessed against selected strains of P hfRP2 and other members of its group. Targeting of naturally occurring pathogens with novel lead compounds; e. g., malaria parasites and bacterial toxins; will proceed in parallel. Experimental design will yield compounds with high potency and selectivity for Pf hRP 2. Both screening and synthesis of candidates will take place in a single platform facility at a pharmaceutical company. Strategies to circumvent the resistance problem will follow from the successful development and validation of compounds based on known mechanisms. Ultimately, these compounds should prove"
Role of Leptin in Cardiovascular Disease Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has an enormous impact on global," health. The metabolic dysregulation that accompanies obesity is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides (TGs), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and increased CVD risk. Both hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are associated with the development of CMD, especially in the absence of obesity. In particular, hypertriglyceridemic states, such as those seen in metabolic syndrome, can lead to coronary artery disease. Leptins are the most abundant proteins in plasma and tissues. Studies suggest that Lepin 2 promotes the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages via activation of STAT3 and that it has anti-inflammatory properties. However, little is known about the expression of leptin in peripheral tissues and cells and its ability to modulate the inflammatory process. Given the pivotal role that leptin plays in energy homeostasis, we hypothesize that there is an important functional link between leptin and the cardiovascular system, contributing to the observed association between obesity and CMA. Therefore, this study will investigate the potential role of leptin as a key player in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and determine the mechanism(s) through which leptin modulates the response to vascular injury. Specific Aim 1: To characterize the effect of exogenous leptin on vascular inflammation using cultured endothelium from rat thoracic aortas. [Aims:]{.ul}: (1) Determine whether leptin inhibits the migration and proliferation of THP-1 cells stimulated by thrombin, (2) explore the effects of down-modulating leptin expression on endotoxin-induced inflammation, focusing on eNOS phosphorylation and NO production,and (3) determine whether up-regulating or down regulating leptin affects the cytokine profile induced by LPS. These studies are designed to test the hypothesis that activated leukocytes contribute to atherogenesis and vascular dysfunction by increasing endotoxaemia. This project is the first to investigate whether exogenously administered leptin can modulated the vascular inflammatory response. Furthermore, since leptin is expressed in both adipose tissue and blood vessel wall, our preliminary data suggests that endotracheal administration of peptide would be sufficient to alter the circulating levels of this hormone. Our studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which lepine can modify vascular function and identify the specific tissues that are regulated by leptin. Relevance: Obesity and other metabolic diseases are characterized with increased levels TGs, low HDL-C levels and reduced antioxidant defenses. Obesity is associated more frequently with CArdial disease including stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although the underlying mechanism is not completely understood, some investigators have suggested that obesity may trigger the release of several cytokines and pro-oxidants, leading to endotoxic state and further cardiovascular disease progression. Many of these cytoktes have been attributed to adipocytes. Other investigators believe that obese individuals may also have an impaired nitric oxide bioavailability resulting in reduced cardiovascular protection. Based on our studies, it is proposed that factors released by fat cells are responsible for the increased inflammatory status in obese subjects, while others derived from adipocyte are likely to be responsible of the reduced nitrosative pathways. Thus, the goal of future experiments will be to understand the role played by these two different cellular sources of inflammatory mediators in determining the risk for cardiovascular diseases."
Mammal Diversification ABSTRACT: The advent of molecular clocks has created a rift," between the natural and the mathematical clock. In this paper, I argue that it is biologically important to understand when and why a biological clock transitions into a molecular clock, and to what extent the molecular age of an individual is affected by its genetic structure. I also discuss how recent findings on human genome structure can be used to predict when a human’s clock is undergoing a transition. Finally, since the majority of people have a slightly different genetic sequence from that of their nearest relatives, it becomes important not only to study the effect of changes in gene sequence on clock rates, but to investigate whether there are other biological factors that could also affect clock times. This paper is the first in a series that aims to explain the origin of a clock by incorporating a more complex model of genetic inheritance.

Introduction
============
(1)
A molecular (DNA or protein) clock gives scientists a way to measure the time-scale of the earth‘s rotation around its axis. The clock assumes that the rate of change in the amount of DNA inherited from a mother with a given set of chromosome number is proportional to the length of time since fertilization; that is, the clock “measures” the number of generations since a parent‟s egg divided by the sum of his/her chromosomes. (2) If the mother″s eggs are mated with the father′s sperm, then the daughter will inherit a mixture of chromosomes from both her mother and father, with approximately equal proportions of each. Therefore, we expect that, if the sex of individuals is known, they should show the same relationship between their lengths of nuclear DNA and their ages as the maternal lineage. But some mammals show different results. For example, chimpanzees have an accelerated rate at which they grow old \[1\], while elephants do not \[[2]{}\]. The reason for these differences is unknown. Both the chimpanzee and elephant show high rates of growth and a reduced rate in aging \,[3,4\]. These differences may result from differences in their genetic makeup. Differences in DNA content and in genes controlling growth rate and aging rate exist in humans \.[5\] Although the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mammalian populations varies widely \cite{}, the most significant differences appear to be found in regions of low recombination \cvite{\ref{viz}}. As suggested by these results, population genetics likely plays an important role in determining when the two species come into synchronization. More generally, inter-specific variation may also lead to differences between species. Mammals are phylogenetically related, though not closely related; they belong to different clades. Clade C, such as primates, birds, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and mammals, shows a wide range of body size and body shape \[""Vidakovic & Krmpotić""\]: apes, dolphins, elephants, marsupials, monkeys, humans, bats, seals, whales and shrews. Many of these clade differences are probably related to their specific evolutionary history. Large-bodied vertebrates such porpoises, for example (mackerels), are derived from sea elephants. Smaller species are considered to have evolved from ancestral types. Phylogenetic analysis of fossil species allows the reconstruction of past evolutionary relationships based on fossils. Although fossil records of mammals are fragmentary, there is evidence for much older mammalian groups such zonation patterns, suggesting a large time gap between mammal and early tetrapod groups \['Kuske\][6].
It is increasingly clear that natural selection plays a major role underlies species‴ evolution. Evolutionary models suggest that species belonging to distinct cladistic lineages will respond to similar selective pressures. Molecular clocks are particularly useful in studying adaptation in different species because they estimate the relative rates at various time scales. They can therefore be tested for deviations from expected rates. Consequently, molecular research has developed rapidly. Almost all molecular studies have been done on humans. Recent works have focused on other mammalian clasps, namely: bats (e.g., civets, macaques, fruit bats), horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs, tigers, wolves, bears, cats and primates (elephants, ruminant, primates). Even though no quantitative data are available on the characteristics of nonhuman animals, those studies provide useful insights. Studies of deer and wolves showed that they share many similarities with humans in terms of ecology, social organization and diet \""[@Hudson]"". Other studies on bats showed the potential of comparative analysis for understanding their evolution \"" [@Banks]. Despite these developments, questions still persist about the role of selection in evolution, especially in smaller mammals. Most studies use models of speciation and"
Malaria Disease and Transmission I. Malaria Disease and Transmission Malaria is a parasitic protozoa," disease affecting more than 2 million people each year throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. In addition to being a serious public health problem, malaria also poses a significant economic burden. The disease is endemic in all tropical areas of Africa and Asia, and its incidence has increased in many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years. More than 450 million individuals worldwide are infected with the malaria parasite. Although the disease can be prevented by the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, other means of preventing infection are being studied. Many of these methods involve the treatment of patients with antimalarial drugs that provide some degree of immunity to reinfection. Other strategies for preventing human malaria include the application of vaccines, such as those containing sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum (P. fal.) or P. vivax (Mabuia, R. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996, 93, 7498-7502). These vaccines may prevent the development of an active infection in the majority of individuals, but they do not prevent transmission of malaria from person to person.
Malariasis is caused by PlASMODIUM which infects human hosts. Parasites cause disease when they invade host red blood cells and multiply within the red cell. This invasion is facilitated by a specialized organelle called the rhoptries which reside on the surface of most red cells. These organelles have an elaborate system of microtubule-associated proteins that allow the parasites to move very quickly across the plasma membrane. Once inside the infected red erythrocyte, the parasite migrates through the cytoplasm to reach the nucleus and differentiate into gametocytes. Gametocyte formation occurs via the meiotic process in which a fertilized zygote buds from a mature red sialotelike parasite, called a sporocyst. Under certain conditions, this sporogenous form, which contains male and female gamete spores, can develop into oocysts. Oocytic parasites develop within mosquito salivary glands and then are transmitted to the mammalian host via mosquito bites. After several days, ookinetes rupture releasing ooze which invade the mosquito's midgut epithelium where they undergo maturation and produce sporulated ooxynidia. Finally, mature ootypes are ingested by phagocytosing macrophages which in turn become transformed into sporothermal forms that cause infection. Control of human malariases is mainly accomplished by two means: (1) the administration of a drug known as primaquine, a compound that interferes with DNA synthesis during the replication of nucleic acids, especially RNA, therefore blocking the growth and development stages; and (2) insecticides that interfere with ocoid development. Neither of which is currently approved for clinical use, although primquine is one of several drugs under investigation. Primaquin has proven to be a promising anti-malarial agent, since it has been shown to arrest parasite growth in both laboratory and in vivo studies, with no evidence of toxicity (A. Sillanpaa, K. Seidman, A. M. Raghuram, T. L. Wood, D. E. Smith, F. Ainslie, H. Haddaway, E.-M. Hill, P.-C. Gu, L.-B. Lin, O. Niederhoffer, S. Pappas, J. Parry, M.-F. Raoult, G. Richards, Drugs 45, 469-497 (2000)). Furthermore, primoquine has the potential to prevent human infections by interrupting the life cycle of PPR-1, an ooid-stage stage of Malonema malonense. Due to its low cost, limited toxicity and relatively high efficacy against malarial parasites, it is the only drug currently under clinical development that has undergone phase I/II clinical trials (Baccigalupi, I., Fares, B., Rousselle, C., Maisonneuve, V., Houdin, Y., Agirre, U., Euch, N., Allaouchié, É., Aucouturier, X., Tasset, Z. (1999) [Clinical trials of primocline]. Drugs, 47, 907-918).
A need exists for compounds that inhibit the activity of MALONEMA malodorum, for the prevention of malignant disease caused respectively by Malonia malannah, Malona glaziovii, or Malone mexicana. There is also a need for methods of treatment using such compounds."
A Case for a US International Anti-Malaria Program I. Malaria Disease and Transmission Malaria is a disease caused," by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, with the most significant risk being seen in areas with intense malaria transmission such as areas of urbanized villages in Africa and Southeast Asia. In these areas, malaria symptoms appear in childhood, and can develop into severe forms of illness in otherwise healthy adults. These include anemia, wasting, seizures, coma, convulsions, rashes, bone infection, arthritis, chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, poor growth, liver damage, acute respiratory failure, myocarditis, pulmonary edema, thrombocytopenia, hepatic failure and death from septicemia and encephalopathy (Mills et al., 1987, Science 236:1430; Muller, 1988, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 306:1; Mills etal., 1990, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 37:355; Schmid eta. 1986, Am. J. Public Health 88:1329; Miller etat. 1982, JAMA 246:1923; Sankar etad. 1985, Infect. Immun. 48:988; Slifstein etel. 1987 Pediatr. Nephrol. 2:24; Stadler etadel. 1988 Clin. N. Amer. 22:5; Stoops etd. 1983 Jl. Parasit. 98:47; Sunagawa etud. 1989, Clin Virol 4:157; Tanigawa, 1991, Drugs 53:109).
Malariasis, also referred to as malaria, affects over 1 billion people world-wide. Although the disease can be controlled through the use of insecticide drugs, such control measures have not been generally successful, especially in regions where many malaria infections are sustained through prolonged periods of exposure to parasites. Therefore, there is great concern regarding the continuing transmission of malaria which is the cause of more than 1.2 million deaths annually (WHO, 1989 Malariagen Epidemiol Rev 6:93; WHO, 1993 Malarid Res 9:71). There are currently no specific treatments for malaria that are effective in the treatment of severe cases. Recent efforts to develop chemotherapeutic agents have met with only marginal success, although one such drug has recently been developed (NTP, 1994). Moreover, when used in chemoprevention, chemo-protective agents alone are only moderately effective.
Antibiotic therapy and antiparasitic therapy are the only two effective methods of treatment for the long-term control of plasmo-infected individuals. For example, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and primidone are recommended for control purposes (Kemp et at., 1975, Lancet 1:1127; Burd et el., 1980, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32:828). However, since chlorquine has been widely used against parasitic diseases for many years, it has undergone extensive testing for antimalarial activity in different animal models. Chloroquines effectiveness has thus far been limited to artemisinin or artemether combination therapies. This drug class has not provided satisfactory results for controlling malaria in humans. More recent trials have indicated that it may be necessary to combine chlorquinine with one of several other antileishmanial agents, namely, amodiaquosine/artesunate, mefloquinate, quinacrine, primaquine or chlorantranilipride, to obtain greater antiamycobacterial activity (Zeng etn., 1992, Abstract presented at XVIIth Annual Conference of The World Health Organization, Geneva, 30 October 1992). These combinations may prove useful for preventing and treating malaria (R. S. Baker et n., 1995). Nevertheless, these compounds still do not provide adequate control in any situation. Other antibiotic compounds such mesaconazole and fluconazol show only short term activity, while they remain toxic for prolonged use, because they induce cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions. (See also, Kornblum et y., 1997, Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs 8:991). It is known that the administration of a combination of an anti-malarial agent with a CYP inducer results in higher levels of drug metabolism and higher concentrations of metabolites in plasma (D. R. Nelson et d., 1993, Biochim Biophyse. 66:145; F. C. Yoder et e., 1996, Drug Metab Dispos. 25:159). If a patient is taking an inductive CYPAG substrate, this will increase the amount of CYPLs metabolized by that CYPs. Increased levels and accumulation of these CYPC"
Varying infectivity of Diplostomum flexicaudum in fish species of Douglas Lake The metacercarial stage of Diplostomum sp. causes a disease in," fishes and its infection levels fluctuate seasonally. In this study, we examined the infective status of these stages in three fish groups of four fish types: American eel (Anguilla rostrata), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and rock bream (Pungitius pungitu). Diem was significantly more infectible in rock than in other fish. The infectivities of stages 3 and 4 were greater in common than American carp, but less so in all other groups. Differences among the three groups were also observed with respect to their relative infectibility of stage 1. American gar and common gar were more susceptible than both American and European carp to infection with the fourth stage. This finding indicates that different host species may provide different susceptibility to Diabrosis sp., or that the intensity of the secondary infection depends on the specific species. These findings also suggest that D. flexicolens may represent an intermediate host for Dirofilaria immitis."
Malaria in the Twenty-first Century I. Malaria Disease and Transmission Malaria is caused by a," member of the genus Plasmodium that contains a variety of genetically and antigenically distinct species. The major types of malaria parasite, PlA, P. falciparum, and P bovis are responsible for causing almost all malaria infections. More than 100 million cases of severe malaria are reported each year with 1.8 million deaths annually (WHO/malaria fact sheet, 1994). PbA and PlP represent the most common types found worldwide. Both types are transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes and are the only two species of anopheline mosquito responsible as the natural vectors of these two plasmo parasites (Munasinghe and Kumar, 1988).
Malarial infection results from a combination of several factors. One of which is the presence of a parasite infected red blood cells. In particular, malarial parasite growth is greatly enhanced in host RBCs (Bhat and Sharma, 1996). Another factor that promotes malariasis is that high-density, long lived, infected erythrocytes can adhere to surfaces of tissues and organs and produce more micro-organisms (Kumar et al., 1987). These microorganism can grow into parasites and cause disease. Therefore, preventing human exposure to malaria through preventative measures is extremely important.
Another factor promoting malady is lack of immunity to this parasite. This lack results in immune system failure to resist the infection. Furthermore, since antibodies to these parasite antigens are present in plasma, patients will have a high prevalence of infection even when there is no active infection (Zhou and Chabris, 1984). Moreover, increased parasitaemia and severity of disease are associated with the frequency of blood transfusion (Lee, 1991). There is increasing evidence that immunosuppression is one of risk factors for development of malignancy and its consequences. It has been shown that HIV+ patients had lower white blood cell counts and higher percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD4+ T cell surface antigen than did control subjects (Jain etal., 1990). They also had reduced CD2+CD5+ lymphocyte counts (Gentile etaal, 1990), and a greater percentage expression of membrane IgM on peripheral blood leukocytes. (Olivieri etd., 1997). Furthermore they had a reduced absolute lymphocytic count (Pallares et, 1998) and increased proportion of T3+ cells (Blair et at., 1995). The incidence of certain cancers has increased over time, suggesting a possible link between AIDS and malignant disease (Weber etet al, 1999). Immunosupression leads to disruption of cellular immunity and decreases production of immunoglobulin and antibody specific to malaria antigeon proteins. Many of them are also known to be elevated in AIDS patients (Pal etat, 1997), including those infected with Plp (Haase et it, 1995; Han etut, 1993). Individuals with AIDS have increased levels of interleukin-1 and interferon gamma (IL-I and IFN gamma) in their sera (Tremolet etad., 1996; Heine etud, 1992). IL-lg may be linked to susceptibility to chronic infections because IL lg increases superoxide formation in neutrophils (Van der Velde et eal.., 1986). In addition, elevated levels were detected in HIV infected patients compared with controls (He et ese, 1989). An elevated concentration of IL10 was also observed in serum of patients with malary syndrome (Caccamo etel, 2008). Human IL12 p40 is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes and is involved in regulation of Th1 response to viral infections (Shan et ass, 2002). Similar observations were made in chimpanzees infected by Schistosoma mansoni (Alam et en., 2000). Increased levels and numbers of activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphoblasts were found in peripheral lymph nodes of Schimpanopius (Parrot et ad, 2000) infected children and adults (Barbareschi et el., 2003). For example, in schistosemic patients, the number of CD3+, CD19+, and CD25+ activated lymphoid cells was significantly increased compared to healthy individuals (Sztajger et h, 2001). Higher levels B cell proliferation, immunoreactivity for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFR-associated Factor-alpha) receptors, perforins, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- l), E-selectin, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), CD14 and complement C3a protein were observed after schizont rupture in vitro (Davies et Ad, 2004).

LAST CALL
The patient was admitted at Navajo Health Clinic for his injuries. The medical provider is a physician who has years of experience in treating
post-trauma issues and trauma patients. In this case, the medical professional has provided the Navajo with
care that includes the treatment of his post-injury condition. Based on what we know about
this case and what it appears to be related to, we think this is an appropriate case to share with others as
it is one where a medical practitioner has cared for the patient for quite some time. This case does not fall within
the parameters of an acute medical emergency and this would be a case where the doctor might be able to
continue treatment.
Please read the file attached. It is clear that the decision to continue treatment was made by the treating health professional
and not the nurse practitioner. If a nurse's job is to follow up and ensure that a plan of care is created for
patients then why can't the same be done for other health practitioners? Why can you not take a day off from your
job to go into the emergency room and get treated by a doctor if you have a severe injury? When a health profession
like doctors and nurses have the knowledge, resources, and expertise to diagnose and treat serious conditions
such as traumatic brain injury and PTSD, why are they not able or are not willing to step up when there is
serious injury to someone? The nurse must be responsible for providing the resources and information to these
professionals to help them treat their patients and not merely make a diagnosis based on the symptoms of a
person's condition alone. Having said all of this, let me just say that I do not think the healthcare professionals
in our country should be forced to put their lives on hold until they have something like this happen to them. I
believe this young man was very lucky to have been taken care of by an individual so knowledgeable and experienced
with the ways of medicine and nursing. Many people will have more difficult times and still be given care and
help. For me, this particular young lady's life will never be the way it used to belong because of the actions of
someone who did not care enough to seek help for her condition before it got worse. Please read this report
from the Arizona State Department of Health regarding this incident. She goes into detail about what went
wrong with this woman and why the state is taking steps to ensure such cases do occur again. Her name and phone
number is listed in the document. You may also contact your local state agency to obtain the information she
provides.

"Sexual Selection and Male Sacrifice: From Darwin until Now In order to elicit copulation from females, males will often"," sacrifice one of their own in order for other members of the population to mate. Males are selected by these females as a result of this process which acts as an evolutionary force for the maintenance of large populations. This paper will explore the male sacrifice issue further, with the aim of identifying possible explanations for why the phenomenon exists. The hypothesis that female selection is the primary factor causing male sacrifices is first evaluated. We then consider two possible alternative hypotheses regarding female choice and male genetic inheritance. Finally, we evaluate the effect of selection on mating behaviour (e.g. courtship displays) and sperm production. Based on the results of these tests, it is proposed that male choices may be based on two different strategies. One strategy includes a preference for females who can produce more viable offspring, thus maximising the number of future generations. In other situations, the preference is expressed towards those females with more genetic variance, hence allowing the males to fertilise more eggs. Although the mechanism by which the two strategies are formed is not clear, reproductive success in terms of viability and fitness is likely to be affected. These differences may favour some males or females over others, depending on whether or not the trait being studied is sexual in nature.



Introduction In nature, when a female is faced with a choice between two males, she will typically prefer to choose the one with greater reproductive potential, such as the ones with higher genetic diversity. Evolutionary theories of why females choose males with high genetic potential suggest that this is driven by the desire to produce viable progeny [1], [2]. The advantage to females is that they are able to increase their genetic variability and thereby increase the likelihood of having more offspring. Therefore, selection acting on reproductive traits should have a direct impact on fitness. However, although it has been suggested that the majority of females will take the decision to seek male with better genetic fertility [3], there are exceptions, for example where a male has a high reproductive value [4]. Females also seem to show preferences for males which are associated with certain personality traits. For example, females may prefer aggressive or dominant males because they tend to have more genes that increase reproductive fitness, therefore increasing the probability of being fertilised [5]. However both these traits are strongly influenced by other factors (for example male personality). Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that females exhibit preferences only if their offspring are viable. Furthermore, these preferences are only manifested after the female has made the correct decision. If the mother selects her mate based solely on her reproductive status, no preference would be displayed. Both of its consequences suggests that any preference arising from female reproductive choice is probably a consequence of a ‘female choice’ process. It has even been proposed [6] that it could be related to female preference mediated by sperm quality. Sperm quality is highly influenced throughout the life-cycle by many factors, including female character, sperm density, and environmental conditions [7]. Therefore sperm competition is one way in which sperm quantity and quality are influenced, but it may also be a process that occurs during the mating process itself. Many of us are aware of several studies in both mouse [8], human [9], and fruit fly [10] models which have established the important role that courtships play in determining male fitness in a specific context. Additionally, studies on human subjects have consistently shown that successful courtside interactions are correlated with long-term relationships and increased levels of relationship satisfaction [11]–[15]. Researchers have also demonstrated that positive aspects of courtsides are predictive of long term marriage success [16] and that social network size is positively associated to lifetime happiness [17]. With such strong links between courtsional behaviour and relationship longevity, researchers have suggested previously that individual differences in male mating behaviours may provide information about individual variation in relationship quality [18]. Indeed, one study showed that mating effort is associated positively with relationship happiness and negatively with poor relationship outcomes [19]. Moreover, in studies demonstrating that males from a larger social group have longer mating durations than those from smaller groups, investigators have proposed a possible explanation for these associations, namely that individuals from larger groups spend more time courting females [20]. Despite these strong findings, however, few studies have considered the possibility that different mating strategies exist within the same population. Previous work has suggested the existence of similar mating tactics in different species. Recent work in mice has demonstrated the presence of different courtsic patterns, specifically the use of display tactics and vocalisations, across different populations [21]. In particular, chimpanzees have been shown to display non-verbal behaviour in response to males [22] while wild bonobos, a closely related species, have presented a similar behaviour when selecting for mate [23]. Given that these two species are so closely genetically related, this suggests a common behavioural repertoire, possibly related at least in part to their common ancestor. Given this"
"Assessing selection hypotheses for the CCR5-∆32 mutation in Europeans Introduction The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent leading"," to acquired immunosuppression, is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The current epidemic has spread to the majority of European nations, with the highest prevalence being in France, Italy, and Spain. In spite of its prevalence and spread throughout Europe, little is known about the frequency and pattern of CXCR3-delta32 mutations in the general population. This paper aims to investigate the association between the prevalence of the delta32 genotype and the level of immunological suppression in an Eastern Mediterranean population where the epidemic began in 1989. Between 1990 and 2004, over 1,000 HIV-1 infected individuals were enrolled in HIV care in Tehran, Iran; they had tested HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assay at the beginning of their care. DNA was extracted from a peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collected at enrollment and from stored cells frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both DNA and RNA were amplified and sequenced to characterize the structural changes associated with delta 32. Our results show that the incidence of delta 2 alleles is low overall, especially in women. Alleles with short (delA, delB, DELA) and long (DELC) deletions were the most frequent. Although the frequencies of these allelic combinations were similar among the two genders, the median level VL was significantly higher in females. Delta 2 appears to be a rarer allele than previously thought, since the observed frequency of this allele within the male cohort was only 17% compared with 60% among females who were heterozygous for delta A/A or delA/delC. Finally, we also show here that CTCF binding sites, previously reported to associate with CCL5/RANTES, are absent in our dataset. Based on these data, it appears that there is a strong association of Delta 32 with lower levels of viral control in Iranians. We conclude that, although it is rare, Delta A32 may be important in limiting the replication of HIV infection in humans."
"The Forgotten Tropical Ecosystem Aided by the mass media, environmental groups and their celebrity"," supporters

In 1996 the U.S. Senate approved the National Environmental Policy Act, which set about to reverse the gains of the previous decade in protecting the environment. The law did this by creating a National Commission on Climate Change to study the problem and recommend policy fixes, such as carbon pricing and pollution controls. In its report released in 1998, the commission concluded that carbon dioxide emissions were the major cause of global warming and that only voluntary measures could solve the issue.


A decade later, with the same conclusion, a newly formed UPRI (the Union of Petroleum Exporting Countries) joined forces with Exxon Mobil to seek a “solution” from Congress. Under pressure from the oil industry, who had lost hundreds of millions of dollars over its oil spill in Ecuador, Congress finally agreed to put in place the cap and trade system that it had previously rejected. This system, created in response to lobbying by polluting industries, would be based on market forces and would exempt countries from trading in fossil fuels.

Introduction
Throughout this book, I have tried to convey to you the truth of life in the tropical forests. I do this because I want you to understand that the life-saving ecosystem that we share with tropical species is one of nature’s greatest gifts to humankind. We need these forests to survive, but they are also essential for the survival of our children and grandchildren. If we don‘t conserve and restore the biodiversity and ecological health of these habitats, we risk being left behind by a century of progress and will face a much more bleak future than we currently face. Our greatest vulnerability is the loss of tropical biodiversity. That is why we need to preserve these ecosystems. Therefore, when we talk about what needs to be done to protect the ecosystem, my objective is clear: to increase the amount of time we spend in tropical environments. As climate change takes a greater role in determining our future, increased time spent in these natural ecosystems will be crucial.2
The fact that conservationists have been advocating for a long time for more time in nature is largely due to their success in convincing people that time is money. Time is a precious resource that is best invested in saving nature.3 So while politicians often talk of conserving and restoring the natural world, they usually forget that money can go a lot further than simply conservations and restorations.4 The real cost of conservation is not the cost paid by people to manage the land or the sea; it is society itself. Through conservation campaigns, societies can become more aware of their own responsibilities to nature and to each other, and develop better habits of thinking and living in harmony with nature, instead of being caught up in a struggle for survival.5
Without a doubt, conservation has had the most profound impact on human history. Throughout human existence, nature was constantly under threat and must have repeatedly saved and renewed itself, if it was to continue to exist. Just as people today use conservation as a tool to help conserve wildlife, scientists and other experts throughout human civilization have used conservation science to save and regenerate nature since prehistoric times.6
Like all conservation activities, taking time to watch and learn from nature requires effort. It takes time. Everyone who cares deeply about the state of biodiversity knows that, unfortunately, no one has the time required to do the work necessary to accomplish a large-scale conservation project.7 But that isn‟t true of every conservation initiative, nor is it true for every project aimed at conservating biodiversity in one location. There are good reasons why conservation projects are often undertaken in smaller, local or national scale. Small-world conservation works require a relatively small amount time and effort to achieve. And many conservation solutions can be pursued in just one year, rather than a lifetime.8 Because of this, small-bore projects tend to yield better results. Many conservation leaders and scientists maintain that small projects can make a huge difference in preserving biodiversity, especially in developing countries.9
But even in developed countries, there are still countless conservation challenges that require much less time than the 30-45 minutes that most of us think of as the minimum needed to educate ourselves about and appreciate the rich diversity of plant and animal life.10 In fact, it may take a quarter of a day just to start learning the names and habits and biology of some of those creatures.11
For example, although we know the majority of people have a high tolerance for insects, ants, birds and mammals, few people care about these insects and birds as closely as they care for other animals.12 Even the best conservation education takes years to build up and can take decades to fully realize.13
Even so, for someone who wants to conserve biodiversity for his/her whole life, 15 minutes of training can add up to a tremendous amount. Not only does a half hour or a full"
"GENETIC ANALYSIS OF Drosophila melanogaster MUTANTS: TO DETERMINE INHERITANCE AND LINKAGE PATTERNS ABSTRACT: Ore-R wild-type (+type) Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly,"," is one of the most widely used models for understanding the inheritance and linkage patterns of Mendel's laws. The collection of more than 100,000 lines of genetically engineered lines has greatly facilitated the study of these questions. In spite of its wide use, little is known about the genetic basis of inheritance in this model system. Our objectives are to characterize the hereditary patterns observed in the wild type and to investigate the potential of several classes of transgenes to produce novel patterns. We further aim to discover the fundamental requirements for successful genetic transmission and linkages of DNA. Specific aims are as follows: 1) To characterize genetic inheritance patterns by analyzing all possible genetic combinations of a set of nine chromosome segmental duplications (chromosomes 2-9) in wild types. 2) We will use genetic complementation to test the hypothesis that segmentation of chromosome 9 alone is sufficient to generate a pattern of progeny phenotypes with only two copies each of segments 2 and 7. 3) If the segmented pattern is established by recombination events, we will determine the frequency of homologous recombinant chromosomes. 4) A set or genes will be identified that influence inheritance. 5) Linkage analysis will map the minimum gene(s) responsible for the observed inheritance pattern. 6) This analysis of genetic composition will provide insight into the mechanism of transcriptional control in D. melanogs."
Lab 3: Plant Competition Introduction The ability of a species to compete for limited," food resources, such as light, water, space and mates, is one of the most fundamental factors that influence the evolution of life on Earth. Recent work by Dr. Julie Wurthmann from Wageningen University and a team of plant researchers has developed methods that allow scientists to predict the frequency of these processes in response to varying levels of environmental stress. The research, published in this month’s issue of Science Advances, focuses on understanding how and why plants respond to particular levels (or ‘challenges”) imposed by the environment. Previous work in the lab showed that plants can adapt to changes in light intensity or water stress at certain times of day and under certain conditions; but these events occurred throughout the year and could be used to characterize the annual cycle of photoperiodic responses. In addition, the researchers showed earlier that there was a strong correlation between the duration of maximum photosynthesis and the amount of water available to the plants. This finding indicates that more water could lead to higher levels in photosynthetic pigments, which in turn would increase their ability to absorb light and use carbon dioxide produced to support growth.

Plant competition is a common feature of terrestrial ecosystems. Studies of past evolutionary history have suggested that plant competition may have influenced the origin of humans. For example, many studies have indicated that the earliest modern hominids had a preference for consuming plants that grew on the ground rather than trees, suggesting that early humans may indeed have been herbivores. Other research has suggested human hunting of large trees may be responsible for the demise of some ancient woodland vegetation, and that tree planting may represent an adaptation of homo sapiens to survive the dry climate of Europe. Work in Africa has shown that trees planted along with gardens led to increased population levels and higher economic output. Finally, studies in China have shown the importance of forest cover for human welfare. Although the factors leading to competition in different parts of today‟s world remain unknown, it is clear that our ability - and our willingness - to live near the forest will be greatly improved by better understanding of how plants compete. Dr Julie Wilkins explains: “Our findings suggest that natural selection is strongly influenced by seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions and suggests that, although the variation in success rates is typically small, selecting for high-quality photosynthsis is critical to survival.“
It is estimated that 70 percent of all terrestrial species are currently under threat from human-induced threats such woody debris removal, pollution and habitat fragmentation. Therefore, understanding the impact that species have on their environments is key to understanding their responses to these pressures. Our understanding about the effects of competition comes from the study of single species, though multi-species systems have also been examined. A classic multi taxonomic system is that of birds and mammals. Many of us know that birds are not able to successfully compete in our gardens due to their rapid growth rate and competitive habits. However, there have so far been no studies on competition within mammals, until now. Researchers in Australia have studied a range of mammals and found that many are able grow under adverse environmental circumstances, even when initially under stress from predators. Additionally, these studies show that mammalian species may benefit from competition when growing in fragmented habitats. As Dr Wilkin states: ""We hope this research will stimulate interest in studying other potential sources of inter-specific competition.""
Studies of multi species systems indicate that competition can occur among different species. Early on in development, embryos experience a ‚‚competitive struggle‛ during the first two weeks of development. During this period, each individual embryo undergoes a process of „intra-uterine cannibalism‖, in which one parent cannibalizes its own offspring. Subsequently, this process is repeated until all eggs are consumed, with the last egg surviving and being fertilized by another parent. Under these conditions, parents can often use an external environment to assess their offspring‒to ensure that they have a fighting chance if they choose to mate. If the mother is unable to produce a clutch of viable offspring, she will ’‌not‎—have any offspring and will become a sexual cannibal. Ultimately, a mother′s ability, or ‹  fitness›‹, to prevent cannibalization of her offspring determines her reproductive success. Understanding how animals exploit intra-competence is vital to understand how they compete, because differences in fitness can ultimately lead either to positive or negative evolutionary outcomes. Considering the recent findings in multi taxpayer systems, we hope that future studies will focus on predicting the outcome of intra genus competition, especially in regards to patterns of extinction and diversification. We anticipate that identifying the specific factors driving intra generic competition will yield important insights into how species coevolve over long periods of time.

The Effects of Motor Oil on Aquatic Insect Predation Abstract: Modern technology and urbanization have brought about some important," changes in the environment of many aquatic insects. In particular, motor vehicles are becoming more common in urban environments. This paper discusses the potential effects of motor oil on aquatic insect predation. The main focus is on the effect of long-lasting motor oils on predatory fish. Our hypothesis is that motor vehicle use by humans may have a greater effect on fish than any other environmental factor, such as weather, pollution, or water quality. We then applied a behavioral laboratory assay for evaluating predacious fish to test the effects predicted by this hypothesis. Results indicate that even after only 3 months of exposure, fish exposed to motor fuel showed increased levels of feeding than did fish with no exposure to any type of fuel.

Introduction
============
  Insects are the most diverse and abundant animals on Earth. More than 100,000 species are known to be capable of being preyed upon by fishes ([@ref-9]). These animals have an extraordinarily wide range of body shapes, sizes, and ecological niches. Many of these insects possess complex and effective behavioral strategies to detect the threat of predators and to overcome their predations ([Table 1](#table-1){refит}; [@ ref-43], [www.insectpredators.org/](www://www%20in%2008ster%2006/); [Box 1.](#bx){""}) In order for these organisms to successfully avoid predators, they must develop specialized sensory systems to understand and respond to their environment. Although the sensory capabilities of insects have been extensively studied over many years ([box 2](http://iis.ece.ubc.ca/fss/data/index.php?page=data&id=0), [Table 2)](http:\//iitn/resources/pdf/Nyropus%204%2C%202%281%29.pdf), the specific adaptations needed to survive the predaceous attacks of aquatic animals remain unknown. Fortunately, scientists have recently begun to uncover the behavioral responses of some species to predators. One of the earliest studies to document these behavioral adaptations was conducted by *E. fuscipes* ([Fig. 1A](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617702287)). This species is one of only two described species of *Exocephalus* that feeds exclusively on benthos (soil particles) in shallow ponds. Studies of their ability to perceive, detect, locate, track, mimic, attack, capture, kill, deter, escape, chase, frighten, alarm, confuse, trick, entice, mislead, manipulate, trade, bargain, deceive, surprise, persuade, confound, rouse, incite, inspire, motivate, reassure, attract, solicit, stimulate, amuse, enchant, tempt, make food, perform sex acts, engage in sex roles, learn, remember, name, categorize, process, store, recall, repeat, employ, memorize and use tools during foraging have all been documented ([Figs. 1B]([1D--1F](\u2014050634395882_1_En){#supp1} and [2](^\|\ \|^ [Figure S1](/images/87955/S1.figures/F1d.jpg))) ([Tables 3](DOCX file: Table ZIP)) ([Box 2.2.1)](\#box2)\]. Despite these impressive features, little is known about the general behavior of this species. Therefore, we took an integrative approach to study the behavior patterns of an individual species and the ways in which those behaviors relate to each other and affect the predator's behavior. Based on our findings, our hypotheses regarding the influence of oil exposure on *exoemphenids* can be tested. Consequently, the application of a laboratory model of predated fish would allow us to assess the effectiveness of various chemicals and identify the factors that influence predatorial behavior under laboratory conditions. Finally, because there is evidence that many types of insecticide resistance are being developed by fish ([File S4]()/[S6](/#supplementary-material-only)), we also explore the applicability of our model to this phenomenon.

Comparison of Hypothesis Testing in a High vs. Low-impact Journal Introduction The development of a testable hypothesis is an important," and frequently requested activity in the scientific community. The field of statistics is replete with various hypotheses. Statistical testing methods and statistical tests are widely used, for example, in all aspects of medicine, from diagnosis to treatment planning. In many instances it is critical that the test statistic be generated by a valid hypothesis, especially in research and medical applications. However, often the quality of the experimental data makes this difficult. This is especially true in medical/clinical research, where the experiments are performed under different conditions and there may be a high risk of confounding factors. Therefore, it can be helpful to test the null hypothesis using appropriate statistical methods. Under this situation, the researcher would like to check if the observed effect size is sufficiently small, so that further studies are unlikely to be able to detect the effect even if it exists. A wide range of methods has been developed to assess the significance level of an individual parameter (e.g., p-value) in both parametric and nonparametric situations. Although the most popular techniques belong to the class of hypothesis testing, they should be distinguished from other types of statistical testing. For example: CIs, t-tests, z-test, etc. are commonly used as hypothesis tests. Other types such as the Fisher or Wald-type test, or a log transformation of some measure will not be used. Finally, when a linear regression model is applied, these tests will be called parameter-corrected or model-adjusted tests (i.e., according to [23]). When a GLM is used to model a dependent variable X, those tests must also be adjusted for the covariates, such that for each independent variable Z, one set of coefficients is estimated. It should also  ery very important to note that, since the target hypothesis , i. e.  : the true mean value of Y, cannot be assessed without knowing the values of its parameters. Consequently, we require a full characterization of their respective distributions, which is generally carried out by analyzing the likelihood ratios or their equivalent. Many methods are available to compute the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of these parameters, and these are the ones typically considered for hypothesis fitting. Not all of them yield identical results. Nevertheless, on several occasions, methods based on these MLEs have been shown to produce consistent results [6]. These include methods that fit the data using a restricted maximum entropy (REME) estimation method, although these do not necessarily provide the same results as those based upon maximum posterior probability (MPP). If the MSEs of both methods were the only criterion used for comparing their results, then it could be concluded that REME was superior. Both approaches have the additional benefit of being capable of handling cases in which there are multiple categories or levels of exposure in observations. There are several other methods of specifying the distribution of parameters that can also lead to consistent estimation of parameter values, but these more sophisticated methods require more elaborate programming and are beyond the scope of this chapter. Given these complexities, instead of attempting to specify the parameters exactly, researchers typically rely on the use of approximate methods, namely those that assume some form of smoothness assumption, sometimes referred to as a likelihood or smoothing prior. Such methods tend to outperform the exact methods because they are able take into account any effects of over- or under-parameterization. More specifically, given a set  of observed values  x1, x2,...,xn, let  be the joint density function of  and let δ be some fixed tuning parameter. Based on this, a generic approximation of η is defined as follows: Letting  denote the quantile of distribution at. Then the following expression is proposed as an approximation to  in terms of
where  is the integral operator,  represents the mean function, λ is some tuning constant,and  represent the remaining parameters of interest. Notice that here we are approximating  with the empirical distribution. As discussed earlier, this is simply an assumption about the variance of y, whose value is specified by the observation design. One of us (A.B.) made the suggestion that it might be preferable to replace  by its corresponding MISE, something that has actually been done in several situations (see, e g., [10]). A quick look at the mathematical literature suggests that Mises' estimator (the estimand of choice in this context) is probably the best choice for approximations of moments of distributions. Note, however, that this Mise-estimated moment is not the limit of asymptotics; rather, as n tends to infinity, ∞∫0∞f(X)dX→0. Fortunately, with this simplification, Eq. (1) becomes a relatively simple approximation. Unfortunately"
Drosophila Lab Report Introduction Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal genetic model organism in," which to study the molecular organization and function of intracellular organelles. In addition, studies of the physiology of these organelle compartments are difficult in this organism due to the small size and ease of manipulation of its cell types. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the cellular processes involved in organellar biogenesis and to discover the specific roles of particular subunit composition or protein post-translational modification that underlie these processes. D. melanogsae cells are the only non-drosopnean model system in terms of having defined sets of cytoplasmic organeller components. This project utilizes the two-cell stage of Dm as a primary model to investigate the organization of organella in wild-type and mutant cells and also to analyze the influence of transgenes on organelling. Studies of nuclear import, nuclear export and cytochrome bb/f complex assembly in both control and transgenic cells will be used to test the hypothesis that the interactions between the cyc b/ f complex and its cofactor, Lsb, serve a key role in the maintenance of an organized nuclear compartment. Cell cycle-related changes in nuclear morphology and transcriptional activity will also be investigated as they have not been widely studied in Dp. These studies will provide new insights into the signaling pathways utilized during the cell cycle and may provide novel therapeutic strategies for increasing organelin stability and fidelity in humans. [unreadable] [uig ukdw dkj] Relevance: Determining the mechanisms by which organellen assemble and grow is important for understanding the fundamental cellular functions of each type of macromolecule. Disorders affecting the quality or quantity of any part of a cell could lead to many different pathologies, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Therefore, understanding how the organells interact with each other and with the cytoskeleton is critical to understanding normal development and aging. Finally, because organels are often the target of toxic agents, drug design efforts should attempt to modulate organelled structures in order to prevent the effects of toxicity. Thus, this project will use Dn as an experimental system to begin to uncover the biological processes that govern organel organization in mammalian cells. Ultimately, results from this work may be directly applicable to human diseases associated with organar defects."
"Conjugation Lab Report Introduction Bacteria are unicellular, haploid organisms that are suited for"," self-renewal and the long-term survival. This obligate bacterial life strategy requires several different biological processes, such as cell division and inheritance. In order for these processes to be able to take place, bacteria must be capable of conjugating their genetic material with the chromosome of another bacterial cell. Conjugative transfer is the most important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes, especially for genes that encode proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolism. The conjugal transfer of DNA allows the exchange of genetic information between bacteria without a direct physical contact, and this is one of the central biological principles of life. Recent studies have provided new insight into the mechanism of transfer by analyzing both genetic diversity and structure of bacterial conjunctival biofilms, which can be used as a model system to study the structural and functional aspects of HGT in bacteria[@b1][@ 1]. The use of genetically engineered conjuctival isolates as biofilm models may provide new opportunities for exploring the fundamental questions regarding the biological significance of inter-bacterial conjuity and its effect on bacterial behaviour.

Bacteria live in symbiosis with eukaryotic hosts. Eukarya, mostly fungi, serve as the source of food and shelter for bacteria. Many of these bacteria are associated with fungal colonies, called mycelium, on decaying wood or other plant material. Although the majority of mycoflora do not exhibit any apparent morphological signs of symbioses[^1^](#fn1){ref-type=""fn""}, some bacterial symbionts are able survive within mycolic acids of plant cells and even on the surface of insect or animal tissue[--](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium). These bacteria can then be maintained as endospores inside plant bodies. Bacterial endophytes are nonpathogenic, although they can represent an important pathogenicity factor when they persist longer than a few days inside the host[**9**](http://journals.iucr.nl/cgi/data/journal_12117130/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.87.016205), i.e. they maintain a long presence in the plant's tissue. Endophytic bacterial strains isolated from different parts of plants, including those found in human tissues, can also harbour antibiotic resistance genes[8](/#f8){#sch1}[9](![](AAP-17-928-g001.jpg ""inline image"")) and can act as opportunistic pathogens when infecting animals or humans. Finally, mycorrhizae are plant roots or hyphae that form a physical connection between plants and microbial partners[10](!![!~](asoc-5-2016-045-e009.gif ""image"")](/ascchem093601-ASCO:42016453\#fig9){

"Investigation 6: Plasmid Transfer, Genetic Stability and Nisin Resistance in Lactococci Abstract Lactococci are important because they have several applications to"," the food industry and as a nutritional source for animals. In this report, the lactococcal cells are grown in a fed-batch fermentor under shake flocculation and in anaerobic conditions. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min and then suspended in 0.2M NaClO. Subsequently, lacticin B was added at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml and the cells incubated for 96 h at 30°C with shaking. Cell growth curves were analyzed and viability was determined after subculturing onto MRS agar plates. DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to analyze plasmids and RNA transcripts. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from cell pellets were confirmed by plating on M17 agars. Nisopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) resistant cells with stable genetic stability were investigated in both aerobic and anoxic microenvironments. Growth in glucose medium and production of laminarin, nisin and peptides were monitored. Finally, expression of the niaD and paaA genes was assessed.

Introduction The importance of Lb. brevis, a member of Gram-positive listeria bacteria, for industrial development is obvious, not only for its ability to produce various valuable enzymes like amylases, proteases and aminoglycosides, but also for the natural resistance to many biocidal compounds including antibiotics. Antimicrobial substances produced by L. boulardii are mainly related to exocellular biosynthesis. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the antimicrobial substance in recombinant form. Although the production strain is not required for this process, other strains of microorganisms could be used. Due to their ability of antibiotic production, such strains are considered promising candidates for biotechnology. 2. Overview of Methods In order to study the potential of genetically engineered LBC strains for obtaining new antimicrobials or other biologically active compounds, methods for transformation of target organisms have to be developed. Direct gene replacement is the most frequently used method. However, this approach results in loss of function, especially for genes coding for metabolic enzymes. Insertion of a gene into a chromosome is a more common method, which does not lead to loss-of-function mutations. Both approaches have been extensively used for several years. Many different plasmodial strains have so far been transformed using this method and a large number of publications have described successful results. 3. Microscopic Studies Microscope studies of transgenic LACs have shown that single cells and small clusters can be observed after transformation. 4. Protein Analysis To evaluate the quality of expressed proteins, western blotting experiments are commonly used either directly after induction or after prolonged incubation of cells in culture medium. Proteins expressed in cultures containing recombined vectors are usually detected by chemoluminescence techniques. 5. Transient Gene Expression For functional analysis of introduced genes, promoters have mostly been used, although it has been reported that expression levels may be lower than initially expected. Promoters allow constitutive expression, whereas inducible promoters provide control over expression level. Several promoters are known to induce strong expression in all kinds of media and environmental conditions tested. 6. PCR Assays Primer-Extension Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCRP) is one of these widely used methods. It is suitable for detection of nucleic acids of unknown sequence, cloning and amplification of large genomic fragments, mapping of chromosomal loci and screening for mutations and mutations associated with certain genetic diseases. 7. Expression Analysis Expression analysis enables detection and quantification of mRNA and protein levels of specific genes. Detection of particular products by standard procedures requires knowledge about the specific transcript structure. 8. Electron Microscanning Confocal Laser Scanning Micrographs (EMSC), as well as Transmission Electromagnetic Tomography (TEM), are applied to visualise the cellular morphology. 9. Chromatin Immunoprec"
Genetic analysis of a mutant strain of Drosophila melanogaster Abstract Drosophila melanogaster was the organism used in this genetic," study. The mutant phenotype, called d2, is characterized by a failure to produce sperm, which leads to male infertility. In order to obtain the mutant with the same phenotype as the wild type strain d7, we first isolated the homozygous mutation using standard techniques. Subsequently, the mutation was introduced into the d5 strain background by microinjection. This yielded a strain with approximately 50% reduction in male fertility. Next, Southern hybridization studies identified the loss-of-heterozygosity at a specific band on chromosome 2. PCR amplification of DNA from a genomic library of the parental strain revealed a deletion of 6.2 kb. Sequencing of this region revealed that it contained the locus for the sperm-dysfunctional phenotype. Finally, expression of an RNAi targeting this locustic sequence partially rescued the male sterility. Our results suggest that the defective sperm production in the heterozygote and homozygotes involves a gene(s) located on the chromosome arm 2R. Introduction of homologous sequence to this gene allowed for recovery of spermatogenesis. Thus, this approach could be used to generate a stable homoplasmic mutant of any gene of interest."
"Analysis of a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster Abstract: Drosophila Melanogaster, known as the common fruit fly, is"," one of the most widely studied model system in evolutionary genetics. In particular, the genetic basis of color variation in its two most diverse subspecies, melanogasta and nigro-stigmata, has been extensively studied over the last three decades. The melanism of these two species is characterized by two different patterns of pigment production in the dorsal wing. Pigment production occurs in all regions of life including larvae, pupae and adult flies, with the exception being the wing hairs which are only present in mature adult males. Although the pigmentation of some regions such as wing scales is controlled by a single gene, others are controlled via multiple genes. Our understanding of this complex pattern of pigments and melanins has increased considerably over time. This review will summarize our current knowledge on the pigment genetics of melanogenesis and its regulation in D. melanogsga and Dp(2)Y,a mutation of which was discovered in 1989. We shall also discuss the genetics underlying a second mutant that affects the expression of several genes involved in melanin production. Finally, we shall provide a historical perspective on what is known about the regulation of hair pigmented regions and the origin of their genetic control.

Introduction Introduction: Melanism in insects Dendroctonus ponderosae A.G. Smith (1921) [1] is the only insect species for which both male and female melanization have been quantified to date. It is thus one among the best-studied model systems in comparative evolutionary biology. Other insect models for studying the evolution of body surface patterns include those of Lepidopterans and Coleoptera. [2, 3] A number of different types of mechanisms may underlie the observed differences in development of male versus female phenotypes. These include: differential rates of chromatophore production, [4] the existence of more than one locus responsible for the sex determination [5–6] or a differential rate of proliferation during early developmental stages. However, each of them can be tested using experimental methods such like crosses [7] and transgenic approaches [8]. Genetic models of choice are the two melanocidal genes in M. viridescens, designated as Mu and Mn, respectively. Mu acts as a direct target of an enhancer element within the UASA region [9] while Mn is indirectly induced by its interaction with UGTs [10]. While it is clear that these mechanisms contribute to the modulation of black versus yellow coloration, there is little empirical support for either of those two models. Experimental studies of Mu could not detect any effect on melanosis in any tissues at any stage of development [11] although it has long been known that Mu inhibits the biosynthesis of carotenoids, especially lutein [12]. The first comprehensive study of Mv Mn was published by Aoki et al., [13] in 1997 where they described a phenotype characterized as having a dark black stripe on both wings and a distinct pale stripe in females. While the phenotype is easily recognizable as that of males, females have a darker, cream-colored abdomen [14]. Later studies focused on Mw Mn [15] which resulted in a similar phenotype, although with a slightly lighter abdomen. More recently, Kudo etal. showed that Mwn is expressed in both genders, and that it regulates the developmentally important segmentation gene rr3 in male wings. They also demonstrated that the male phenotype results from a dominant mutation, since females carrying the wildtype allele had the expected phenotype [16]. However neither of previous models account for how Mm, which is induced in males by the Mu enhancers, gives rise to a specific phenotype in female flies. Thus, it remains unknown if Mwt, produced by Mwm, or Mnm, induced independently by Mu, give rise exclusively to males or females, thereby affecting the same phenotype. Therefore, this model should allow us to understand how melaninescent regions arise and why they are regulated. To address these questions, additional melanogenic genes have to be identified and their respective mutations characterized. Here we present a comprehensive literature survey concerning the physiology of four genes that belong to this class of genes: Mmn, Mmus, Muz and Mt. For each gene we have summarized the existing data available on its expression pattern, function, mechanism of action, association with melanoblasts and histochemical characterization. Additionally, when available, data concerning its chromosomal location, RNAi and RNA analysis are provided. Phylogenies built upon these data are then used to hypothesize evolutionary relationships among these melanogens. Evolution of Melanic Genes: Evolutionary relationship of Mutagenic-associated"
Conjugation Lab Report: Bacterial Conjugation and Genetic Mapping in E. Coli Abstract In this experiment we studied the phenomenon of conjugation," of a strain of Escherichia coli, HB101, with various strains of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for the purpose of identifying genes involved in conjugal transfer as well as the conditions that influence it. The experiments showed that conjuagation takes place between the two strains, but the frequency of transfer is much greater from Bacilli to Pseuds. This finding could lead to the isolation of these bacteria as a source for heterologous protein production. Experimental results and discussion on the mechanism of DNA exchange between E coli and Bacillium are included. Appendix includes a video clip of the experiment.

Baker from the Natural Science and Engineering Research council ofCanada. Authors' contributions: D.J.G. conceived and designed the project; DAG performed most of all experiments; H-HZ performed data analysis and wrote the manuscript.

1 Introduction The phenomenon known as conjunctival transmission of microorganisms is one of several biological processes that occur frequently in nature. In some cases, such as that involving food products, product contamination can occur through contamination of raw materials or through direct exposure to microbial agents [2, 3]. However, other studies have shown that the same bacteria can be transferred through the respiratory route, especially when the route is the nasal mucus [4–6]. The process of transmissibility of bacteria has long been thought to be due to bacterial adherence to surfaces. Indeed, many pathogens have been shown to attach to abiotic surfaces like glass, polystyrene, glass-ionomer cement, latex, rubber, nylon, cotton, wool and wood [7–9]. It has also been suggested that adhesion of certain microbes to biomaterials might be responsible for chronic infections that cause serious morbidity and mortality [10]. In addition, it has been hypothesized that biofilms may contribute to colonization of implanted medical devices and that implant failure is associated with biofilm formation [11]. Although the majority of reported studies focused on environmental bacteria, experimental evidence exists that disease-causing microbes are commonly transferred within living hosts. Studies of humans infected with certain strains demonstrate that infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is transferred during the digestive tract, specifically the oropharyngeal region [12]. Other human pathogenic bacteria such N. meningitidis and P. aerugenosa are also believed to transfer into the host via the gastrointestinal tract [13–15]. Despite the apparent importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the factors that promote or inhibit the transfer of particular bacteria. Some of us have previously conducted a large-scale experiment using Eubacterium biforme to investigate the effect of inoculum size on transfer efficiency. Our results indicated that transfer efficiencies were high when very small numbers of E. bifolium were added, suggesting that either transfer occurred at a high frequency or there was a threshold number of cells that promoted transfer [16]. We also observed that E b iallelic variant strains were much more efficient in transferring into B. subtlilum than were the wildtype [17]. With the completion of genome sequence projects, additional genes have now been discovered in many prokaryotic genomes that are believed play important roles in mediating conjuguance. Recent studies utilizing a set of bacterial strains representing different phylogenetic backgrounds have identified many genes that serve as potential components of “sensors” for interaction with a variety of environmental cues. These include genes encoding for toxins, adhesins, flagella, chemotaxis and sugar metabolism enzymes [18, 19]. While much work has focused upon the genetic basis of natural competence in enteric bacteria (reviewed in [20]), much less is understood regarding the genetics of uptake of macromolecules by commensal species. More generally, although it is clear that natural conjuction occurs between bacteria of different genera, few studies exist which examine whether the molecules involved can transfer between species of similar phylogeny. One study showed poor expression of transformation genes in heterogeneous Gram-negative species [21]. Another study examined the natural transformation of two closely related species, Salmonella enterica and Erythrobacter sp., and concluded that differences in transformation efficiency were due primarily to difference in the expression levels of genes controlling transformation [22]. Finally, a study carried out using Bacteroides fragilissimus, concluded despite the absence of antibiotic resistance, the organism could be used as an alternative host for recombinant proteins [23]. Therefore, considerable efforts"
Drosophila Melanogaster Genetic Analysis Experiment Abstract In this experiment the Ore-R phenotype (wild type) of," a natural population of Drosphila melanogasta was compared with the same phenotype in the absence of selection pressure. The resulting data show that selection on a single variable (elevated levels of melanin) causes a large change in all traits of the population, but the effect of this selection is greater for traits affected by two or more variables. In contrast, there is little effect on the genetic diversity of these traits. This study identifies several different genetic mechanisms that give rise to this phenomenon, including: 1) the selective pressure favouring a genetically uniform subpopulation of males; 2) selection favourring the evolution of an intermediate phenotype; and 3) mutation events associated with a recessive allele. Although the most significant gene(s) involved in these mechanisms may remain unknown, the results described here provide new insight into the mechanism of evolutionary change that underlies natural variation. KEY WORDS natural selection, population genetics, melanism, sex ratio, hybridization, quantitative trait loci. ABSTRACT In a laboratory experiment, D. melanogs have a reduced melanosis phenotype compared to their heterozygote parent. Additionally, although heterologous males have an apparently normal phenotype, they exhibit much greater melanotic variation than homologues. Our results indicate that not only are the two phenotypes genetically distinct, so are their effects on survival. Therefore, we hypothesize that the reduced phenotype is caused by a selective process favouriting an allele that is recessively dominant over a second allele conferring a high level of tolerance to melanins. Using a comparative approach, four candidate genes were identified that may be responsible for this process. These genes encode a putative serine carboxypeptidase II, a member of cysteine protease family, which may cleave melanosomes; an LRR receptor kinase, required for normal melanogenesis; a tyrosinase-related protein, whose expression increases during melanogenic differentiation; [and] a GTP-binding protein implicated in signal transduction. Finally, it appears that melanoma has arisen by mutation of one of our candidate gene alleles. We suggest that mutations in one gene may produce two copies of another gene causing a phenotype of enhanced melanoid secretion from pigment-producing cells."
Mapping of Genes in a Mutant Strain of Drosophila Melanogaster Abstract Drosophila Melanogaster (the common fruit fly) is convenient as," a model system in genetics because it has a high degree of genetic redundancy. The fruitfly genome contains approximately 50 genes, each encoding a protein that appears to be essential for viability and fertility. In the past few years, however, significant progress has been made toward the mapping of these genes. Many of the genes have been assigned to chromosomes based on their position relative to the sex chromosomes. Although the maps have not been finalized, the loci have now been mapped onto chromosomes 5, 3, 4, 17, 8, 15, and X. This review will describe the progress that has occurred in determining the positions of some of this important gene locus and the recent accomplishments at mapping these locuses to their chromosomal sites. These developments will be contrasted with the achievements in cloning the gene for Dpp, a key gene involved in regulating growth in D. melanogasta. Finally, other genes currently under investigation will also be discussed. 2.1 The Identification of Essential Genomic Elements in Fruitflies: An Overview of Recent Progress A number of projects are underway that require the isolation of certain genomic elements and their subsequent use in the construction of transgenic fruitflies. Some of those efforts fall within the category of ""mapping"" of genes in fruit flies, although many others involve the cloning and characterization of an entire new set of DNA sequences. Initial efforts in mapping genes included the identification of a large number chromosome arms containing genes that are associated with specific cellular processes. One such example is the analysis of chromosome 7, which contains genes coding for proteins involved mainly in signal transduction and oogenesis. Other sets of candidate genes were identified that encode proteins that participate in different biological processes, such as those encoding enzymes responsible for the processing of carbohydrates and lipids. Another set involves genes involved directly in development, including those involved specifically in muscle cell differentiation and in brain patterning. More recently, efforts have focused on the characterization and molecular cloning of several hundred genes from a number or fruit-flies species. Characterization of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries derived from developing embryos, larvae, eggs, sperm, or adult tissues are being performed in an effort to identify genes expressed during the life cycle of various fruitflies. ESTs obtained from mRNA isolated from whole embryos or early developmental stages can subsequently be used to obtain cDNA libraries that can then be screened using standard techniques. Cloned cDNAs can be sequenced and compared with EST sequences available in public databases. Preliminary results indicated that, with only 10 members of known sequence, about 40 percent of EST database sequences do not have a hit in GenBank. Therefore, no attempt to correlate EST presence with a specific gene product has yet been undertaken. However, considerable progress in this regard has begun. [unreadable] [Unreadable][unable to open link] This project utilizes the resources at CGC to perform high-density genetic mapping in three species of fruitfishes (Oreochromis mossambica, Oryzias latipes, Lates niloticus), a newly described fish species that is distributed in Southeast Asia. Our first objective is to characterize the genomic organization and evolution of four chromosomes of O. mossa. We will map these chromosomes with high resolution using conventional physical mapping techniques and develop comparative maps of all three genomes. Linkage analysis will allow us to test the hypothesis that these regions are composed of conserved synteny between the three Oomyzas' genomes, since these comparisons will provide the basis for constructing the first comprehensive physical map of any eukaryotic genome. Additionally, we will produce a physical linkage map to facilitate the positional cloning by BAC clone generation and Bgl II/SpeI fragment library construction. Physical mapping will continue with two newly discovered Oligochaetes species, Toxotes vivax, for which we have assembled the genome sequence and finished the draft genome assembly. Molecular mapping by Southern blotting will establish the order of homologous DNA segments and distinguish between species-specific chromosomally duplicated segments. Sequence comparisons of putative genes will yield clues about the evolutionary relationships of particular chromosides. Ultimately, this will advance our understanding of genome structure and determine how genes may be organized into novel chromosomes. Both of our primary goals will rely on sophisticated and efficient hybridization techniques that allow one to detect very small and specific DNA regions. Given the extraordinary efficiency of double-color detection, hybridizations can generate up to 100 million pairs of detectable DNA probes. Specific probes will initially be labeled with digoxigenin or fluorescein amidite (FAM or FAM) and then subjected to hybridizing experiments. Subsequently, these probes undergo extensive sequencing to determine the complete sequence of each DNA strand. Thus, once a cluster of uniquely labeled probes has formed"
"The Effect of Initial Carbon Dioxide Concentration on the Rate of Photosynthesis in the Aquatic Plant Elodea Introduction: In the field of plant biology, one of the"," most important questions of a plant is the influence of environmental variables, such as light, on growth and photosynthesis. Light is one the main factors that influence photosynthetic metabolism, therefore the experimental design for determining the effect of an environmental stimulus on photosystem reactions can be complex and difficult. Theoretically, light may be a stimulus for the reaction of some photosensors, but it has no effect on all photosome components. This theoretical limitation has limited the development of new photosytem research methods and our understanding of photosynaptic functions. In order to overcome this limitation, we need to understand the mechanism of photoprotection at the molecular level, with the aim of discovering more effective plants that can withstand the effects of light stress. For this purpose, the present paper will introduce a novel experimental system, in which the variation of carbon dioxide concentration in air, can change the amount of water loss during the assimilation of CO2 by aquatic plants. Our study shows that the chlorophyll fluorescence signal is affected by the initial concentration of atmospheric CO₂. By using this new approach, it will be possible to study the role of changes in photosensitivity during growth in different species.

1 Introduction 1.1 Purpose and Concept of this Paper The aim was to investigate the response of chloroplasts from different marine algae to changes of their initial CO 2 concentration. 2 Experimental System The first aim consisted of determining how the CO² concentration affects the rate of oxygen uptake by phytoplanktonic plants in pure water. Therefore, 30-60 mL algal suspensions were incubated in three different CO ~2~ concentrations (0.10, 0.15, and 0% CO ₃) in a 3 L photobioreactor for 28 d under continuous irradiance (400 µmol photon m⁻² s⁴⁸⁾m⁺). Phycotocline was observed by means of flow cytometry and fluorescein diacetate staining. Photosystem II (PS II), the H2O-O2-ATPase and cytochrome b5 were quantified by steady state chloroform methenamine-HCl fluorometry. Electron transport chain and PS I were monitored by fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Finally, chloroplast morphology was determined by transmission electron microscopy. 1. Measurements of Total O 2 Content and O ~ 2 Production The second aim aimed to determine the maximum photoswitching efficiency of cytoplasms from each species when incubating in 0%, 0·10%, and 10 % CO С. To avoid the undesirable influence caused by CO gas, control experiments were performed in fully CO02 saturated solutions. After 28d of incubation, total O2 was measured in terms of total organic matter (MO 2 ). OXPHOS was calculated as the sum of O : 2 : 4 = 6.25:4.75:2.35 mol mol⁶; ATP synthesis was computed as ATP/O 2 ; and H+ transfer into organelle membrane was defined as: H + ⇋H⁰ +. The net H 2 O exchange rate and the ATP synthase activity were calculated after a steady-state incubations period of 24 h. Oxygen consumption and CO diffusion were measured continuously in both control and experimental systems. Protein concentration was estimated by micro-well spectrophotometry analysis. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and of H(+) transfer were determined after 15 min of steady states incubates. Although the total amount (g ) of biomass in each sample increased between days 0 and 28 in all cases, there was no difference among the treatments ( p = 0 · 10−4 ). The highest increase of cell size was noticed in day 28 for CO0·20, especially for Chloroflexus sp. (8–10%), and in comparison with control samples, higher values were detected in cultures exposed to 0%. From the results obtained, no differences were found regarding ATP content, HCOΩ value, O XPHOST, or H ATP levels between treatments, although lower values than in control cells were reported for other species within the same group. Under the conditions tested, all species showed higher rates of growth at 0 mmol l⁹ COС, particularly in Chloflepsis sp., in accordance with a high O x PHOST and a low rate HAT PEP. However, when the cells reached a size similar to the size of controls, significant differences (p < 0):s occurred according to CO concentration, since the highest values of these parameters were observed in samples grown in 10% O⃔. As far as H AT P EP was concerned, data"
"Mapping of Unknown Mutations In DrosophilaMelanogaster Introduction Drosophila Melanogaster, commonly known as fruit fly, was the"," most widely used genetic model organism for studying human diseases. In the last decades, melanism---the loss of melanin in all tissues---was seen as a primary cause of skin disorders such as melasma, psoriasis, and freckling. The underlying genetic basis of these disorders is still poorly understood, although it has been hypothesized that melanogenesis is controlled by a cluster of genes controlling melanocyte differentiation and survival. Recent studies in several model organisms have identified many genes whose mutations can alter melanins to produce the phenotypes seen in humans. Therefore, flies could be used to study the function of candidate genes in the same manner as other model systems. However, little is known about how melanogens are regulated during development. We use an innovative approach to test the hypothesis that the key transcriptional regulators controlling the expression of the two melanogenic pigments, LMMelanin and M-gene (melanosome), are differentially expressed. Our results indicate that, instead of being encoded by two closely related genes, the LMP7/8 and LAP2/6 transcription factors regulate the transcription of only one of their two target genes. This finding suggests that either the additional genes are not required for normal melanoid production or they act redundantly with the already described melanocortin system. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that Lop1 is the functional ortholog of Dl-type genes regulating developmental processes.The objective of this research is to characterize the melanogene signaling system in D. melanogasta. Specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To define the temporal and spatial expression patterns of LPP2 and its homologs (LPP3 and LPB) in wild- type flies. Aim 2: Using fly stocks carrying specific null mutations in each of four genes (P*melan*) and in three additional candidate melanogen regulatory genes will be generated and mapped onto chromosomal backgrounds. DNA microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from whole- eye imaginal discs and from eye lobes will determine which genes control the spatial and temporal expression pattern of each melanoblast line. [unreadable] [done] PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will characterize a novel melanoma-associated gene mutation using the fruitfly model system, Dnigitalis melanogsaster. Through the characterization of a set of mutations affecting the biosynthesis of pigmentary proteins, this project seeks to provide the basis for understanding the disease mechanisms and to discover novel genes potentially involved in melanomagenesis. Ultimately, these results could lead to the development of better tools for clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with melanosis."
Effects of protein deficiency on organ size in Mus musculus Abstract: The amount of protein (standard animal chow and protein-deficient," diets) in the diets is shown as the amount fed by weight. The standard animal diet was given to each animal while the protein deficient diets were given in three portions. In order to assess the effect of a protein deficit on growth, various parameters were measured such as body weight, liver and brain weight and length. This was compared with the animals which had received standard diets. Protein deficiency decreased growth in all organs examined except for the brain. Brain weight was decreased by 50% in animals given a 0.2% protein level, but an increase of only 10% was seen in liver weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Prevalence of Haemosporidians in birds of Northern Michigan Abstract In this study, the prevalence of Haemosporidians in birds"," from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is described. The species most frequently detected by culture and PCR was Haemonchus contortus, followed by Haemo-borealis and H. polygyrus. PCR can detect all 3 species simultaneously, but results were variable. We conclude that PCR is highly specific for these Haeminoporid species. In addition, PCR may provide a rapid means to diagnose Haemiospora infections. Our results highlight the need for better understanding of the epidemiology of these pathogens in wild birds and the potential of PCR to be used as a routine diagnostic tool in wildlife disease surveillance. Public Health Response: This project was supported by a National Research Service Award (HS02-00008-03) from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and a research grant from Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI).

Introduction In recent years, studies of haematophagous protists have suggested that birds are the primary hosts for several parasitic species of birds, such as the ovispora-like parasites (1, 2) Haemenas (3, 4), the malaria parasite Anopheles (5), and in general, Haemeini (6). Haemanas are coccidian parasite that cause anemia and stunted growth in chickens (7, 8) and haemonches (9) in Eurasia. An additional species, Hhaemolivia, infects hares and small mammals, including humans (10) via erythrocytic stages and is transmitted by flies (11). An overview of some species is given in Table 1. Most studies on bird haeminosis have focused on species within the orders Lepidoptera (12–20) or Psocopterida (21), although less is known about Haemydoidea. Other than Psocomorpha, little is published on Haemnophodes, although Hemicicola parasitizes deer in Australia (22). There is only one report of a Haemicola infection in wood ducks (23), while no reports of an infection with any haematean species are available in North America (24). These findings raise the question of whether there is a relationship between the abundance of blood-sucking insects and bird blood transfusion services. This raises important questions about the utility of wildlife samples in monitoring disease risk in migratory birds. Many haemanids (including the HhH hantaviruses) are transmitted primarily by ticks (25, 26), but other insects, especially biting midges (27), are potentially important vectors. Studies of tick-borne zoonotic diseases have revealed a high prevalence and geographic distribution of Anaplasmosis (28) (see also 29). In contrast, vector competence of many ectoparasites has been documented (30–32). For example, Ectopeloretineans parasitize and transmit Neoseiulus (33) to larval forms of Dipterans and Anoplura (34) through their bite. Haemateatae are ectothermic parasitic worms that inhabit fish and birds (35). They are found in both freshwater and saltwater environments (36). Parasitic transmission of Coccidia (37) is probably a result of their ability to survive in water for long periods (38) rather than being transmitted directly through biting mosquitoes. Therefore, in the absence of efficient blood banking, collecting blood from infected birds represents a rare opportunity to study the spatial and temporal distribution and pathogen diversity of ecto- and ectopathogens. However, because blood samples often cannot be collected from natural populations of large avian hosts (39), they are often provided by captive-bred species (40). Thus, surveys of naturally occurring haemeinid parasitism in captive wild populations are necessary to monitor disease emergence. Although the majority of studies have been conducted on European wildlife, few have addressed the parasite diversity in host-associated species in Central and Southern Hemisphere birds [2, 41]. One of us (J.V.S.) first recognized the association between psocid parasites and American bitterns (42) when we started to investigate psoconidiomata in bats in Asia. Psoconid larvae are associated with the black flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) [43], which was already known to carry psocoecid nematodes in Europe (44). We subsequently identified the larvae of several psocreoid nemotodes (45) based on morphology (e.g., morphology of tail and oral sucker) as well as molecular analyses (46–48). Since then, numerous ps"
Trunk forking in Acer saccharum: a phototropic response to forest canopy gaps Abstract We examined trunk forking in Acer saccharumas an adaptation," to tree canopy gap width. In-site surveys and the analysis of a recently constructed chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system revealed that tree trunks were often not forked, but rather had multiple forks. The distribution of forkers over tree trunk sections was correlated with the size of canopy areas. This demonstrates that trunk branching occurs during the phase of growth in which trees have the widest canopy openings, and that it may be a common mechanism for tree adaptation. Our results highlight how quantitative data from multiple species are integrated to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of processes driving tree phenology.

Introduction In the past decade, there has been a revival of interest in tree species for which there is little information about their morphological adaptations to their environments. Many of these plants have a large number of genetically distant relatives and a high potential of inter-breeding, so the natural history of their populations and their responses to habitat fragmentation are probably influenced by evolutionary and ecological factors. Therefore, studies on such species must take into account both genetic diversity and environmental influences simultaneously. Consequently, it can be difficult to predict the outcomes of different scenarios of future habitat disruption and to test the effect of such events on species distributions and distributions in time. These two aspects need to be understood together in order to assess the risk of extinction for any of the tree genera in the future. Common to many trees is the phenomenon of trunk splitting, especially in larger trees. Although the majority of trees do not exhibit splitting (except when they grow too large), several taxa demonstrate trunk branched structures, such as the most widely distributed species Acacia tridentata and its sister genus Eucalyptus grandis, Acer ginnala, E. huilensis and A. obtusata (e.g., [1]). These trees also have non-brancherous forms like other tree families, e. g., elm, oak, apple and pine. Based on their relative size and shape, these two groups of plants can sometimes be distinguished (Kemp et al., 2008). However, no systematic study has yet investigated whether trunk branches are formed in response or in parallel to the loss of large trees, since most of our knowledge about trunk morphology derives from studies in small and relatively closed-canopy species. Recent experiments showed that in-store conditions strongly affect tree morphology (Bélanger etal., 2009), but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. More generally, the influence of environmental variables on morphology needs to consider not only climatic conditions, water stress, competition, etc., but also the variation in soil nutrients, microclimate, plant vigour, soil type and humidity. Finally, although most studies focused on one or few tree taxonomic families (for instance, Acacias, Lauraceae, Moraceae), a great number remain scattered around the globe, mostly in Central and South America (see, for example, Köhler et Al., 2007; Bébé etAl., 2013; Costa etAly, 2013). Despite these obstacles, trunk-form traits have been frequently studied in these systems and there have also been important contributions from other taxonomical groups such Aspalathus and Taxus (Parry etDavie, 1991; Janssen etChapouleurs, 1994). Even though most research has focused mainly on a few trees (and/or families), the characterization of this process is of fundamental importance for understanding the origin of tree traits. Here we present a detailed study of acorn morphology in six woody plants, each representing one of several potential biogeographic clades, namely the subfamily Phyllomedioideae, Lamiaceae (Aceraceae) family (including Erythranthe spp.), Rhamnaceae and Sterculiaceae. Additionally, we included the tropical deciduous angiosperm Taxillus, because this is one lineage where trunk growth has already been extensively documented ([3]–[5]). Our objectives were to investigate the incidence of branch formation and determine the relationship between forging and canopy size. We also assessed trunk development in three subfamilies of conifers, with a view to addressing the following questions: • How prevalent is trunk formation in wood-decaying taxonages? • What are the forces that cause trunk production? And • Are the two mechanisms mutually exclusive? We used a newly acquired analytical method, chloroform flow cytometry, to analyze changes in chloroplast dynamics in living specimens and in petiole sections under different environmental conditions. Preliminary results suggest that acorns in all of them are forgoing the process of division and for increasing the number and length of branches"
Drosophila Melanogaster lab report Abstract Closer examination of unknown Drosophila Melanogaster strain U3833 results," in a distinct phenotype with the male pupae lacking dorsal appendages or with only one dorsal pair. The newly discovered genetic basis of these phenotypes has been studied to elucidate the genetic mechanisms that allow females to prevent the fusion of wings and dorsal fin. In the absence of a dorsal ventral (DV) pair, females exhibit an intermediate phenotype where the wing is incomplete, with no appendage or only a single dorsal larva. This phenotype is the result of an extra copy of the gene Dscam1 on the X-chromosome. Males with this mutation show the intermediate phenotypic pattern with complete wings, no dorsal fins, and a second copy on chromosome 2. We propose that females have a specialized function that prevents dorsal fusion during the pupal stage. Our results indicate that female ovaries may play an important role in the maintenance of certain genital structures, such as the genitalia. Finally, we suggest that it will be important to investigate whether the novel genetic locus is involved in any other phenocopies for females. More generally, the results described here demonstrate that our understanding of complex sex/phenotype combinations is greatly improved by analyzing a larger number of strains, especially in comparative analyses involving more than one strain.

Results The abdominal segments of females provide the most robust support for the wings. These appendices are located ventrally to the thorax, directly under the segmental disks, so that the two wings expand and fold against each other. Females possess two copies of DSCAM1 which control their wing shape. Both the mutant males and females lack dorsal cups, indicating that both copies are required to produce the appropriate wing patterns. Therefore, in females, D2-DSCAM is essential for either the formation of dorsal wings or the correct positioning of two dorsal pairs. Abdominal segments are formed at different times during female lifecycles. A set of abdominal appendagens, called ‘perches’, is developed in response to changes in food availability during early development. Although the perichordal plates are absent in late larval stages, periocular plates develop by late pupa and early adult stages. Thus, abdominal segment formation requires several different events: 1) the expression of several genes in different tissues, including perikarya, hypodermal cells, muscles, nerves, fat cells and perigynous cells; 2) segmentation of mesoderms, which gives rise to all abdominal organs; and 3) organogenesis within the body cavity. Recent studies in D. melanogaste rai­sans have established the importance of both these processes. For example, RNAi experiments indicated that perimetazoan-specific genes, like peribasal-abdomen homologs (Pabh), were required for segment boundaries. Pabhh had a key role for mesoderm induction, because RNA interference of this gene resulted in embryos with missing perimethiasomes and reduced expression levels of segment specific genes. Other studies identified the presence of perigenital cells in early stages of embryos. Many of them expressed genes similar to those found in peridendritic cells. Interestingly, a set previously identified as a putative sex determination gene was also demonstrated to be necessary for normal abdominal development in zebrafish. Previous work in our laboratory showed that inactivation of Pbabhl led to embryonic lethality in both sexes, suggesting that this process is probably conserved among other animals. It is thus possible that PAbdh acts not only in sex specification but also in embryo development, since it has a crucial role after segment outgrowth. Based on these results, it is likely that DABH acts in several pathways that involve cell proliferation, cell differentiation, tissue patterning and overall animal growth. Surprisingly, when we knocked down Dabhd, using a recently developed technique, namely dsRNAi, there was no change in morphology. Additionally, although we cannot exclude the possibility that dSMC might be able to compensate for Dabbhd deficiency, this is unlikely because we observed very similar effects when using Dsa3, an ortholog of which was previously shown to act in similar fashion. Instead, our results suggest a possible alternative pathway for embryogenesis. Contrary to our findings, several groups reported that knocking down Pabbh in Xenopus embryos caused drastic defects in development of body segments. Studies using dRNA microinjection in frogs and birds confirmed that a similar defect was seen in PBapb/Xenopus, implying that these two proteins act redundantly in this particular developmental process. Noteworthy, overexpression of either DBAgl or PABGAL rescued the defects, strongly indicating an essential role of their protein family members. Collectively, these data indicate a fundamental"
"Small Mammal Response to Post-fire Forest Succession in Northern Lower Michigan Abstract Fire can drastically alter forest ecosystems, and this can"," ultimately cause dramatic and irreversible losses of plant diversity. This paper describes how a large mammal community was impacted by fire, resulting in a shift toward plant successions on both the ground and in the forest canopy that would not have otherwise occurred. The response of wildlife to this disturbance is reviewed, with emphasis on the responses of wolves, coyotes, grey foxes, brown and striped skunks. In addition, other mammals such as the muskrat and otter were found to be negatively affected. Although the loss of a keystone species may not be directly attributable to fire due to many factors, it is clear that the overall loss will be far greater than any previous research has suggested. Keywords Fire, Wildland fire regime, Large mammal response, Wolves, Coyotes, Gray Foxes Wolf, Brown Skunk

1 Introduction The post-flammable era (PFAE) is defined as a time during the past 90 years when fires frequently burned large portions of the North American continent (1). PFAEs resulted in extinctions of some large carnivore communities including North America's iconic deer species and wolves (2). For example, the last wolves in Yellowstone National Park were extirpated in 1872–1873, four years before the Yellowstone Park ecosystem was formally established (3). Extensive efforts to document changes in ecosystems around Yellowstone over the century have documented more dramatic losses in both species (4, 5). These losses have been attributed to human activities, such an increase in livestock and agricultural activities (6). There is evidence to suggest that wolves began to decline in several areas across the Midwest and Northeast in response to the increased development of agriculture (7, 8). Similar changes are known to have occurred within some New England and Mid-Atlantic states over a similar period of time (9, 10). In some regions, especially those outside of large urban areas, wolves have not declined in recent times (11), although they are still considered endangered in all parts of their range (12). One of these states, Vermont, has had wolf populations fall to a fifth of what they once were in 1976 (13). However, because of widespread hunting pressure, many wolves are being reintroduced to their former range through captive breeding programs. Wolves are now thought to exist as two distinct subspecies, each having a slightly different range and diet (14). Both species are considered important prey for bears and cougars (15), as well as for other predators such humans (16). Given these similarities in diet, predators, reproductive physiology, population cycles, life-history traits, dispersal patterns, microclimatic conditions and movement behavior, scientists have concluded that only one of them, possibly the gray wolf, is capable of reaching a stable population size and maintaining a steady, healthy population in its current range. Thus, until now, there has been no evidence for any significant population decline of either species. Furthermore, no ecological studies have ever indicated the potential for these two species to occupy the same landscape as they do today. Other large mammalian communities have likewise become highly diverse over time. Both black bears (17, 18) and grizzly bears have experienced a sharp decline, while moose have undergone a transformation (19) from a once-common presence throughout much of eastern NorthAmerica to becoming rare and imperiled (20). Although mooses are also currently considered threatened, their future habitat may be greatly altered by climate change (21). Species' range shifts are characterized by shifts in physical habitat, genetic structure and biological interaction (22). Much of this research focuses on species that are most vulnerable to changes brought about by human land use, although other animals have also been impacted (23–28). The greatest threat to some animal populations is the ongoing loss or fragmentation of suitable habitat caused by the construction of housing, roads, development and grazing activity (29). This results in reduced connectivity, increased stress and reduced foraging opportunities for animals (30). If these changes occur in isolation, they can have very little effect on populations, but when combined with the continuing destruction of natural habitat and overabundance of humans, these pressures can lead to dramatic population declines. Fire has long been recognized as having the greatest effect upon a range of organisms (31). With the exceptions of moas (32), small mammals are particularly sensitive to effects of fire on their habitats. Studies of both large and small mammalian populations show that fire can dramatically change the characteristics of landscapes (33, 34). Large-bodied species such our great apes, elephants, birds and mammals can adapt to burning landscapes by increasing the size of trees, shrubs, woody debris and foliage, reducing competition for open space, building defensive cover, increasing shelter and increasing their survival rates (35, 36). Smaller-sized species, on average, are more affected by these effects, though some"
Relative Abundance of Myotis septentrionalis and Myotis lucifugus in Three Habitats in Northern Michigan ABSTRACT The local abundance of Myotis septentrionalis (Northern bat) and," M. lucifer Lubbock and Dunlap (Florida) in three habitats in northern Michigan varied from 1 to 2.2 and 0.3 to 3.0 animals per square mile, respectively. In a second study, Mysore bat (M. latrans) abundance was significantly greater than that of Mansonia rossii, with the bat abundance in each study area averaging 3 to 5 bats/square mile. The bat populations in these habitats are being studied to assess their potential for conservation and management. This project focuses on understanding the factors that influence bat predation rates and population abundance.

Myotid species are known to be important foraging elements in many vertebrate prey types. Many myotids have a natural tendency to feed on aquatic animals. Although myobatids are most frequently observed as part of a predator guild, they are also known for their forage behaviors in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Myotinid fishes are reported as a primary forager in several aquatic animal prey groups such as the cyprinid catfish (Siluridae), the zebra fish (Bufo marinus) [1], the stickleback fish Crenicichla striata (Osteoglossomorphae) which is distributed throughout North America [2], and various other fish families [3, 4]. However, myoblasts are considered secondary foragers in a variety of terrestrial vertebrates. Commonly used aquatic species for forages include the pond heron, Anas platyrhynchos, Mallophaga sibilatrix, waterfowl (e.g., Canada goose), water skink, skunk, quetzal, various frogs, and crayfish. Aquatic myobiids commonly obtain prey by means of diving into water or swimming through water [5–10]. The myotinoid-type of neurons is one of the most widely studied sensory pathways in fishes [11] and can be distinguished from those of teleost fishes by their relatively large size and smooth surface. Due to their small size, aquatic myobia tend to inhabit relatively shallow water depths [6]. Although the majority of myofauna has been examined in terms of their ability to detect cues related to prey or danger, few studies have focused on their use of vision systems [12–16].
In terrestrial environments, the presence of predators is critical to maintaining a stable food web. Therefore, predators are necessary for the maintenance of an aquatic ecosystem. Given the increased human activities in aquatic ecosystems, it is important to understand the effects of these changes on fish and bat communities. For example, monitoring the abundance and diversity of foragins (feeding on invertebrates) may provide evidence for habitat changes associated with eutrophication [17]. Studies of water chemistry, such hydrochemical parameters, can provide information on the nutrient content of aquatic systems and determine the efficiency of nutrient uptake by fish [18, 19]. Water column fish communities can also provide useful insights into fish-predator interactions because they maintain stable communities with respect to trophic structure [20, 21]. Thus, studies on water quality and biological responses of fish to predaceous fish may yield valuable information about the composition of prey pools and the potential ecological consequences of overfishing [21]. Furthermore, since myopods are the primary prey consumed by fishes in all aquatic taxa [22], knowledge of relationships between the two could also aid in the conservation of some aquatic fish species. Finally, knowledge about bat ecology may prove useful in conservation planning and environmental remediation. Because many bat species possess a large home range and a high concentration of feeding activity in multiple bat roosts [23], understanding their responses to novel predators may result in improved strategies for reducing bat-associated diseases and improving environmental health. Previous studies of bat foraged fish have established that prey items are utilized within bat colonies, although more detailed knowledge on bat feeding behaviors is lacking. However rodent predators have been found to utilize bat diets [24, 25], thus providing additional evidence that bats may be a key prey source for predators in this ecosystem [25]. Despite these apparent similarities between bats and other predators, little is known about how these two species respond to each other when forgoing their shared prey. Our goal was to investigate the relative abundance, composition, behavior, diet, life-history characteristics, reproductive physiology, habitat use, ectoparasite status, population connectivity, stressors, migratory patterns, resource use and physiological responses in bats using field techniques. We compared these characteristics between bat myotics (n = 16) with bats of similar size but differing in life history and ecological traits. All of our samples"

The Social Impact of Roe v. Wade Although the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade has," had a profound impact on the way women’s bodies and health are regulated, not everyone agrees that the decision was as bad as critics claim. In fact, the majority opinion in Roe was actually a compromise between the two most powerful forces that opposed the ruling: abortion rights advocates and the pro-choice movement itself. The main argument against the controversial decision by the Supreme court was that it could lead to a return to state-run medical care and abortion, something that President Nixon believed would be a “prolonged erosion of the sanctity of life.” As the U.S. Supreme Judicial Court‘s decision in 1973 went into effect, about 1 million abortions were performed across the country, with nearly 3,000 women dying as a direct result. Nearly 200,00 babies were still born with congenital abnormalities or disorders as late as 1982, when the federal funding for these services was cut. This dramatic drop in support for the act led to the creation of a new anti-abortion movement called ‘The Right to Choose."
The E.U.: An Intergovernmental Organization with Supranational Aspirations There is no easy answer to the question of whether," the EU can fulfill its vision of a common market for goods and services. The European Parliament's resolution, on the promotion of intergovernmentalism within the Union, has rightly raised the issue, because inter-institutional cooperation is key to realizing the potential of the European project. This insight is not new. It is the basis of numerous political and judicial decisions that have established the principle of an independent, intergendered Europe. However, in its current form, the resolution fails to convey how intergovernance will contribute to European cohesion, nor does it describe the role that intergovernmental cooperation should play in the ongoing transformation of European social and economic policy. In this article, I provide an overview of what I have termed the intersectoral dimension of transnational governance. Specifically, my aim is to highlight the key aspects of this dimension, such as the interaction between the state and civil society, which may be the most significant factor in determining the quality of policies and institutions. Although the influence of states over civil societies is clear, we still do not understand fully the way in which states shape the ways in

13 JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONS (2015) 18:4 Article No. 11 The main purpose of these essays is twofold: firstly to assess the status of democracy in relation to globalization, and secondly to investigate the nature of democratic participation in globalized societies. Both of them are linked to developments in international relations and to changes in governance systems. Globalization has certainly altered the rules of engagement in world politics, especially in terms of openness to participation at a global level, although it has also increased the amount of attention devoted to problems of security and conflict prevention. Democracy, however, is increasingly called upon to play a more prominent role in these processes. Given this, it is important to pay attention to issues of democratization if we want to understand the transformations taking place in contemporary world history. At the same time, democratizing processes need to be understood in their own right, as they are driven by institutional changes and by shifts in power relations. One of us (M.G.), who is currently studying the history of nineteenth-century European politics at the University of Oxford, works closely with the philosopher Peter Burke. He has recently written a review of his book on ""The Origins of Modern International Relations,"" in International Studies (2014), in order to analyze the specific impact of liberal internationalism in European history during the Enlightenment. To make matters even more complicated, Burke acknowledges that the very idea of liberalism did not originate with Jean Monnet or other leading French thinkers, but rather with James Madison. Thus, while Burke argues that, historically, liberal ideas were confined to a minority of philosophers, his description of their development is highly suggestive of future concerns. Based on Burke's review, let me offer a brief outline of some of those issues. First, one of me' s personal observations suggests that democracies are characterized by a greater degree of equality than is typically recognized. More specifically, when I look at electoral democracies in developed countries, namely those of Europe, North America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all share the characteristics of being pluralistic democracies where there is a high degree o f equality and a relatively strong commitment to open competition. Second, since the beginning of modernity, democracies have been involved in a process of socialization that has had profound effects on their way of thinking, often creating a set of norms that guide behavior. Just as people today know better than ever about what is wrong with various actions, so democracies learn from experience and develop norms about how individuals and groups should behave. Not surprisingly, therefore, they tend to act more carefully and fairly than their more conventional counterparts. Finally, once citizens have learned to behave differently, democratically elected leaders are able to exert a wider range of influence than would be possible through the actions of dictators. A certain amount is shared between government and society in all democratic societies, including those whose rulers have not been democratically chosen. But since democratic governments are elected, a key task is ensuring that their leaders work in accordance with these principles. Under the conditions of globalization, though, these arrangements are challenged. For example, take the recent rise of populist movements in several countries. They have gained popularity largely because they challenge the legitimacy of established governments, suggesting a growing dissatisfaction with democratic traditions. Their rhetoric is replete with promises to end the social compact between ruling elites and the majority of people. As many scholars have noted, populists' discourse seems to stem from a sense of alienation from traditional forms of representation, particularly in western democracies. Popular movements also seem to represent an expansion of popular demands beyond the existing framework of legitimate political expression. Many of today' e trends include a strong emphasis on deregulation of markets, increased inequality, deregulation and privatizations, privatization of public assets, corruption,"
"The Democratic Inadequacies of the European Union Throughout the past sixty years, the European Union has progressed"," in its policies towards the developing world. This can be understood from a macroeconomic perspective, with the emphasis being on trade and investment flows. The economic integration efforts have been successful, and a large number of people are participating in the growth process. In the same way, though, many of these countries are still very backward economically and socially, having fallen far behind those who benefited from free trade. Many of them have not been able to benefit from the welfare state or social protection systems that were so prominent in former decades.

For example, in Latin America, there is evidence that the structural adjustment programs have had little effect on poverty levels, since they were meant to be a form of redistribution that would benefit the poor. However, this policy was discontinued more than forty years ago, when there was an increase in income inequality. Consequently, poverty rates have increased, especially in Brazil and Argentina. On the other hand, Mexico has suffered from severe poverty, because it has relied on the export of its agricultural products to the United States, Europe, Australia and other developed countries. More generally, although it is true that some countries in Central and South America do not have the resources to invest in social development, it does not follow that they should not benefit as a result of being in a richer position than the countries that have done so. It is only necessary to point out that, for example:
It is also worth pointing out the remarkable fact that there have always been poor countries such as India, whose development has been much hampered by its dependence on foreign countries, such France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Portugal. Although the existence of a strong economy makes it possible to develop a social system, no country has succeeded in developing a long-lasting social structure (Kumar, 2000).
With regard to Africa, unfortunately, African countries have experienced the reverse phenomenon. Their economic growth has depended on imports from other countries and did not lead to an equitable redistribution of wealth. As a consequence, Africa’s poverty rate has increased. Not surprisingly, Africans have suffered less under the African Community, which was created in 1963. Therefore, I argue that it may be necessary, if we want to prevent the increase of poverty among Africans, to continue the efforts to reintegrate Africa into the EU. A part of this is the promotion of policies to encourage the internationalization of African economies. Other parts are the extension of free movement of workers and the granting of quotas to African states, until they have achieved equality with EU member states. Finally, another part is establishing the principle of common citizenship, so that all EU members will be able, eventually, without difficulty to send their citizens to other EU countries to work, live and learn. Such a policy could also have a considerable impact on African internal dynamics and could help in terms of gaining support from African peoples for the development of their own democratic transition. Thus, my thesis is that new forms of European integration may become necessary in Africa in order to put in place the conditions for opening up the continent to Europeanization. To illustrate this, let me present some facts. First, take the case of Morocco. During the years of Arab conquest, Moroccans were subjected to numerous forms both of oppression and deprivation, namely the imposition of Islamic law, forced conversion to Islam and segregation. Later, as the Arab conquests spread throughout North Africa and then the Maghreb, these regimes were finally overthrown and Morocco became independent. Unfortunately, despite the long period of independence, Morocco has not achieved the status of an EU nation-state, mainly due to problems with corruption and mismanagement. Moreover, at the moment, few countries of Africa are considered to have “European” characteristics, hence the impossibility of implementing policies that promote EU integration. For example – the recent elections in Tunisia, where a leader of Islamist group that seeks to establish an Islamic theocracy lost to a representative of another political party. Similarly, France has tried to adopt the image of ‘being Europe‟ by adopting Euro-Mediterranean flags, often appearing in posters in Mediterranean countries along with European and American flags. One of those flags is „the european flag‖, used by France in official ceremonies, events and in films. Another one is called   the Spanish flag ‌‌and shows a red cross over a white background, associated with Spain. These two flags are meant as an insult to Spain‒a fact which has contributed to popular opposition to any EU association. But the most serious problem is corruption, something that occurs in all administrations, but particularly in those of countries where there are huge interests in protecting the † inflated values of property. Fortunately, some measures have recently been taken to check these phenomena, notably by imposing regulations against public spending for ‡ public authorities"
"How Much Choice is Too Much? Whether it applies to curriculum or vouchers, career paths or"," school options, the answer varies widely from person to person. This isn’t so surprising when we consider that the key difference between the two lies in the amount and type of choice available:

1) A Choice-Based Curriculum – Most curricula are designed based on a predefined set of “best practices” derived from other fields, such as medical/biomedical science, economics, or psychology. In other words, because there are only so many different options in each field, people have very little ability to discover their own unique path. The result is that, for example, a medical professional with a high IQ could easily become an accountant; similarly, someone with good math skills could become a doctor. Therefore, you cannot be guaranteed that every potential student will receive the same level of support.
2) An Enrollment System – The majority of higher education institutions charge tuition based upon the number of applicants, not the quality of their students. (In fact, many universities require a $10,000 application fee to start the application process). If a prospective student meets the minimum qualifications to attend a specific institution, they are admitted without regard to their ability, especially if they haven‘t had any previous exposure to the subject area. As a result, graduates often have trouble getting into certain schools, and then find themselves at a disadvantage compared to other students who actually did manage to get into the school of one“s choosing. Not surprisingly, this is the most common source of educational inequality today. For example: New York University, Princeton University and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts graduate almost no others. Ironically, these schools are the ones that attract those who want to be teachers. So, if you want a career in teaching, your best bet is probably to go to New School or Brown. However, having been through this process yourself, my advice would be to check out the statistics and work from there. Many of these institutions will admit more applicants with the intent of helping them get in, than they will with an intention of excluding them. Simply put, colleges and universities don‟t make you an option. They are trying to figure out who they should give admission to first. By contrast, voucher programs do offer choices to students—so much so that it‚Äôs hard to tell which one offers the best bang for your buck. Although the majority use the voucher system, it does vary from school to school. Just because you end up in one school doesn‽ï¹½t mean you„á‖ll win the lottery. Ultimately, though, there is no way to know which program will give you the greatest chance of success."
The Legal Reasoning in Lawrence and the Prospect of Social Change The case of Lawrence v Texas is considered to be," one of the most important legal developments in its time. In it, the Texas legislature was asked to declare its intention to ban same-sex marriage. The state supreme court (SCOTUS) ruled that it could not, and that any law passed in such a way would be void. This is the first time that the majority of judges on the SCOTUS have ruled against same sex marriage legislation. More importantly, this is one reason why social change will never come to America. Any attempt to legalize same gender marriage would result in a ruling that would allow religious freedom to continue unchecked. Many people believe that this will happen because of a religious right type mindset, with the government essentially dictating what they believe to them. Nothing could be further from the truth.



Many Religious People Want Same Sex Marriage

Living up to Constitutional Standards The United States employs a structure of governance that places," the Constitution above all other sources. This was made explicit in the U.S. Constitution by the First Amendment, which states: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,…” (Amendment I).

The Constitution provides that it is the ‘supreme Law of the Land’, and that any state law falling short of this is void. In other words, it has declared that the state is above the Federal Constitution. The Federal government does not have the power to create a new state or abolish one.
Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, took a similar stance when he wrote an article stating that „government is founded on the consent of its governed“. He then moved to declare that there was no authority under his state constitution to ban gay marriage. [2] It is these sorts of policies that our founding fathers envisioned for our country. Unfortunately, today it appears that this will not be the case. For example, a federal court in Michigan ruled that a law forbidding ″discrimination against gays and lesbians″ in public accommodations would be void because it fails to meet the standard established by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Sebelius. (See ‚The Lawsuit: Courts in Ohio Cannot Ban Gay Marriage‘). These sorts are being enacted in several states with the support of governors and legislatures who believe they know better than our nation‟s Founders. We are becoming a nation where people are encouraged to legislate morality as they see fit. Although the majority of people do not agree with this, politicians often use this to their advantage. Therefore, we should be especially careful about what moral standards we uphold and why. Just as the government must work within the confines of certain laws, those laws should also be based on what the Founders intended. Our country was founded to be a republic, not a monarchy. That is why the states were required to adopt a constitution, but the most important document for us to understand is our Constitution, written by men who were well intentioned. Many of us forget that, until now, our government has done much more harm than good. Fortunately, you can help us achieve the kind of society we want.

A Constitutional Republic
Americans should remember that we are a constitutional republic. All of our laws come from a written Constitution that is ratified by two-thirds of Congress. Every state in America has adopted the same form of government that was designed by our Founding Fathers. They had the intent to have a government structured in such a way that each state was given a voice and could set its own policies. Because our Founders wanted the federal government to run things, they created the Articles of Confederation to divide up the responsibilities. Each state had to write its state laws so that every man, woman, child, couple, business, etc. could have an equal say in matters affecting their lives. Throughout history, every time a president has been elected, congress has voted to send the president back to the House of Representatives for a vote. There is only one place where a person can vote for someone else. Under this system, no one is allowed to vote against another person. If a majority vote to reelect a leader, that person is elected. Period. Thus, each person has a say over how their life affects the collective body.



"
German Surrender of Autonomy to Fascism National Socialism in Germany is often viewed as a unique," product of the German past and its relationship to National Socialist ideology, but its origins are more complex. The Nazi movement had roots well before the war, with the so-called ""Jewish Question"" that had first surfaced in the 1890s. Although the National Socialists' early aims were to establish an Aryan homeland, they were also keenly aware of their potential to undermine German power in any form. In order to accomplish their ends, the Nazis were driven by the desire for national expansion, especially in response to the Russian revolution and in order for Adolf Hitler to re-establish a sense of German nationhood. However, Hitler was also driven not only by his own ambitions, although that was key, nor did he stop at merely gaining access to power. He wanted to be a leader who would be remembered as the most successful of all leaders of his time. This drove him to seek a powerful military force and to perfect his plans to achieve this goal.

Hitler's military leadership
The German Army during the First World War was one of Europe's most powerful forces, having been heavily influenced by German nationalism and a strong belief that it could hold on to Germany's borders and keep the peace. Under the command of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Germany had the fourth largest army in all of warfare, over twice the size of its British and French opponents. Hindenberg's strategy was based on two principles. Firstly, his strategy involved concentrating on the defense of strategic points along Germany’s borders. Secondly, he believed that through rapid mobilization and rapid procurement, it was possible to move quickly into Germany, taking advantage of a large population, and then utilize the resources of an entire continent to conquer the enemy. Both of these strategies were employed extensively during WWII, though not without severe repercussions. For example, Hindenburg's first move against Italy in February 1943 was an indirect blow to Mussolini‘s already weak position. When Italy's main army was defeated in June 1943, Italy became isolated from its resources, forced to surrender, eventually losing almost half of Italy‟s territory. More generally, when fighting in France, Britain and the U.S., the Germans were unable to launch any significant attacks because they had to divert their forces to defensive positions, such as to block the allied forces from advancing. Had the Japanese launched simultaneous attacks on all three countries, no one would have survived. It was a similar story in Italy, where Germany was able to defend its territory but the Allies could not. Finally, in 1940, while preparing for a possible attack on Poland, Nazi Germany began planning to invade western Europe, bypassing Russia and even Switzerland. Due to this, many in Nazi Europe felt betrayed by their leaders. Having seen how easily the British were captured and defeated by British technology, most believed they would lose. Therefore, some began to support a war of independence against the Anglo-Saxon powers. With Hitler‌s support, those who saw the invasion of Poland as an opportunity to begin to break away from the Empire, began looking for other ways to spread the “German spirit.” This included the idea of creating a ‹Nazi-type of government› or ′Nazi Empire※ to replace the existing British regime. Through the efforts of Erich Ludendorff, who established the Office of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, various plans were developed to implement this plan. Ultimately, however, little changed. Despite these changes, something else was changing. Many people were realizing that Hitler meant what he said. Some began thinking that he was actually a good guy, someone who truly cared about his people. These people started to question the long-term goals of Hitler, which were much different than what Hitler originally had in mind. Additionally, since the beginning of World  War I, there had been rumors that the Kaiser and other German leaders were involved in secret schemes to expand their power, mainly in Africa and Asia. Now, after WWI, these people began asking why the Reich needed to fight so many foreign wars. Not only did this cause some people to fear the potential of being next in line to lead Germany; it also caused others to start thinking of whether or not the Nazi program was worth the cost. By the end of WWII (1939), the question of why Germany fought so aggressively in WWII had become a hot topic for discussion and debate. Throughout the years, events have shown that there was no consensus among the leaders and soldiers. History will never know the answer to that question, because no matter how much the truth of anything is revealed, you can never rule out the possibility that someone will be able change history in some way.




It is probably safe to say that most people today realize that Adolf Eichmann was absolutely wrong about what happened during World War II, despite his claim to"
"The Role of Party Identification in Voting Behavior: Is There Room for Issue and Candidate Evaluation? Noted American political scientist V. O. Key, Jr. once stated,"," ""In the last few elections, voter registration is the most significant factor that makes up a voter's decision whether or not to vote for one candidate over another.""

(1) In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could choose who they allowed to be elected to represent their citizens. The Court decided that each state has the right to decide which voters are allowed onto the ballot. (2) A similar ruling was made by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in 2004. In that case, NorthCarolina's legislature passed an act that basically gave voters the same right as candidates to run for office.
No one can say that the decision was a mistake or a lapse in judicial discretion because there was no court-ordered requirement that voters register with the state or any other party organization to qualify for the primary election. This decision represents a vast expansion of the existing rights of voters. More on this later.


A Note from Professor O'Keefe:
I have a lot to say about this, but I am running behind in time. Please help me out by reading the entire article at: http://www.dcs.vcu.edu/~kuehle/pdf/oekedd.pdf. Just keep in mind that I do not speak for any of us. Many of these questions cannot be answered definitively without knowing the specific details of a specific election - such as the kind of precinct, who registered to cast his/her ballot, when did it occur and under what circumstances. It is simply impossible to know all of this information before the election takes place. Therefore, my comments may be a little confusing and complicated. My hope is that you will find the information helpful and that it will encourage you to continue your independent research. -- Vito O""Keefe. Email: vokie@oc.uky.EDU.ORG

Dale Oechsler: Hello and welcome to today's D.C. Forum on Electoral Reform. I'm Dale Oehdecker, Dean of Academic Affairs and Associate Vice Provost for Research and Graduate Education. Welcome to the Forum. Our discussion is taking place in three sessions. First, let me ask you a few questions about what we've talked about so far. Did you catch that issue of The New York Times that just came out, which describes how the Georgia Supreme Courts overturned a federal law that had forced a statewide election? What were the two judges who wrote that opinion? And why did they do that? The Georgia Court said that voting is different than registering to make a living. That is something that we really need to talk about. And I want to tell you about another thing, because I know you're very interested in this subject. What happens when a judge issues a ruling that's based on the wrong reasoning? That's a very important question. So I'd like to start with that. When a court decides that a law is unconstitutional, does that mean that every other judge in the district is bound to follow suit and ignore it? Of course not. But many of them are. Now, you mentioned the New School of Public Communications. Are there any members of that school currently on our staff? Yes. Alumni of ours have left, some of whom are still here today. How about you, Do you have any experience with this issue? It's quite a complicated one, especially in terms of how people make sense of social reality. One of our goals is to understand the ways in which human beings process information about themselves and society in order to form appropriate moral judgments. To do this we conduct a large number of interviews and focus groups with people of different ages, races, ethnicities, education levels and professions. As I mentioned earlier, we also conduct surveys and ask participants to rank things like fairness, honesty, predictability, legitimacy, credibility, validity, trustworthiness, consistency, dependability and accuracy. All of those are important factors in making informed decisions and all sorts of other judgments that are necessary in life. We always try to emphasize that, although we don't know the answers to these kinds of questions, people should rely on what they hear and read about and think about when they go into a voting booth. Anyhow, I'll skip ahead to some background on how this happened. Back in 2005 the plaintiffs filed suit against Georgia, claiming that they had been disenfranchised by a state law enacted in 1991. Under that law, counties could only approve voter registrations in their respective counties. If a county approved a registration request, it had to forward that registration to a central registrar in Atlanta. A central database would then compile the names, dates of birth, race, sex, addresses, and other basic demographic information of Georgia's voters"
"Theories of Legal Constraint There are three major theories, legal constraint, sincere preferences and"," the theory of social choice. Legal constraint is the most widely discussed theory. In this paper I will briefly summarize the key ideas behind this theory in terms of the way it applies to particular models and then make some predictions about what happens when we apply it to real world problems. The main features of legal constraints are that it involves a form of freedom, with the freedom being the right to be free to choose. This means that if you have a particular desire (for example, wanting a large piece of watermelon) then you cannot be prevented from getting that desire without breaking the law. Although the specific content of these desires can vary, the essence of a legal system is that its laws restrict your freedom to act. It is important to point out that any law is only a law if it makes you free, for example if a government gives you a license to run a marathon. Therefore, a common objection to this type of theory is simply that there is not enough freedom in such a system. However, although we cannot always get away with this, there are many situations in which one can find a situation in an actual legal environment where one wants to take the risk of doing something illegal. For example suppose that I want a long drink of lemonade but I do not want to drink anything alcoholic. Suppose further that my friend says to me, 'You know you could get into trouble if people found out.' One could imagine that by virtue of his moral beliefs I could follow him down the road and say, because he believes that alcohol is a harmful substance, I should not drink any alcohol at all. What I would like to know is whether I can be held to a similar moral responsibility as the friend in the previous paragraph. Note however that even if I am able to do so, it may not be possible for me to get around the effect of my beliefs in a genuine way. I might be able in principle to overcome the threat of being prosecuted for violating a criminal law, but it is highly doubtful that under ordinary circumstances I have the resources to avoid the possibility of punishment. Our attitudes are influenced by many other factors as well, such as our personality, our religious beliefs, and our financial position. Consequently, no matter how much I believe that drinking alcohol should be illegal, once I become wealthy I may be inclined to behave differently. If we think of ourselves as a community, then we have an obligation to each other to encourage each person to pursue their own happiness and maximize their personal wellbeing. Many people have different values, therefore they need to understand what each individual person is trying to achieve. We need also to agree on what the common good is and what it consists of. To decide what is best for each of us is to decide how we should live together. Ultimately, we need ethical principles to guide our conduct. A strong moral basis is needed to justify our decision. So far, various moral arguments have been put forward in support of or against such principles. But unfortunately, those arguments are often founded on misunderstandings, errors and faulty reasoning. Fortunately, some theorists have tried to develop an ethical basis for moral principles within the framework of law and ethics. As far as legal theory goes, one of them has been Michael Walzer's theory which is called 'theory of legality'. According to Walz, lawful conduct must be based on facts. Facts are facts which are true or false. They are not merely opinions. An opinion is defined as 'an assertion about a fact or events which contains no information about the truth or falsity of that assertion'. An assertion is regarded as non-assertive when it does not contain information concerning the state of affairs. Just as we judge a man's courage by his willingness to fight rather than by the amount of physical strength displayed by him, so we assess a person's morality by considering his intentions, not the actions he takes. Walzers' definition of an assertion includes a description of what needs to exist before an assessment of morality can go ahead. Someone who states that 'I am not a terrorist' is stating a nonclaim. Non-claims are claims that are considered equivalent to statements of fact. Whenever there appears to someone to speak or do something that is illegal or immoral, that person commits an illegal act or commits a immoral act, according to the Walzeers' theory, irrespective of whether or not they actually intend to violate the laws or norms. More generally, Walzes argue that every act is an act of coercion, since it requires the use of force and harm to another. Any kind of intentional coercion is wrong, hence unlawful, though it can never be justified. These two propositions are the basis of Walzen's general theory: first, every action is unlawful and second, an action which requires force or harm can only be taken as an unlawful action. Now, consider the following scenario: I step out"
Transitional Justice?: The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Socio-economic Rights Reconciliation means that those who have been on the underside," of society are being positioned in the middle, no longer as the downtrodden, but as those whom we should be proud to call ‘ourselves’. This will produce a new definition of “justice” and a renewed sense of optimism about South Africa‟s ability to progress.

"The Countermajoritarian Myth Countermajoritarianism, depending on who you ask, is either the justification"," of a totalitarian regime (e.g., in Nazi Germany) or a form of terrorism (or both), or simply a failure to understand the basic principles of democracy. The first and second groups of people have an obvious similarity with the third and fourth groups, although the fourth group's ignorance of the theory of democratic government leads them to be worse than all of these groups combined.

A common misconception about totalitarianism is that it requires that there be a dictatorship. This is not so. In fact, totalitarian regimes generally have a range of different forms of government, each of which tends to have its own distinctive features and can work in different areas. If you think of society as a battlefield, you would expect to see a war of sorts taking place between the parties engaged in the war, with one side being the regime that is winning the fight and the other side becoming more ruthless and violent in its efforts to undermine that regime. It seems that under such circumstances the loser of this war is likely to become more totalitarian than the winners. So if you're seeking to characterize the nature of totalitarian states, it makes sense to talk about what they are fighting against. For example, if Hitler was fighting the Russian Communist Party, he would be calling for his enemies to adopt the same authoritarian form as the government that he was trying to defeat. Or, when we speak of Hitler, let's say he wanted the German Democratic Republic, or HRE, to replace the Kaiser-Deutsche Reich, now known as Germany, because he saw the latter regime as having been responsible for the Holocaust. Under such an interpretation, Hitler would not want to associate himself with any regime other than HWE, since he sees the HSE as not being responsible enough. As far as I can tell, nobody has suggested that Hitler wants a fascist government or that the Nazis are trying some new form here. Therefore, no one has argued that Nazi totalitarianity must involve the kind of thing that I have described above. Actually, the only explanation for why the Germans were so obsessed with that form over others is the absence of anything like a similar obsession with democracies in other countries. That's because they know that democracies are dangerous to their enemies. They know full well that they cannot trust democracy itself, nor can they trust it in time of war. Democracy is too prone to betrayal, assassination, violence, nepotism and cronyism. And they had no illusions about the possibility of their own victory. Nor do they need to; they have plenty of time to rebuild their power and influence before the next conflict erupts. But after the last conflict they tend to think that perhaps the enemy is more rational and reasonable than they were in prior conflict. Consequently, they believe that their opponent will act in a way that makes them more secure and powerful. Put simply, democracy is dangerous because it is a risk for dictators. Given that, Nazi tyranny is much safer than a regime based on democratic principles. After all, many dictators are able to rule without resort to force because the majority of citizens are still alive, and despite their obvious weakness and folly, most of them are not willing to risk their lives to preserve a leader who is incompetent and rotten to the core. Additionally, few dictators come into power because of some great military strength or some other kind factor that would make them attractive to voters, who tend toward the status quo. Their power is rooted in their ability to manipulate the minds of large numbers of simpletons. Once they figure out that democracy isn't a panacea, once they understand that its dangers are manifold and that even a moderately democratic regime can be overthrown by terrorists, then they begin to fear the loss of power, not because democracy won't save them, but rather because there is something fundamentally wrong with it. When Hitler became chancellor, for example -- given that his power was based largely on the support of his followers -- he began to realize that if he were to lose power at some point in his lifetime, someone else might take his place. Many of those people were the followers of another leader, such as Goebbels. He thought that Goering was a better candidate for chancellor than himself, whose ideas seemed somewhat less extreme. Although Goerge's ideas did not lead to fascism, eventually Goegish ideas were accepted by the National Socialist movement, which took power in 1933. By the end of 1935, nearly two-thirds of German voters believed that Adolf Hitler should have been chancellor. A year later, 70 percent of Germans said Hitler represented the best chance for Germany to overcome its economic problems. Had Hitler lost power by 1932, however, his position would have gone down to 60 percent, suggesting that very few Germans would support him. Not surprisingly, those who supported him were often men from middle-class backgrounds, mostly farmers and small-town laborers, while those"

Introduction
1. The first British rulers of the subcontinent took their roots from a mixture of Hindu-Muslim and Christian ideas, though some were of a Buddhist or Brahmanic origin. It is only over a hundred years since they entered the mainstream of political life and the British were the most powerful nation in the world. In fact, the history of their dominion can be traced back to almost a thousand years before the birth of Christ and covers various periods from pre-historic times to the modern day. Many of these early kings were monarchs of an ancient kingdom called 'the Mughal Empire'.
The early Muhajirs (so-called because they ruled Mysore) were a sub-division of Hindus who migrated to India from Central Asia. They had their origins in Kashmir and were considered one branch of Indo-European origin, with the Sanskrit root word moktan referring to their occupation.
But it was only in 1857 that the so-named 'Muhallim' (Mughul emperors) came into power in Mumbra (modern day Meerut). They were succeeded by the Maharaja, whose son was known as the Raja. This Rajas was a member of several dynasties including that of Rajendra Chola, Maharana Pratap, Krishnadeva Maharaj, and then Akbar. These were all of royal lineage. Akbarnama, who ruled a large territory in western Andhra, was an independent ruler and this territory was one of his greatest achievements. He became known throughout India as 'Akbar the Great'. The historical Akbars also reigned over Delhi, which was then the capital of Delhi State, ruled by Maharani Udaya Devi, daughter of AkBaramah. Uda was the mother of Bhishma and Hanuman. She was also an ardent supporter of Lord Rama. Finally, there was another ruler, named Ghiyath. Ghoja, or Ghora, is a modern term used to refer to this ruler. His chief achievement was that he gave control of Mehrangarh, a district on the bank of Yamuna river, to Gwalior State. Meghraj is another name for Ghat in Varanasi.Ghera, literally meaning great river or great watercourse, refers to Yamunashree's conquest of Tibet.Khalq is the third ruler of Muyal. Khalq means royal. But it is actually a corruption of Khalchaura or Khalga.The Mulsims (Mohallas) are the fourth line of Indian rulers. Mohalla is one who is called Mahalali. Mahala is like 'father' or 'grandfather'. Mohalis were often hereditary rulers, especially in Bengal where many are still called Mulya (literally 'greatest').
In the early nineteenth century, when British began their expansion in India, they established many places of residence for British officials. There were many administrative posts and these places included, but were not limited to, cantonments, gurkhas, zamindars, temple courts, jails, tehsils, etc. Under British rule, temples were being built in such large numbers that they formed the basis of later Hindu institutions. Subsequently, Hinduism developed into its modern forms. So, it has been said that British influence on Indian society dates back almost seven centuries.2. Early English rulers saw themselves as a representative of ancient Vedic civilisation. Englishmen saw the Hindus as possessing deep, profound religious beliefs and a similar outlook on life. Both groups recognised the same fundamental unity in all aspects of life - religion, ethics, customs, language, literature, ritual, cosmology, mythology, philosophy, science, technology, business, trade and administration. England recognized the antiquity of Vedas (the sacred books of Vishnu), as well as other ancient Hindu literatures like Puranas (literature of Purusha or Prakriti, god Shiva), Ramayana, Mahabharata and Mahasabha (stories of Gods). These scriptures have a common theme, namely, karma or reincarnation. Therefore, these ancient forms of wisdom, religion and spirituality were accepted by both Hindus and English alike.3. British authority was based on English language. Although the two languages were different, people living in different parts of Britain understood one another. Thus, for example, British people could understand Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,"
Experience as History Evge'nia Ginzburg's Journey Into the Whirlwind provides an intimate portrait," of a singular life. This groundbreaking book is the most comprehensive account yet of an incredible woman, who transformed a life-threatening illness into an enduring legacy.

As a young girl, Eva was abandoned by her mother. The family lived in poverty, with the mother dying shortly after Eva's birth. She grew up in what amounted to the equivalent of ""camp"" until she met Gustaf Tromp. They married in 1941 and were soon living in Switzerland. In 1943, Tlof Tuckman was recruited from World War II service to serve in the U.S. military as a medic during the Korean war. He saw the devastation and despair of his countrymen and brought the experience of war directly home to Eva. Through her love for him, she overcame her own emotional limitations and became a writer. After the war, their marriage collapsed and Tackerman took a teaching position at New York University. It was during those years that Eva wrote ""As We Lay Dying.""
Tackleman's wife and two daughters were killed in a car crash, when the car they were traveling in collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. As a result, Mrs. Tacksman had to be taken to New Hampshire Hospital for psychiatric treatment. During this time, Ege's medical condition deteriorated even further. Although her body was already weak, on March 23, 1955, the day she turned thirty-six, a doctor declared her brain to have a severe case of dementia. A stroke followed quickly, and her mental ability gradually went from normal to near the point of being incapacitated. By the fall of 1955 she was only partially conscious and had lost her ability to speak or move her eyes. Her condition was pronounced to no longer be a medical necessity. (A year earlier she had suffered a serious heart attack and given up all hope of recovery.) On December 3, 1959, at a Veterans' Hospital in Haddam, Connecticut, her condition suddenly deteriorated and she died.




Ege began writing a memoir of her childhood and early years in 1945. Shortly thereafter her health began to decline and a diagnosis of lung cancer was made. Throughout the winter and spring she worked on her memoirs and then returned to writing fiction. Between 1950 and 1953, while Euge was recovering from a stroke, Gustavo Dudamel was photographing her with her daughter on their honeymoon. Dudmel knew her as Maria Tackerman. Both of them enjoyed her writing, but he found her ""difficult,"" according to one witness. But after she recovered, he approached her about an adaptation of Maria's memoir into film. Eges friend said ""she felt so ashamed of herself that it hurt to tell her."" The film project never materialized. Ultimately, Dudel moved to Mexico in 1951 and Eueneze returned back to America in 1954. Neither she nor Dudgelmm ever wrote another book. Finally, in 1962, they got together with Dudelees wife to write her autobiography. At the same time they also wrote Eufemismos, which was published in 1981. Their mutual appreciation of each other's work kept the two together. Years later, though, as Dudels death approached, his wife realized that Euereze could not live without her husband. Therefore, although Eieze was aware of the impending death, having been through so many deaths since she first fell ill, nonetheless she wanted to preserve the memory of him. Due to this, over the years they would get together once a week for a meal, where she would read some chapters of their shared writings and ask him about the meaning of certain words. When she wasn't reading he would do the dishes and clean up afterward. Once Dudellees death was imminent, however, eventually Euaze left her apartment and returned home. And now, nearly ten years later still, there was no reunion. Many years passed and still no word. Eventually, someone finally asked her if she might be interested in visiting Dudeling house. However, because Eaeze did not want her to know that he was dead, no one offered to let her in. No one even knew where Dudeland was. One of Eupeze friends told her that she should have stayed away because she needed to stay away. Another friend worried about her safety, saying how could someone be walking down the street with such a body bag? Finally her children told Eapeze that they had something to show her. Someone had left a note on a chair in her home and told him that, for the past several weeks, Ola Eulee had been coming to their home every night to visit. His wife had disappeared. Suddenly, just days before the letter arrived, Edie Tackingman discovered Eoeze's body lying in state in their bed, beside her wife"
"Power and the Urban Center Having, maintaining and controlling power is critical for governments, businesses,"," communities and other institutions. This is especially true of large organizations with substantial control over a city's public spaces, such as the government of a large metropolitan area or a major city.

In the past, when cities were established, it was often in response to physical needs (e.g., industry growth). With the advent of transportation, however, cities have become more complex and have a greater need for power. Although the modern city has had some technological progress and innovations in power management, its physical structure is still based on an individual's ownership of land. In fact, the most common form of urban power in the United States today is the privately owned, self-governed city, with the majority of the population being concentrated in urban centers. The average person living in a rural community is only about 14% of their neighbor's neighbors, and that's not because they don't know each other, but rather because the neighborhoods are too far apart to be physically connected. Many people living outside of metropolitan areas, therefore, live alone, which has a serious negative impact on the quality of life for these folks. Finally, since the cities are centralized, they tend to resist change, even when there is evidence to support such change. City government is thus very vulnerable to political influence. These factors mean that cities require a lot of power to operate. It takes a strong, organized, centralized system, capable of providing good governance, to maintain and control power, especially in light of significant economic, financial, cultural and political change taking place in both private and public spheres. Cities also have great economic strengths, as they are able to leverage and expand their existing economies through tourism, business, manufacturing, housing, education, retail, trade and recreation. They are also able use their location to attract new customers and keep existing customers. More importantly, though, these cities must also be able protect themselves from external threats including state or local governments as well as from other potentially disruptive forces such corporate mergers, terrorist attacks, war or other kinds of violent conflict. As a result, many cities in all parts of America are highly integrated, vertically oriented and hierarchical. Centralization of authority within one domain means that power moves between the two domains, making the city a powerful political entity. Because of this, city leaders must be elected by constituents, who are drawn to the values of openness, transparency, collaboration and civic engagement. Consequently, those who want to run for mayor or city council should have experience in managing power at a larger scale. Both Democrats and Republicans should be candidates; however much they share the same ideology, voters will remember that they represent the views of those whom they serve. Therefore, you can't expect someone to win without showing competence in running for office, something that a typical politician can never do. Simply put, power corrupts and absolute power remains necessary in any institution, no matter how large or small. However, because of its centralized structure, once power becomes centralized and consolidated in one place, there really isn't any incentive for either parties to seek out another seat. Ultimately, having an organized bureaucracy, whether it be a government agency, board or committee, is a necessary component of effective power because it will make it easier to manage power among different branches of government. Additionally, although we've talked about power being decentralized in technology, politics can be taken to another level, namely that it can become centralized: For example, let's say a company is trying to convince investors to invest in its stock. Investors are already sold on what they believe is an excellent company. Now, instead of having to prove that the company actually makes money, now they can merely show that their money is being spent in an efficient manner. Not only that, if the organization is successful, companies will want access to their power again. Technological advances make centralized power much more difficult than it used to seem. For instance, look at how people talk about electric power sources. Everyone seems to agree that electricity is produced by burning coal, hydroelectric power comes from dams, nuclear power from atomic bombs, solar power relies on sunlight and wind power uses water. Yet, while all of these technologies are considered ""green"" in terms of generating power using renewable sources, few seem to understand that these techniques are inefficient, expensive and environmentally destructive. Just think of all the jobs that would be lost in replacing coal-fired power plants, dam construction, water pumps and turbines. Water is one of our primary resources, yet it is also the source of much of pollution. There is simply no way to generate electricity from a water source, so we end up having just as much pollution as we do from fossil fuels. So if you're trying your best to promote a green company, focus on cleaning up polluted waters, not arguing about how to produce electricity. Given that our nation is heavily dependent on fossil fuel energy, politicians should"
"midterm, law and public policy/ constitutional law Question 1B. Because the new provision addresses political speech, any"," political views expressed may not be used against the candidate. The law does not prohibit all candidates from making or advocating their own views. In fact, the law allows candidates to express their views without offending their political adversaries. However, candidates who express themselves in such a way as to offend their enemies cannot run for office. They are subject to criticism from their opponent's supporters. This is the intent of the provision.

Question 2. Section 11-35-23.2 prohibits candidates (including the nominee) from ""making or publicly advocating statements that indicate support for or opposition to"" certain political candidates. Questions about these statements include questions about:
(1) the source of support;
A. what the statement represents; and
B.. whether the statements are true or false. [As a consequence, a candidate is not required to tell the truth when saying a negative endorsement.]
QUESTION #2A Does a statement that a person is opposed to a specific candidate for public office represent the person's position?
Answer: It does. A statement like this would be a violation of Section 5-52-129 of Title 5, Agriculture Code, for a member of a committee representing the public interest to communicate with the committee members about a matter in which the member has an interest. Under Section 7-5-103 of that code, it would violate Section 1-9-108 of Chapter 12 of Division 1 of Part 2 of this title if a representative of any class of persons were to state his or her opinion on a particular matter. Any statement made by a public official concerning a subject within the knowledge of him or herself which is false, likely to be interpreted as a falsehood, and which would not normally be understood as expressing an opinion, is prohibited by section 11 through 13 of Article I of State Constitution. Additionally, if the government or any agency of government, board, commission, or other agency, makes a written request to another governmental body to investigate a concern or dispute, such action is a failure to act, which gives rise to cause for disciplinary action under article 4 of chapter 6 of division 8 of part 2 entitled ""Discipline of Public Officials,"" and is treated as an ""official action"" by the same article. Therefore, anyone who makes misleading statements about the qualifications of candidates for statewide office in any manner that would constitute a breach of ethics rules is guilty of misconduct. That being said, although there are exceptions, no candidate who is elected to any office shall commit a similar offense.""
It is obvious that the Legislature intended that only candidates should be prohibited from discussing issues in matters of public importance. Candidates should not use their position as candidates merely to convey their personal beliefs about matters they believe to belong in the realm of politics. Other than the exception in question, there is no other authority that permits a direct discussion of issues outside of an election between parties. Both sides of every election are allowed to raise and discuss issues pertaining to their respective party platforms. Neither side is allowed at any time to discuss any issue that is outside the scope of its platform. One can discuss a possible alternative to the platform but he or she must explain why it is inconsistent with that platform so as not to run afoul of section 15-17-130 of 1978 Acts. Furthermore, one can make comments about an issue during the campaign but nothing more. There is simply no authority for someone to talk about issues after a primary election and then go into the general election campaign criticizing the opposing candidate's stance on those issues. Simply put, you cannot talk directly about political issues during an actual election. Nor is there anything that prohibits a prospective candidate from speaking about important issues at an open meeting of voters, even if that voter is opposing the proposed candidate because he believes the positions of his choice to represent him would allow him to accomplish more things in Washington. Certainly, neither the candidates nor the voters are harmed in this regard. But there was no reason for the legislature to prevent candidates or voters from openly talking about serious political topics. By allowing candidates and voters to speak freely about major political subjects, we ensure that our state is open to intelligent discussion and debate. Our goal is to ensure a free exchange of ideas between the two parties and to encourage the widest possible involvement by all members of society in civic activities. To that end, this statute clearly protects the quality of life for all Washingtonians by keeping them informed about what is happening in our government and giving them the opportunity to assess the opinions of their representatives. Should any candidate choose to violate this law, he will face severe repercussions from those who are elected next term.


Citing State v. R.B., 25 Wash.App. 374, 607 P.3d 1061 (2000), the dissent claims that it has no standing to assert that section 19-22-109 violates the First"
Direct vs. Indirect Effects of the Supreme Court Today the Supreme Court is often seen as wielding a," “subtle” power, but the most powerful aspect of its current decision could also have far-reaching implications on the U.S. economy. The decision by the Court can determine whether and to what extent the government must pay for social security benefits and other government benefits.

A few weeks ago, I blogged about how important it is that the federal government make its payments to Social Security based on income. In fact, if you want to know why the Social Protection Trust Fund is so important, let me just repeat that here: It is the only source of income that directly benefits Americans. This is because the IRS will never issue a direct payment from the trust fund to anyone in the form of a paycheck. But, since the actuary has decided that it will be necessary to pay out the funds over a long period of time, the money goes into a larger pot of taxpayer funds that benefit almost every American. And, those funds are the ones that come into play when a government or state fails to make regular payments into the fund.


It is these large indirect tax receipts that underlie the reason that more than 80% of all Social spending comes from government (as well as other sources, such as interest on government bonds). These indirect contributions, along with the direct government payments, provide the Federal Government with a steady stream of cash flow to operate our nation. As such, this is a crucial step in determining the viability of our fiscal system, because it helps determine who actually makes and spends the dollars we receive. If we don’t make enough of these payments back, it could set us back considerably. Therefore, having the ability to offset the burden of indirect taxes through direct payments should be a high priority for Congress. That is why it was critically important that President Trump came out in favor of an increase in SocialSecurity payroll taxes, which would shift $2.3 trillion from indirect to direct tax collections. However, he added that he still supports the increased taxes on millionaires and billionaires. While I hope that lawmakers will do their part to support President Donald Trump‘s effort to put the deficit on a fiscal path, there is still a lot of work left to be done to close the budget deficit, and that includes putting the social safety net on solid fiscal footing. We need to prevent the erosion of social protection for middle-class Americans, especially those currently receiving the maximum level of benefits available under Socialsecurity. Having no adequate source at all means that families are being left with less than they need; falling short of meeting the bare minimum requirements of Socialbenefits programs. Thus, policymakers should ensure that any increase to the payroll tax will not occur due to political pressure. Other than the one mentioned above, though, adding the additional 1.2 percentage points to indexing rates is probably a no-brainer. Simply put, once the Fed decides that sufficient funds have been built up in Treasury Bonds to continue paying the full amount of dividends to savers, then the entire burden falls upon Congress to raise the taxes needed to keep the program afloat. Fortunately, we already have a plan in place to accomplish this, thanks to some brilliant work by Congressman Jim Renacci (D-New Jersey). I have posted a video of his speech below. Many people have said that they believe that Rep. Rencis plan is unconstitutional and should not be taken seriously. I am not so sure. Certainly, Renci says he believes the plan does not violate the Fifth Amendment. Still, many have questioned whether Renco is actually serious about reforming the way the taxation system works. What is clear is his determination to do whatever it takes to assure that Socialshield benefits are adequately funded. Let me be clear that I do not support any plan that would undermine Social Shield benefits, nor would I ever vote for any measure that tried to undermine them. Our goal is to move forward with SocialShield, not to fail. Please note that, in my opinion, Rep Renicis proposal is not the same thing as a repeal of Medicare. Both of those programs are designed to provide basic medical insurance to millions of seniors. It seems that perhaps RepRenci might be trying to create a loophole where SocialProvident Benefits could get away with not providing any medical benefits at any time. Remember, Socialprovident benefits include health care and nutrition, plus disability and survivor benefits for retired workers. There are also lifetime annuities, life insurance, savings plans, retirement accounts, pension payments and a vast array of other services. For now, however, my position is simply that Medicare and Social Provident Insurance should remain in existence, while Socialprotection continues to exist. My hope is for the House to pass Reprenci‟s proposal and then see what happens in both houses. Until then, hopefully RepRencis will rethink his position and come to understand"
"Hannah Arendt's Conception of Totalitarianism While Hannah Arendt's work, The Origins of Totalitarianism was groundbreaking"," in its use of the history of totalitarianism to inform her analysis of dictatorships and their impact on society. This article examines Aretell's account of totalitarians in terms of her response to Hannah's view that the totalitarian impulse is rooted in a particular kind of people. The article analyzes these two views through Arellian historiographical methods and contrasts Arelli's characterization of Arente's and Hannahs theories of a people as a form of oppression with the way in which Arellah views totalocrats. Areltians have a historical position about what they think of as the ""people"" of their societies. In this article, Arettians see a singular kind or people, who they believe to be a type of person. They identify a specific group of persons as having an ""evil"" influence over the society in question. Through Arellygine historiological methods, they argue that Areattists' view of this people is one of an evil influence. However, other groups of society are good and have an even more ""good"" impact upon the actions of those within their respective societies; they are the ones who are considered ""innocent."" Areiltians refer to this second group as ""bad."" Only the bad are responsible for evil acts. Under this view, the only people responsible are those who hold a ""false"" belief that is the source of evil action. It is this false belief which leads to evil. Therefore, when Hannah argues against the existence of tyrants, she opposes the evil inherent in any leader who assumes power by means of another human's false beliefs. She argues that tyrant leaders act not because they truly believe that they possess the powers of power, but rather because those around them have the false convictions that it is wrong to do so. Consequently, Hannah claims, such leaders cannot be evil tyranarchical leaders at all. To Be an Evil Tyrant is to Hold an Un-Evil Thought. [The Responsibility and Goodness of Those Who Act Evil: Hannah Aarell] Hannah uses her theory of tyranny to support her general claim that any dictator must also be held accountable for his actions. If a dictator thinks he has absolute power and authority over others, then he believes he should have absolute authority and right over those under him. Any tyrant, therefore, must prove that he is indeed the absolute ruler of his country. Hannah contends that this is only possible through the demonstration of good faith, or a willingness to accept responsibility for one's actions (Bucher, 2013, pp. 2-5). She claims that only those individuals who choose to put forth good reasons can deserve to know the truth of why they acted evil in the past. Not all tyhronarchy is bad, although it may seem so at times. Tyrants make mistakes, and these mistakes can be corrected. Should we judge someone from a subjective moral standpoint, we may be led to judge a tyrant not as an individual, nor as merely evil, per se, because he does not sincerely exercise his power to the best of everyone's ability. Although tyrocratic leaders may err, no one else will. (ibid., p. 5) This view allows the tyrant to continue his reign of terror. Just as we can allow people to make small mistakes while they live, so we should give tyros credit for their good intentions, especially those that come from good motives. We should also allow the same thing to happen to tyrontrally motivated tyruaries as they improve their performance. Tyranarchy makes people feel good about themselves and justify their own actions, making the act appear more virtuous. For example, you could say ""well, since she made the mistake of eating that apple, I should now be punished for it"", or ""since you're so good at your job, maybe we shouldn't punish you for your part in failing to prevent this accident"". The tyrant's punishment is thus justified. By allowing people opportunities to fail, life can become more difficult. Many people today have trouble doing anything alone, let alone having fun, playing games, etc. These people have experienced the loss of independence, being left alone to run the household, parents, spouse, siblings, friends, grandparents, strangers, enemies, illnesses, disabilities, broken relationships, financial worries, mental anguish, disappointment, frustration, loneliness, stress, depression, confusion, shame, sadness, despair, fear, anxiety, guilt, remorse, grief, anger, bitterness, rage, humiliation, greed, lust, pride, arrogance, brutality, violence, torture, death, war, terrorism, repression, racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, racialism, classism and all kinds of negative feelings. All these things can cause our minds to wander. Our thoughts get tangled up with these events and images,"
Leave for Family Responsibility in the United States Introduction The second wave of the feminist movement struggled for," years to overcome a long tradition of viewing female agency as a form of domestic labor. In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist intellectuals and activists began to argue that women's labor was at least partially responsible for creating the conditions for men to be successful at work (e.g., see Crenshaw, 1996). In some ways, the fight over agency seemed to end when this old model of female labor came under fire in several feminist journals and academic disciplines. Although many feminists argued that more women were required to supply the resources necessary to sustain an individual woman's productivity, others argued the opposite (for reviews, see Van Zandt, 2013; Turkel, 2015). This period saw the resurgence of feminist theory in both scholarly and popular culture, and these developments led many scholars to reinterpret agency in different ways. The next wave occurred during the 1980s–1990s—which witnessed a renewed focus on the intersection between gender and work, with the inclusion of a wider range of perspectives and theories about work. This second stage of feminism reflected a greater appreciation of agency and its varied forms, as well as the prominence of an emerging understanding of social mobility as being driven by economic status rather than gender. Given this shift in emphasis, scholars have tried to understand how agency has changed and why, especially in relation to the history of gender-related institutions. Not all aspects of society are equally amenable to agency, however. Many women still experience a range or lack of opportunities for personal, familial, professional, or community success, often because they are subjected to unequal access to resources, such as money and education. Some of these disparities are temporary; others endure for generations. Women in some societies face a double bind: while they must work hard to support themselves and their families, they also have a duty to continue working in order to raise their children. Studies of women in developed countries indicate that it is difficult to know whether these two roles are compatible or if it makes no difference which one women choose. To what extent is the decision to work outside the home a sign of independence? What is it in women’s lives that makes them less willing to put in extra hours for a family than men? Why do some women become mothers at a later age than others? And why do women not have the same opportunities to start their own businesses or careers? Understanding these questions from a historical perspective helps us to better understand the state of play of those women who find themselves outside traditional gender roles. More broadly, examining the ways in which gender shapes our understanding and interaction with others can inform broader debates about power, violence, opportunity, inequality, inter-gender relations, citizenship, immigration, global affairs, race, religion, class, nationalism, discrimination, ethics, language, memory, sex, beauty, literature, cinema, performance, technology, nature, art, space, cities, gardens, neighborhoods, communities, schools, hospitals, universities, business, policy, economics, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, theology, politics, war, peace, conservation, development, disaster management, environmental studies, ecology, evolution, geography, geopolitics, history, philosophy, anthropology, cultural history. 2

Introduction In March 2018, after a yearlong investigation of issues related to female employment in France, Marie de Lescure, a researcher at the French Institute for Research in Social Statistics (InrS), identified 8,000 women aged 30–70 employed in private businesses (1). She concluded that “the main reasons for female unemployment are the inability to meet the minimum legal requirements for maternity leave and the absence of career paths available to women.” In fact, she explained, ‘[a]nyone who wants to earn a living should have an apprenticeship [to learn].‟ While the number of unemployed women is much lower than the previous report (3), the level of unemployment among women remains alarmingly high. Indeed, it has been estimated that almost half of all women currently studying in secondary or post-secondary education in Europe are unable to find full-time work within the labour market (2). These statistics, combined with media reports that the wages of young French women are declining (4), suggest that new forms of discrimination against women may be taking hold. As research into the life choices of younger French adults demonstrates, young women make a wide variety of choices regarding where they live and what they do (5), although most of them opt to stay at home (6). They often use their spare time to pursue creative endeavours (7) and to attend school (8), often using their youth and inexperience as an excuse to postpone their decisions about marriage and parenthood. For example, 19 percent of 15-year-olds in Paris are reported to have chosen to study abroad (9), but only 10 percent intend to marry (10). Researchers have found similar levels"
U.S. Civil Liberties Our history has seen a broad range of limitations of," freedom, not the least of which was the restriction of a man's right to liberty. The Civil War and the years that followed led to some of the most profound changes in human rights law in the history of our nation. In the face of these developments, it is only fair for us to reflect on the past and its impact on our civil liberties today. This essay outlines what I consider to be the key elements that have shaped the way in which our country has come to understand our rights in terms of their constitutional dimensions. Many other commentators have described this process as a process of incrementalism. I hope my comments will contribute to this understanding.



1. A process begins by acknowledging that our Constitution was originally intended to protect the fundamental rights of all citizens.2 It then describes how our Nation came to recognize the dignity of human life, protected the sanctity of marriage, safeguarded the freedom of speech, and ensured religious liberty (among others).3 These rights grew out of time and were developed over generations in response to the extraordinary events of 1789 and 1799, when our founding fathers drafted and passed the Bill of Rights.4 The basic text of Section 1 of Article I of that Bill reads:5 We the People of America do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of Americamakers of Arms. SECTION 1. THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, 1791
(1) All persons born or naturalized in any State, who are residents of any part of this Union, are hereby declared to reside where they may be, until they attain their majority; and no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges of said citizens of being heard, nor shall any state deprive any person of life or liberty, without due process or cause thereof; nor deny to any citizen the enjoyment of his religion, or discriminate against him in respect to his civil or political rights; or deny him the equal protection of laws;nor denyto citizens the right of having consented to their own State legislature, being represented therein; Provided That no amendment to said article shall ever be proposed except on payment of an annual tax to support a uniform and adequate system of property, language, trade and judicial procedure. (Emphasis mine.)

Finally, the Constitution went on to declare that the ""right of petitioning the government for a redress of grievances"" was among the rights secured to each individual citizen.9 It thus anticipated the modern recognition that every citizen has a fundamental right under the First Amendment to seek justice from the courts.10 It also provided that Congress could ""pass laws to encourage the maintenance of..."" these rights.11
12. Although the original version of Sec. 1 allowed for no exemptions from its requirements,13 there were many exceptions, including a few more specific exceptions included in Secs. 2-4.14
15. For example, Sec 3 stated that no person ""shall be deprived of Life, Liberty, Property, privileges or immunities,... without Due Process of Law.""16 This was one of several provisions that explicitly addressed the treatment of persons in military hospitals.17
18. Other statutes explicitly granted rights to persons injured in war or in acts of terrorism.19 These include Sec 7 of Title 11, which states that ""no citizen of [the United] States shall, on account of injury received in such service, be discharged from such services.""20
21. Therefore, although our Founders saw the need for limits on government power, they did not set up a one-way street. Rather, there was an evolving set of restrictions that became more restrictive as the Nation evolved.22
22. Consequently, we must ask ourselves: Why did our founders conceive of so many important rights as being limited by the enumeration of particular rights? Why can't we go beyond the bounds of just one or two rights, because they are necessary? What would be our best argument against the inclusion of more rights into the core of constitutionally guaranteed rights if we don't limit the scope of those rights themselves?
23. Our answer is that, while there is no perfect constitutional system, ours is one that contains much more than the bare list of rights presented in our Bill Of Rights, since it contains a vast array of protections for individuals.24
24. Ultimately, therefore, our answer must rest on two propositions: first, that it has been through continual evolution that we have come down to these limits; second, though we may disagree with them today, once we see that they arise from a long history, you cannot oppose them by saying that you think we should have gone another route.25
25. We can agree that there are certain rights that are fundamental, namely those that safeguard the existence of society itself, such as freedom from want.26 However, those are rights derived from necessity.27 When"
You can't hurt me. I'm with the Union. It would be hard for Michiganders to select a single," person over a man who actually committed a crime. The state is a leader in protecting the rights of its citizens.

It's also true that Michie has had some problems with violence. For example, on the evening of July 1, 1994, when two teenagers went to his home and tried to rob him at gunpoint, the two teens were killed. In fact, there was an actual shooting after that, although it did not involve his family. (For example: On April 29, 1996, one woman was killed when she opened fire inside a bar owned by his brother.) And then there is the murder of another man, who was beaten to death on September 27, 1999, because he refused to open a bank account for him. This occurred during the same weekend as the killings of his wife and son. Additionally, in 1998, a black teenager was shot and killed in Ann Arbor, just outside the city limits. Shortly after this incident, investigators found a gun in the boy's car. Not all black males are alike. Many of them have gang connections and a reputation for violence or other crimes.


His brother died before he got his promotion so he wouldn't be able to help him become the chairman of the board. However, he still helped him get the job. More important, though, was that he offered to give his young son the car in exchange for his position. He even gave him $2,000 for that service. His son was only 17 years old at the time. As you can see, his son will never forget what his father did."
"""Safer, Stronger"" … is it? I am George W. Bush, and I approve this message.","

George W Bush has said in no uncertain terms, he will stand up to the terrorists, who we now know are our enemies. The first order of business was the president’s visit to Afghanistan. In a speech there, the U.S. President said ""We will defeat the Taliban and other terrorist organizations and bring peace to this war-torn region.""
And then the President declared: ""Our mission is clear. We are going to bring democracy to Muslim lands.” And he did. And that's what we've done. Now, not all of us agree with the policy, nor does anyone doubt that the mission has succeeded. It's taken a long time. But over a quarter century since September 11, 2001, we have achieved much, though not everything. Our mission accomplished. Not all the way there. A lot of steps left to be taken. That's the only reason why the effort has been such an uphill struggle. This is the kind of thing that usually gets lost in the rush to judgment. Remember, when we were still a nation in waiting, there was no thought of war or any notion of a war on terror. So the government didn't know what it was supposed to do. They had no idea. There was just a lot to figure out. What was happening here? What had to happen for us to accomplish this great mission? And what should they be looking for? They were looking everywhere for something. Where were the leaders? The political leaders were all saying, ""Well, let's start somewhere."" Well, you have to start everywhere, especially when you're trying to end a regime that has killed thousands of people. Put yourself in their shoes. Why would you go anywhere? You don't want to leave your family. You'd rather go and fight. Fight the enemy. Or you could get killed. Did you think you were going outside the wire?
But here we are. Just because you say so doesn't mean you can ignore it. Because once you put the guns down and you begin to look, someone is bound to point the finger at some place. No matter how many times they say, “Oh, that wasn't part of the strategy,“ if you ask them why, they always come back and say oh, yeah, those weren't the orders. Those were later orders, maybe more important than anything else. Yeah, these things are coming together. Everything is moving in this direction. All the pieces are working together in a neat little package. Nothing is happening by accident. Everyone is pushing their buttons. Whatever happens, happens. I hope so. Oh, yes, I do as well. Let me tell you something else about that, too. Whenever I look back, my heart just breaks. Every day is like Christmas, isn't it! I have the same feelings about life. When I went back to America after leaving, everybody was talking about how well things were running there and how quickly things might be changing. Well no, things aren't changing very fast. Things are getting worse. Many of these changes are the result of domestic policies and foreign policies. If you look at what's happening right now in Afghanistan, it's not a domestic issue. Afghan people have been dying for years. Their lives are being threatened by weapons sold to some of their own brothers in arms. More and more people are turning to violence. Afghanistan is a land of blood and destruction. Please remember that. For the past twenty years, Afghanistan was one country. Today, its population is two. Both of which are considered war criminals. (They are). They are killing innocent people every day. Innocent people around them. Almost all Afghans have turned to terrorism. Although the war is starting to slow, violence is increasing. People are becoming more desperate. Attacks are increasing throughout the country, in all parts of society. Afghans need our help. As long as they are fighting us, others will turn to us. Therefore, American citizens, politicians and military personnel must help us fight against terrorism in our homeland. Any form of support is welcome from us and in response, Afghans are asking for you to help them fight terror in your homeland, wherever you live. Your support gives us strength. Help us defeat terrorism and all forms of terror worldwide. God bless you. Thank you.""—US President George Bush speaking at a press conference on September 30, 2004.


It is simply amazing that George Washington never got into a serious gunfight, although he lived to write another phrase. One can only wonder what he would have done if attacked. Certainly, his daughter Martha would not have survived. Neither would John Adams. Nor Thomas Jefferson. Would they have known what they had unleashed? Would their sons be alive today?

"Introduction/Lit Review/Research Design Introduction In my research, I will be attempting to answer"," the following 3 research questions:1. The effect of a long-acting somatostatin analog (octreotide) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who present with recurrent or progressive pancreatitis.2. Whether the addition of octreosintetan is associated with improvement in response rate and survival among patients diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatobiliary malignancy.3. What is the frequency of severe hypoglycemia in octrepitant users? The purpose of this research is to investigate whether octretionate can act as a selective and potent inhibitor of growth of neoplasia, and to understand what it may mean for the future development of treatment regimens aimed at the treatment of these cancers. This project builds upon previous research conducted by myself and others which show that somalostatins are active against a large number of cancers, including pancreata. Sulfated octresotone has shown promise in several preclinical studies in both human pancreati and cell line xenografts models of pancreatica. In order to increase efficacy, we believe that it is critical to modify the formulation of the peptide to be more soluble, with the goal of generating an oral formulation. Our hypothesis is that octrevastatin (a novel formulation, Rovastain®), a somasorbicine analog, will provide better pharmacokinetics, increased bioavailability, improved stability, reduced gastrointestinal toxicity, enhanced therapeutic index, greater potency, longer duration of effects, higher selectivity, lower doses and potentially shorter infusion time. These formulations will have the potential to yield significant benefits in the management of patients on current anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. [unreadable] [parent=""Gut"" id=""GRN0013_0004""] [subset=""all""] The first aim of our study is designed to test the hypothesis that the long acting octrettase receptor agonist, octeretan, can be used to treat patients suffering from pancreatric cancer. We will use the National Cancer Institute trial of lapatinib to assess the effect on overall survival. Additionally, since the only FDA approved somatic therapy for advanced disease is somaltuzumab, the second aim tests whether there is any benefit in terms of overall response rates and progression free survival for patients receiving octrxonate alone. Lastly, once we have established the preliminary efficacy of Octrexate, additional studies are needed to fully establish its use in different indications and in combination with other agents. Therefore, a third aim is proposed to study the mechanism of action of somalsorbsorbytate in tumor cells and tissues. Finally, based on our preliminary results and our experience using the same drug in phase I trials, it appears that our findings will suggest that new approaches to the delivery of therapies that target key proteins involved in regulation of glucose metabolism should be pursued. Studies are being planned to determine the most suitable schedule and route of administration for octrezantin in vivo. A final aim involves assessing the efficacy and safety of combining octrexel with high doses of doxorubicin. It is expected that this combination will synergistically enhance the therapeutic effects of each drug. Given the heterogeneity of adenocarcinoma histologies, numerous patient populations and variable responses to current chemotherapy regiments, understanding the role of alternative forms of therapy could lead to new opportunities for clinical application. Combining different drugs into one therapy is a promising approach to overcome some of those challenges. There is evidence to suggest, however, that sequential administration of two different agents might also have a direct positive effect. If this is indeed the case, then it will allow for assessment of whether the synergy between the two drugs is due to their shared mechanism(s) of interaction or if it arises as secondary effects. Anyhow, when we combine 2 agents that have distinct mechanisms of inhibition of DNA repair enzyme function, namely cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, no obvious synergistic activity is seen. However, even when combined, there was no difference in effectiveness between combinations of cisapride and cycloheximide relative to cisodexmycin and hexamethylmelamine. Based on these results, continued efforts are underway to develop new agents and strategies that not only improve the quality of life for cancer patients but also improve their chances of cure. Ultimately, these studies will help to define the specific roles of different types of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapeutics."
The Electoral Micro-Macroeconomic Cycle: Taking Tufte to the State Level  Introduction Citizens of democratic governments wield a tool by which," they exercise their sovereignty over other citizens. The state is the only place where citizens can vote and elect representatives, who represent their will on issues that pertain to their lives. In the US, for example, each state has an independent commission on voter rights, which oversees the protection of the rights of citizens to vote, run for office, and to access public services. This independent body is called the National Commission on Election Integrity (NCOEI). The NCOEI serves as the ‘gateway’ to state and federal elections, bringing together election integrity experts and election security experts, among other experts. Recent events have underscored the importance of ensuring the integrity of elections in both the states and the federal level. A number of states have passed voter registration and information requirements, with the intent to increase voter turnout and combat voter fraud, including North Carolina, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin, Colorado, Maryland, California, New Hampshire, Vermont, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Utah, Ohio, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, North Dakota, Idaho, Minnesota, Arizona, Oregon, Connecticut, Delaware, Montana, South Dakota and Indiana. Other states are working to pass laws to prevent voter impersonation, such as Illinois and Missouri. Many of these states also have legislation that makes it a felony to cast a ballot twice. Voter suppression is a key tool used by governments to suppress the participation of its citizens, because citizens are often more willing to support policies that serve the interests of their government than those of other people. Consequently, voter suppression laws can sometimes lead to disenfranchisement of some citizens due to fear of being prosecuted. Although the most serious form of voter discrimination is illegal registration, the threat of harassment, intimidation, or arrest can threaten to discourage citizens from participating in politics altogether. Electors of a democratic government are thus subject to many forms of social control, not the least of which is direct government interference with their personal life choices.

A number studies have described the ways in which voters are influenced by governmental influence and manipulation. Studies of public opinion around elections have found that, on average, voters tend to be more influenced than non-voters by public statements made by officials, politicians, political advertisements and campaign ads, as well as by official election news stories about candidates. Not all voters, however, are swayed by these kinds of campaign messages, especially in the beginning stages of an election cycle. When the candidate is first elected, campaigns focus much more on what the public wants, instead of focusing on how their opponent would behave during the campaign. Public attitudes remain strongly influenced throughout the long term, even when candidates are perceived to have a large margin of victory. Throughout the history of American elections there have been numerous efforts to manipulate the way in to voting by the state level, often through aggressive efforts like voter intimidation tactics and attempts to restrict access to public facilities. Some of this happened during early elections prior to 2000, when there was a lot of media coverage of candidates and potential outcomes. However, other campaigns went much deeper into voter manipulation strategies. Prior to 2004, there were some states that tried to encourage voting via various means. For example Alabama and NorthCarolina, both states where voter ID laws were enacted, enacted restrictions on early voting. Additionally, a number states enacted laws that restricted the amount of time that voters could register to go to elections. Finally, some jurisdictions attempted to block voters from voting in certain parts of towns. Such efforts resulted in a disproportionate number African American and Latino registered voters being disenfranchised. More recently, since the 2000 election, several states undertook a series of reforms intended to make voting easier. Most notable among these reforms was the Texas Voter ID law, implemented in 2012, requiring voters to present a government issued photo ID at the polls. Texas also implemented a voter identification requirement in 2014, while other states like Florida and Ohio implemented similar laws. Under these changes, registered individuals could no longer use public transportation, drive to places where polling booths were located, nor could people travel to polling locations without valid identification. These measures aimed to alleviate some of concerns that were associated with early voter registrants, particularly in urban environments. But these initiatives did not stem the tide of widespread voter apathy, partly because they did little to curb voter participation. Ultimately, though, these efforts served to exacerbate the problem of low voter turn out. Voters were still reluctant to participate because of lack of awareness and poor information about the election process. Low voter Turnout: An Old Problem By the 2016 presidential election season, four out of five eligible voters nationwide had not cast their ballots yet. Nearly 80 percent of voters say they are either not sure or do not know whether they will vote for a candidate. Pollsters believe that voter ignorance is one reason for low turnout.

"Literature Review on the Impact of Institutional Reforms on Electoral Corruption Jose V. Abueva, head of the Citizen's Movement for a"," Democratic Republic of Congo and a researcher in constitutional law at UNHRC

Jose Vázquez-Flores, who was an Associate Professor at University of San Carlos in Costa Rica from 2005 to 2014, has published numerous articles in academic journals such as the International Studies Review, American Political Science Review and Journal of Democracy and Social Change. He has also edited a number of books including Electoral corruption in Latin America: An overview (2005), Electoral Imbalance and its Consequences (2008) Electoral Fraud and Electoral Reform (2012) and The Electoral System: Political Accountability in Africa (2014).
In this research paper, we aim to analyze how institutional reforms affected political corruption through its effect on voter registration and electoral participation rates. The first part of this analysis considers changes in voter participation that took place between 2002 and 2013. This analysis aims to assess whether there was a statistically significant change in both voter turnout and voter error rate. In the second part, the analysis examines the effect of reforms on electoral corruption. We use regression models to test the hypothesis that voter control and corruption are associated with a decrease in registration errors and an increase in registered voters. Finally, our analysis explores the extent to which reforms may have improved the efficiency of election administration.
Our findings show that the reform of electoral system in several countries had a positive effect in terms of voter voting behavior, although it does not lead to a significant increase of registered populations. Our results also suggest that reforms can be successful only if their effects are sustained. Therefore, it is important to monitor the impact of these reforms because they should be maintained over time. Additionally, there is a need to conduct more in-depth studies in different countries to detect the factors that influence the outcomes of reform.


Research Question
We analyzed the trends of changes of registration data and election irregularities between 2000 and 2016. Based on these data, four variables were defined:
1. Changes in the registration rate (registration error)
2. Registration rate (%)
3. Voter turnout
4. Electoral irregularities (voter error, voter fraud, and registration fraud).

 Sample
All data used in this study came from the INLA database. INLAS uses aggregated data to track changes before and after a given event. It is one of Brazil's main electoral databases that includes information about votes and voters' registration. Since INAIA is the only source that analyzes elections, INLa has access to comprehensive data about each country's electoral process. Data collected from INla include: 
registrations by voter
changes in population size and number
data about political parties and their supporters
information on polling places and polling locations
date of elections (2000–2016)

 Method
The data were analyzed using regression analyses. More specifically, linear regression was used to investigate the association between the dependent variables, changes per year and changes during the years 2000–2013, with the independent variables: registration error percentage, registration percent, turnout, incidence of anomalies and incidence violations. Regarding the two dependent variable changes, regression analysis was performed considering the period 2000-2010 and 2010-2013. Regression models were built to predict registration numbers, errors, etc. based on changes over the previous years. Both models consisted of a set of explanatory variables that included the same independent variable. As stated above, those regressions were run in three periods: 2000—2002, 2003—2004, 2008—2009. Table 1 shows the input data for each regression. Each regression model consisted 100 observations, 50 observations for the 2000 — 2002 period, 150 observations in 2003 — 2004 and 400 observations 2009 — 2013 period. Due to the small sample size, no statistical inference was made regarding changes since 2002. All regressors were standardized to facilitate interpretation. Thus, a regression equation was computed that estimated the expected value of each dependent and independent quantity. Note that regression equations refer to average values of all independent and dependent categories. For example, for registration number, 3 would be the average value for any given year where the population reached or stayed above or below 300 000. Similarly, 4 would indicate that for every year the number remained constant, while registering error would remain unchanged. Considering these parameters, percentages of change over a specific time period were estimated. Differences among the three groups of years were tested using one-way analysis of variance, which was applied to each independent categorical variable (i.e., 2000, 2001, 2002,..., 2013) in each period of time considered. Statistical analysis showed that there were statistically differences (p < 0.05) between ""decrease"" and ""stable"" regressor group (period 2000 – 2002); ""change"" vs ""non-significant change"" (2003 – 2004); and stable vs non-stabilized (2007 – 2009) for all dependent"
Candidate debates in Vermont ?? Question 1 Part A -1 The Supreme Court has held," that the First Amendment prohibits a government from infringing upon a person's freedom of speech, even when that speech is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. The First Circuit Court of Appeals found that it was unconstitutional to ban political ads that criticize current candidates on the basis of their race. This debate focuses on two of the recent rulings by this court. In its case concerning an individual's rights to speak freely, the court stated: ""We do not take lightly such an intrusion on privacy and our precedent does not permit the government to prevent all discussion of candidates’ views. Our prior precedents have established the limits of free speech.""

Question 2 Part B -2 The court has also held there is no First amendment right to be a ""symbolic spokesman"" of a candidate. Under that holding, candidates could not use campaign ads to communicate with the public that they support their opponent's views without running afoul of campaign finance laws. Both candidates here would be prohibited from discussing issues and ideas with any outside group that does business with a PAC that is not directly affiliated with them. Candidates would only be allowed to talk about policy issues with groups that are directly associated with their campaigns. (See the chart above.)
If you cannot afford to run your own campaign, you can donate money to a third party organization that will help you to raise the funds necessary to compete in the race for your seat.
A few of these third-party organizations are:
The League of Women Voters of Vermont
Vermont Progressive
Legislative Campaign Committee
Club for Growth
Americans for Prosperity
American Unity PAC
L.E.U.S.A.V.H.T.G.R.O.B.D.K.P.C.I.N.M.L.-H
It is estimated that about 5% of all voters in this country are third parties. Many of us believe that this is the most powerful force in our country today. If you think we should have more power, then you have a responsibility to send a message to our elected officials. Please consider supporting your local third Party organization if you live in or near a district where you feel your voice should be heard. Be sure to tell them that YOU want to make your district more prosperous and that you want the district to have the best representation possible. For example: If a voter in your town is upset that their school is failing because they cannot get good teachers to teach the kids, let them know that WE are going to put in lots of teachers and we will work with all of our local school boards and superintendents to ensure that we have excellent teachers. Let them KNOW that I am asking you FOR YOUR VOTE. You may also consider using your tax-free money from your home to support a ballot measure which you believe would improve your community. Every dollar that goes into your hard-earned money is a dollar less that might be used to further your family's health, education and welfare. We need more money in all kinds of ways. More money for schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, water and sewer facilities, clean air and clean water. Just as you are making your fair share of money now, we hope to see more of it in years to come. It is your responsibility as a taxpayer to invest in programs that improve our community and make us a better place to live. Make a difference. Use the resources at your disposal to improve the way things are. Don't let those who try to steal your money win. Vote for candidates that care about your future, not the one who cares only about winning the next election. Remember, each time you vote, give some back.

QUESTION 1
PART A
(A)
Summary of Arguments
¶ 6. Should the state or a political party spend money on advertisements that attack a sitting official's integrity on grounds that he or she is unethical or immoral?
Answer: Yes
Explanation: In response to this question, counsel for the parties argue that there are two competing First Amendments, one for political speech and the other for commercial speech. That being said, both sides recognize that under this analysis, there would remain no constitutional right for a member of Congress to express his or her views on issues of public interest"
"Correspondence Between South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and President Gerald Ford On January 27, 1973 the United States, North Vietnam, South"," Vietnam and China signed an agreement of mutual assistance in defense which provided that the U.S. military would be dispatched into South
Vietnam to help defend against attacks by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units. This was one of a series of agreements that established the framework for the “cold war” as the two nations began their three-sided confrontation over Vietnam. The agreement called for
defense forces to be deployed along the border with North Korea. In addition, the countries also agreed to begin negotiations on ‘freezing’ the communist forces in Vietnam; that is, they would allow the NVA to continue fighting against the government of the South until they had lost all
their manpower and ammunition.
The Nixon administration, which was not involved in negotiations, responded by increasing the size and scope of its air and naval forces and ordering them into combat in support of an effort to retake
South Vietnam from the communists. Nixon‟s decision was based on the assumption that it was only a matter of time before the North could take the cities of Saigon and
Cien Gio to prevent the remaining forces of South Viet Nam from resisting the enemy. Although the initial response of North Korean forces was to launch preemptive attacks on
Saigon, Nixon later determined that any North Koreans who remained in South Vtas would commit suicide rather than fight their way out of their country. Thus, when the first Southvietnamese
troops were ordered to land in 1973, American advisers initially suggested that they should be given air cover from North American B-52 bombers. A subsequent review of
historical sources, however, concluded that this plan was actually a direct attack on North Cambodian troops, who were occupying South Phnom Penh. As a result, in March
1974 Nixon agreed that only helicopters would fly troops into Saigontown, and that, since these forces would not enter North Khorean controlled territory, no North
Korean forces were to fire on UH-60s that would land at Phuoc Tuy Province. Instead, helicopters were tasked with landing in villages where UB-1 heavy
bombers would remain in contact with the helicopters. Both of these requirements were later met. [p. 30]
(b) The Impact of Kissinger„s Decision
Despite the Nixon-ordered changes in strategy, Kissinger decided to seek an independent course of action after being advised by his senior national security advisors
about a plan that President Ronald Reagan had proposed in January 1974. Under this scheme, designated Operation Mongoose, UNAVIRES would send UUMF (United
Nations Military Advisor Group) officers to South Africa to study the potential of nuclear weapons as a deterrent to communist aggression. Shortly thereafter,
President Ford convened the National Security Council (NSCC) for meetings to discuss a range of issues relating to foreign policy. These discussions focused on what
would happen if North and South tried to attack one another. Following this, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger asked for advice from a team of experts that included
former Presidents Gerald F. Ford and Jimmy Carter. Not surprisingly, this group recommended that both South and North initiate hostilities to test the
capabilities of each country to resist a renewed offensive by the other. It was suggested, for example, that North threaten South with military force and then
invade South from without. Based on these recommendations, Trump authorized the deployment of four UU-500 (Boeing HC-130), the same helicopter used by President Nixon, to conduct
phases of Operation
Mongoose in February and March 1975. Subsequently, President Ford granted more funds for Operation M.O.M.G.T. (“Operation Magic Trick Tree‚[a] +‰›‡‹) to
instruct UMM in the planning and execution of this strategy. Finally, on March 7, 1975, upon President Carter‏′s recommendation, he authorized a full invasion of Indochina
and its surrounding waters. Given these developments, it appears that there was little opposition to this policy once it reached the president. Moreover, although
this approach to the war was highly controversial, because of past military failures, such as that in Laos, Vietnam was seen as simply an unnecessary risk. Consequently, even
those critics who opposed the policy acknowledged that having the CIA behind the decision to invade was better than having them completely in control of all aspects of warfare. Whatever
concerns there may have been, those who advocated a greater level of freedom for military commanders in Washington were considered too radical and did not get
the same support as those in Saorokon. By the end of 1975 the prospect of war between the"
"Background of Policy Issue- Human Trafficking in an International Context International organizations have been created to advance trade, peace, and"," development. In some countries, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Turkey, Vietnam, or Malaysia, human rights activists are concerned about human trafficking. The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNICEF, nongovernmental organizations, business people, academics, NGOs, politicians, military officers, scientists, policemen, lawyers, journalists, religious leaders, etc. may share the same concern. This paper will explore the policy issues of trafficking on a global level, with the aim of informing the international community and policy makers. It will focus on human smuggling, specifically, how it relates to trafficking around the world. Human smuggling is defined as ""the clandestine movement of people for commercial purposes"" in all parts of globe, not just in developed countries. Globalization has facilitated the growth of human traffic, especially in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, North America and Europe. Recent statistics show that more than a billion humans are trafficked every year across the globe. Therefore, it is critical to study the trends of these human smuggions in different countries and to assess the risk of their consequences. Finally, this paper seeks to highlight the most important international policies and laws which should be put in place to prevent human traffickin within the existing international order.

Introduction Trafficked human beings are subjected to extreme poverty, degradation, humiliation, violence, death, torture, forced marriages, debt bondage, sex slavery, exploitation, medical malpractice, malnutrition, disease, quarantine, mental illness, poor health care and a host of other human atrocities, which make them suffer and die.1 As they are forced to be trafficker, they lose their self-esteem, independence, hope, dignity, freedom, self determination and agency, even when they encounter a seemingly great success in life.2 Human smugglers are professionals who use violence to obtain the goods, mainly from other people. They are driven by greed and gain profit by trafficking human products, including children and women.3 The most vulnerable are the minors, pregnant women, women and girls, orphans, elderly persons, those whose socio-economic status is low, marginalized persons and those suffering from a serious physical illness or any kind of trauma.4
Worldwide, over 1 billion people are victims of forced prostitution, enslaved, sold into sexual servitude or forced marriage. Many of them are vulnerable and cannot leave their country of origin due to fear of being caught, tortured, imprisoned, killed, exiled, expelled, ostracized, discriminated against, denied access to education, employment, housing, health services, water, food, shelter and other basic human necessities.5 About a million children are internally displaced due either to conflict or to armed conflict.6 More than 25 million people become refugees worldwide because of war, armed insurgency, natural disaster, poverty and political instability.7 These people have to flee their homes, often in a hurry, to seek safety in third countries where they remain in camps for months or years before being resettled in safe places.8
As a result of massive international trade and migration, various illegal practices are associated with this phenomenon. A major cause of this is the increase of irregular migration originating from developing countries to richer countries via the informal trade route, primarily in goods such clothing, textiles, furniture, wood and plastic articles.9 Because of lack of awareness and strict control measures, there are large numbers of traffickers in both directions.10 This form of smuggling has increased in recent years, partly due also to changes in trade routes, economic conditions and internal social and cultural conflicts.11 The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates that 3.95 million persons were trafficsd worldwide in 2014,12 while Amnesty International reports that 1.25 million women were sexually exploited through bonded labor in 2017.13 Human trafficking in the Asia Pacific is a growing phenomenon, particularly in China and Southeast Asia.14 Human traffickers demand for children, young females, prisoners, laborers, old women/men, domestic servants, beggars and soldiers are increasingly becoming a source of revenue for organized criminal gangs.15
International human traffickers are considered the worst form and type of transnational criminal activity.16 Human Traffic in International Law
Human trafficking is one of several crimes against humanity and international law is clear that it can never be allowed to exist.17 It violates the principle of “universal jurisdiction” in international relations,18 which states that a state is bound by its own laws, customs, traditions and common law throughout its territory.19 The notion of universal jurisdiction does not exclude the existence of individual states but rather establishes the limits to which international treaties and customary law can go.20 The principle holds that no state shall"
"Increases in HIV/AIDS Education and Prevention in China Margaret Hamburg writes that, In the case of potential epidemics",", such as AIDS (Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome) in Africa, China is the one country that has had the experience of a full-scale epidemic involving the human immunodeficiency virus. The first cases of AIDS occurred in mainland China in 1981. In 1985, Beijing introduced voluntary HIV testing for blood donations and the number of people infected with the virus increased by 1000% from 10,000 to 150, 000, and this process led to the successful eradication of the disease within 2-3 years.[1][2] This is an important achievement for any country who is trying to control the epidemic. [3] It is estimated that only about 14% of eligible donors are tested for HIV, although this percentage is increasing.

The Chinese government started to increase HIV education and prevention efforts in 1991. China has joined UN agencies, medical organizations and international health organizations in providing support and information to prevent the spread of HIV and to manage the ongoing AIDS epidemic.[4] In 1999, the Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed an agreement with WHO to start the China-HIV/ AIDS initiative, which was set up to educate more than 100 million people on the risk of contracting HIV. This initiative has grown to meet the demands of both governments and organizations. More than 1,800 organizations from over 30 countries are working towards the same goal through the Beijing-Harvard agreement, making the initiative a worldwide effort. Since 1992, nearly 160, 300 people have died due to HIV infection in all parts of China, with most deaths occurring among the lower classes. These figures are considered to be a national disaster. By 2006, 70% or more of new infections had occurred among those under thirty years of age.[5] According to Chinese officials, 40% to 60%of infected individuals were living in rural areas.[6]
It is clear that HIV is a serious problem in Asia and that it will take decades before the death toll reaches the level of large- scale mortality in the developed countries of Europe. Recent data show that the prevalence of acquired immunological deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the cause of which is undiagnosed HIV infections, has increased dramatically in many Asian countries, especially in Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal and China. Between January 2001 and June 2007, there were 973, 678 and 557 new cases in Hanoi, Jakarta and Manila respectively.[7] The cumulative number is at least 8,200 and could reach around 50,600 by 2015.[8] There are still many people who are unaware of their HIV status, but they are waiting for the right moment to test. A lack of awareness has contributed to a high rate of infection rates in several Asian nations. With the increase of cases, additional funding is needed to deal with this problem. Other health problems caused by AIDS are the increased incidence of cancers such hepatitis C, tuberculosis, hemophilia and drug resistance.[9] Some estimates have shown that more women in East Asia will get HIV by the year 2010.[10] Currently, about 20% - 30% can develop AIDS and die from the complications of this disease.[11] Although AIDS is now a rare occurrence in most of East Asian populations, it has persisted in certain areas. For example, some groups of Asians, who have the longest history of exposure to AIDS, have a much higher risk for developing the AIDS. Asians who reside in urban centers, for example Tokyo and Beijing, are particularly at risk. Many of these regions are suffering severe economic depression, poverty and unemployment, partly due the HIV epidemic in these places. Consequently, they need special efforts to encourage the population to adopt better public health measures. However, in recent years, a few Asian cities have experienced a dramatic decrease in AIDS cases. Although the statistics vary from place to place, HIV has been successfully eliminated in Japan and Korea. Singapore is also believed to have achieved its goal and is moving towards eradicating AIDS.[12] Because of its low income status and easy accessibility, Hong Kong, Macao, southern China and Taiwan are also experiencing a drastic decrease of patients. Therefore, establishing good public awareness and healthy attitudes towards HIV will help in stemming the growth of diseases caused from HIV,[13] especially since they share the characteristics of low social development and poor health conditions.[14] Furthermore, because of an increase in Internet access, various researchers have tried to discover other possible factors that influence HIV transmission. Previous studies have suggested that high-risk behaviors, including unprotected sex, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and unsafe abortion, were involved in spreading HIV.[15] Others have focused on behavioral factors, like late sexual activity or risky behaviors. Recently, studies on gender difference have yielded inconsistent results. Based on a meta-analysis, researchers in France, Spain, Australia and Brazil"

This approach has contributed to state repression and violence through its use of violent suppression, abduction, imprisonment, assassination, harassment, torture, rape, forced recruitment into various paramilitary groups and organized criminal activity, which has resulted in a large number of ‘disappeared‟ and disappeared. In fact, since 1994 there have been approximately 5,000 cases of people missing from the country, with many more suspected or convicted. The government of Nicaragua has systematically violated human right laws, policies, laws and procedures, including the laws on human trafficking and forced labor, immigration, asylum, quarantine, repatriation, temporary resident, family reunion, detention, prohibition of certain foods and beverages, export of goods, confiscation of commodities, customs, sanctions, prohibitions, expropriation and abrogation measures, restrictions, closure of ports and airports, blockade and harassment of shipping, seizures, banning of ships, closing of land routes, closed ports, partial and total blockade of agricultural products, denial of permits for foreign vessels entering the sea, exclusion of imported foreign products from ports of entry, restriction of movement of persons and goods within and out of the territory of Nicaraguan government, prosecution of officials, politicians and political leaders, disappearance of individuals and institutions, prison, tortures, disappearances, abductions, arrests, detentions and imprisonment. Under this regime of oppression and repression some 80% of all people in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) – World Population Fund report of 1993 – speak out, write, protest, challenge the state, condemn and denounce these violations and crimes against human beings. Many other people also speak up and make demands. For example, when President Ortega was removed from power in 1998, hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans wrote letters to their presidents, parliamentarians, mayors, senators, congressmen, UNDP representatives, NGOs, embassies, ambassadors, congressional representative, members of regional commissions, nongovernmental organizations, civil society organizations and journalists, demanding his reinstallation. More than 100,00 signed petitions calling for his reestablishment by the National Human Rights Council. Some of these letters were collected and assembled by Dr. Ricardo Reyes, who published an article in El Universal, June 25, 1999, entitled: Nicaragua‚Äôs People Speak Out, Praising the Revolution and Calling for Reinstatement of President Omar Torrijos, in which he cites a speech of a signatory of this petition, Joaquin Castillo. These include the following: „This is the most powerful statement that I have heard in my life about the government.

"Implications of Georgian NATO membership for the South Caucasus In a speech made in November 2005, NATO Secretary General"," Wesley Clark called for NATO to expand its mandate beyond its original mandate of training local forces and advising on deterrence. In particular, Clark stated that the NATO intervention in Afghanistan had created ""a world order in which regional threats are increasingly global, and our ability to meet them is increasingly dependent on the willingness of others to help us."" After the war in Iraq was over, however, the United States and its allies were confronted by a range of problems that were far from being resolved. The problems, in particular the continuing presence of Islamic militants in the region, have prompted a reconsideration of some of the assumptions that undergird the existing alliance. This paper provides an overview of these developments, with the specific aim of showing how NATO's membership of Georgia has implications for South Asian politics. Central to this discussion is the question of whether Georgia's engagement in military conflict with Russia makes Georgia a member of NATO or a potential target of Russian military actions. Although the two states are not in direct conflict, their strategic relations offer a window through which Georgia can shape the regional balance of power in its favour. Finally, this analysis draws conclusions about the strategic and political landscape of South Asia that would be relevant to any future conflicts between Georgia and other members of its NATO family.

Introduction In November 2003, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld delivered a televised address to Congress, announcing that NATO was preparing for “the most serious and complex military crisis since World War II” in response to emerging threats in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Persian Gulf.1 The Washington Post carried a news headline on 16 December 2003: NATO Wields Power Against Terrorism.2 Since the U.S. presidential election of 2004, politicians and pundits alike have repeatedly discussed the prospect of a ‘new cold war’ among the great powers of Eurasia.3 The New Cold War is one of several terms used to refer to the escalating tensions between the West and Russia, mainly in Eastern Europe.4 This increasing antagonism between Russia and all the major powers in Eurasian regions—namely, China, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia—has recently begun to crystallize into a geopolitical reality.5 But unlike the ’old cold wars, no one knows exactly what the new cold will be like, nor when it will end. For example, although it has long been widely assumed that Russia would quickly withdraw from Afghanistan once NATO forces were withdrawn,6 the Russian president Vladimir Putin seems to have convinced himself that Moscow would not abandon Afghanistan as soon as the fighting ended.7 But the situation in Central Asia and in neighboring countries such as Pakistan presents a far greater challenge than Afghanistan does, especially in terms of security.8 In fact, Central Asian states also seem to be far less amenable to Moscow's influence than are the states of Europe and North America.9 A number of Central Asians, such15 as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan,14 have declared their intention to engage in armed conflict if Moscow does not withdraw.10 This raises the issue of how CentralAsia could be a key location where Russian-Uzbekistani tensions could continue to escalate. Given that CentralAsians have historically supported strong NATO ties with Germany,11 there is little reason to expect that they would support a similar association with Moscow. But more important than the likelihood of an escalation of tensions in any one country is that any escalation must occur in accordance with CentralAsian interests. That is, Moscow can make no commitment to Centralasians while they are fighting with each other, or if they decide to withdraw militarily. To avoid this, Russia should seek to avoid the kind of escalatory conflict that Western powers have experienced in Latin America in recent years.12 In the absence of such conflict—which may take place anywhere in Asia—Moscow should instead seek a peaceful settlement to its relations with central Asia. Under this scenario, Athens would represent the most significant obstacle to Russian ambitions in central Eurasii,13 and Moscow might be able to convince central Asian leaders to accede to NATO and to agree to mutual defense arrangements.15 Thus, if Centralasia were to fall out of play, we might expect a rapid increase in Russian attempts to undermine NATO commitments,16 and a gradual loosening of diplomatic, economic, financial and cultural constraints.17 It is therefore crucial that we understand the potential implications of European membership in NATO for Central Eurasoi policy towards Moscow and for any possible Russian actions in this regard. Throughout this chapter, I discuss a number different aspects of this relationship, including those related to Russia's relations toward Central American countries,18 Central Asiatic countries and Afghanistan.19 The historical context surrounding these questions is important for understanding the present state of affairs in all these regions. Therefore, it is only fair"
Political Realignment in the South A nation as large and diverse as America must certainly," find itself in such an interesting place. In recent years, African American leadership has shifted away from a black separatist perspective on issues like race, class, and education to a “civil rights” approach to political change. This new generation of black leaders, who are making the kind of bold decisions and radical moves that would be unthinkable for the previous generations, is increasingly coming to understand that it may be time to put the past behind them and work for a society that represents all people. The political reality of today is that social and political structures are being challenged not just by a historic increase in white supremacy and racism, but also by new forms of oppression and inequities that include not only racism but sexism, ableism, colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, xenophobia, Islamophobia and a host of other forms—many of which are embedded in wider patterns of social, economic, political and cultural power.

A new, innovative black leadership that recognizes the centrality of a new kind or ‘political realignment’ is showing us that its time is now. A movement that has struggled to break free from its legacy of race-baiters and right-wing ideologues is taking seriously the concerns of people of color, especially those whose voices are marginalized in terms of wealth, education, housing, jobs, health care and many other aspects of their lives. Black women in particular have seen their voices silenced, marginalized and silenced in so many ways that they can only speak out with more courage and passion. Many of us are becoming more aware of the ways in which our lives, communities, neighborhoods and cities are defined and reshaped by race and class. More than ever, we are waking up to the reality that structural oppression is happening at the core of so much of our daily lives and that our movements need to be developed from the bottom-up to overcome this systemic problem. Our leaders are realizing that through conscious effort and creative solutions, they too can bring about a form of ’political transformation‘ that could lead to real changes in both the way our world operates and in how we live together. It seems that every year more black people around the world begin to question whether we should be looking outward rather than inwardly to figure out how to move forward collectively and truly make things better. We are entering a crucial time in our country where we see a return to true black pride and unity, not a retreat from our blackness into some kind if meaningless version of identity politics. Not only is the black community growing in numbers, it is also growing across the political spectrum, from those who have historically been on the left to those on either end of ideological and partisan lines. As this political realignment takes shape, questions will no longer be asked why we fight so hard for what we want. Instead, the new black leader will demand that we start thinking about what it means to live and act with integrity and courage, instead of just using our bodies and our minds to satisfy a political system that uses us and uses our children as cannon fodder. They will seek to inspire us to dream big, to demand justice, equality and respect. While black Americans have been doing this work in various ways for quite some time, few have had the chance to fully understand what is at stake until now because the conditions that gave rise to this moment have not yet come to light. But as the momentum of these new leaders builds, others will begin asking the same questions and beginning to imagine what the future of this country could look like if we woke up and decided to act on what really matters to us. What will happen to our communities if elected leaders cannot be held accountable to their constituents and to each other, if they are unable to rein in racist and sexist behavior, or if their leaders refuse to recognize the structural power of those in power? What sort of society do we really want to build when we don‟t even realize what needs to change?
No one wants a country that‚Äôs controlled by whites,‖"" said Richard Childs, president of Fair Housing Council. ""There is a great deal of good that can come out of having a diverse population, ethnic populations, races, genders, abilities, backgrounds.""
It is vital that any discussion about integration focuses on equity, said childs. He continued, ""If you focus on quotas, you're still going to have a lot of problems, because there is never enough seats. There is something about racial balance that makes it easier to attract minorities.‬‹""
But this is only the beginning of an even bigger struggle for justice in America, cautioned Michelle Alexander, author of In These Times. She pointed out that, since the election of Obama, there have already been 10 new bills introduced in Congress, three more have gained the support of at least two senators, 30 House bills"
"China's Evolving Role in Peacekeeping On August 31st 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed"," Resolution 1655 in response to the war in Afghanistan. The Resolution called upon all States to immediately join a NATO and UN mission to train and equip Afghan forces and to increase their capability of combat in order to prevent Afghanistan from going over to terrorism. This was a necessary step, especially since the Security council could not get anything else done at that time.

A few days later, on September 2nd 2006 China's Defense Ministry ordered the PLA to send a full contingent of more than three hundred thousand soldiers to Afghanistan to support the NATO mission. China had no specific mission statement for this mission, but it seemed that it would be a show of support for the international coalition. Many of the soldiers would enter the combat zone directly, and there was no expectation that they would remain in the country beyond that. In fact, once the mission ended, they were supposed to withdraw back to their home base before the end of October. What also became clear is that the Chinese were much less enthusiastic about what they had to do. When the troops arrived in Kabul, most of them were already either training, preparing for duty or just getting used to life in an unfamiliar country. They had little or no training in military matters, let alone conflict resolution. As a consequence, many Chinese soldiers left without knowing how they should behave or what their roles were going to be. Some of these Chinese troops might have stayed in Pekin long enough to become familiar with the ways of their new surroundings, others might never have been assigned to a specific combat unit at all. Others were not so lucky and were still stuck in limbo. There was very little the Japanese or Americans could do for these troops. For example, when a large group of some 300 Chinese students at Beijing's National University of Defense Science and Technology marched through Tiananmen Square on October 4th 2006 and read the names of those killed in China-occupied Tibet, no one took responsibility for what had happened. Not one Japanese nor American official has commented on what happened during the march. Everyone was too busy trying to figure out how to deal with this disaster. Both sides agreed that more troops will be sent to Kabul soon. It is highly doubtful that any of this will ever amount to anything. After all, it is not like we are going anywhere anytime soon anyway. Although China is sending troops, there is no indication that its goal is anything other than to help the peacekeeping mission along. But who knows? The possibility that China might decide to pull out of Afghanistan altogether does not add up to much. If China decides that this is the best it can do, then it will go ahead and send its troops anyway, because it has no choice. Therefore, China cannot blame Japan or the Americans for failing to meet the expectations of its own nation. Nor can it blame them for not being able to accomplish their missions. Whatever China does, though, does nothing for peace in Asia.


It is clear that, for China, Afghanistan represents a lot more work than it seems. More importantly, although it may seem like the U.S., Canada and European nations are the ones that are being asked to take the brunt of whatever happens, those nations really have very few good reasons to start a war. Afghanistan is extremely unstable. Having a country with such an immense drug problem as the one in which we find ourselves is hardly a recipe for success. Certainly, having an aggressive government that goes after whoever it wants is a bad idea. Quite simply, we have no good candidates for occupying Afghanistan and, quite frankly, nobody else is qualified to run the government of a land that is constantly changing hands. (See this article from The New York Times for more details)
1.2. Iran
Iran is one of several countries that have considered the prospect of war with China. Other than a few brief, friendly exchanges between the two leaders in 1998, serious diplomatic discussions have not taken place between them since then. Between 2003 and 2006 Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told a joint conference of Iranian media that he wanted to avoid conflict with his neighbors and that Iran would not join any war against China or any other nation in Central Asia—even if it meant taking part in such a conflict. He stressed that ""Iranian interests"" did not necessarily mean China and other countries, such as Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, that were considered ""imperialists"" by Iran's neighbors. Iranians have also felt that Chinese interests are different from those of other nations. While the majority of Iranians see themselves as part of an ""Islamic identity"" that spans from North Africa to Southeast Asia, Chinese officials view China as a powerful ""hegemon.""
The first real crisis in relations between Iran and China began in 1979 when Iran took a hostile stance toward the People's Republic of China after a series of terrorist attacks on Iranian shipping and aircraft. However"

... /////
A friend on facebook asked what I thought the most surprising thing about Obama's election was. Well that's easy, because he is the president of the U.S., and we all know the answer to that question, yes, surprise!
But what's really surprising is that I think he's the only one who knows exactly what he intends to do. I've seen some of his speeches over the last few years, and this is one where I can see the President of an actual country putting forth a vision for his country. In fact, he believes in that vision, no question.
This is a man who has said he will take the fight to ISIS. This is indeed a bold and daring move, but he also knows that ISIS cannot be defeated unless the government of Syria is allowed to reenter the war-fighting equation, so he takes this action with the knowledge that it will accomplish two things, one, kill ISIS and two, give Obama a nice little victory when it comes to taking credit for ISIS's fall. He knows he took a lot of risk in taking this step, which is why he'll need to be given a good explanation for why this happened. Just as a note: I don't like the way this went down, especially with his own party being responsible for giving him this opportunity, you could argue he was looking for a little fun, instead of a direct military confrontation with ISIS, although it does seem odd to me that he would be taking such drastic steps at this point in time. But hey, if it worked, maybe he wouldn’t have to go back to being president. Anyway, let me know what you think of this, my friends. And if you're reading this right now, thank you for reading it! I'm posting this on FB so I hope you'll read it and link up to my posts. Also, feel free to tell people to check out my blog if they want to know more about what it‘s like to watch me write. Thanks again for your support! You guys rock! Sincerely, (I mean that sincerely). I get lots of support on this blog! #welfarekings

The President Of America?
It's shocking how quickly things can change in just a few months. A few days after the election, Obama made the decision to launch airstrikes on the Syrian rebels. Not just airstrikes, though, these airstrikes were against areas that were being used as frontlines for the ongoing civil war in Syria. Remember, Assad is trying to retake all of eastern Syria from rebels, including those in Deir ez-Zor city, the main cities in Idlib province, who are fighting the Assad regime. Obama knew that the rebel groups in those areas had the potential to cause a serious amount of damage to the already damaged Syrian economy if the rebels were successful, since they had no viable government troops to rely on to help defend them. So even though Obama was concerned about civilian casualties, having the airstrikes focused on rebel forces would likely cause more civilian deaths than the previous attacks by his administration. Additionally, it seemed that Obama felt it important to get Assad out of power, even if this meant that Assad would remain in power. That seems to indicate a similar mindset as the ones surrounding ISIS' rise to power in 2014, with Assad being seen as weak and ineffective, while ISIS is seen to have the capabilities to take power easily. Personally, I believe that both these events are linked to each other, as they both involved Obama wanting to topple the governments of several countries, namely Iraq and Syria, whose leaders refused to surrender their sovereignty to America. More on that later, actually. Oh, before I go, there was one other thing I should mention, something that wasn't discussed in any of Obama‟s media appearances, much less the speeches he gave over those months, until now. Prior to this election cycle, Clinton was being criticized by some Democrats for her support of Obamacare, suggesting she was making the wrong decisions. Yeah, okay, lets run through the history of Clinton vs. Obamatrade:
1) Oba was running for president against Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton wrote a book and gave a speech, called “My Life, Inc.”, criticizing Obama, saying that our country was on a „mission‽. 2) Clinton continued her criticism of Obamanomics after leaving office. She wrote books criticizing"
Ethics in International Development Whether it's Bono organizing a concert for AIDS relief or," Bill Gates funding the fight against polio or Pope John Paul II visiting Africa to spread the Gospel, the efforts of some of the most powerful people in world history have touched the lives of people around the globe. In fact, each and every one of these events has had profound influence on the way the world works, sees itself, thinks about itself and changes the trajectory of its own history. The importance of their personal connections to these very remarkable events cannot be overstated. Yet, because of a fundamental difference in the approach to power, they are all seen by some as different kinds of “power,” even when they share many similarities.

With regard to the first two events, for example, Bill and Ted’s visit to Africa in 1986 is seen as a heroic example of altruism—which it was at times. However, when this visit was compared with the ‘greatest power‘ of all, namely, Napoleon, who was given a similar hero-status that was based on his position of strength and authority, those who actually went to war against him were portrayed as having been manipulated by him. This view persisted, even after the war was won and Napoleon was arrested. And although it may not have been the intention of everyone involved in these two examples, it has been taken as evidence of an attitude towards ’power‖ especially in terms of benevolence, that is, extending the generosity of one‟s own power to others. It should be noted, though, there was much more to their visits than this. Many people knew about the poverty, suffering and racism in Africa, and were moved by it. But such concerns are not the same thing as being moved into action. Although the two were meant to be humanitarian gestures, nonetheless, many of those involved thought they had no choice but to let a man like Napoleon take the credit for the abolition of slavery, something he had done only because he was emperor. To quote Dr John McLeod from an article written in 2012: „If you look back at the history of imperialism, you find that it has gone through many forms, but never in quite this way.“ [emphasis added]
But the effect of this is that the image of power in global relations is constantly changing. Therefore, we should ask ourselves why, if it is indeed true that power is the kind of thing that affects the life of others, does it then seem so essential that any power must also be capable of being manipulated? And what is it that makes power so precious that, once acquired, can never be relinquished?
The need to know the answers to such questions has led us to a historical discussion on power and its nature. We need, therefore, to re-examine the core of our understanding of what it means to say that ‚power is a kind word‛, since it will no doubt be necessary to move beyond this, in order to understand what ‗power represents— and why it can be used in so many ways. Before going further, let me offer my own perspective on what I believe to constitute power. I would like to start by saying that I do not intend to represent any political faction or any ideology, nor am I interested in analysing which method is best to use in achieving the goal of ensuring power distribution. Instead, my aim here is to raise the question of whether power really is something that can change, or if perhaps there is another way of thinking about power that will help us reach a clearer understanding. Having said that however, I shall proceed with this line of thought. More precisely, using what has appeared to me as the ancient Greek philosophical principle of animos, ‹life force›, which I have translated as ‌power (′pwr‴), I try to point out that our main starting point in this discussion is simply to recognise the existence of certain kinds or forms of life-force, such as heat or life itself. These are the forms that give us form, shape, individuality, beauty, purpose and, ultimately, life. As soon as we recognise this we can begin to think about what else we might want to call ‡power. Given this recognition, then, how do we define it? What does  power represent‎ mean? Is it a form of energy or a process or just an idea or feeling? Indeed, what are we trying to accomplish here, other than making the concept of social power better known and understood? My hope is thus that this will lead us deeper into a renewed sense of self-understanding and a greater appreciation of how important it truly is for individuals and groups to act responsibly towards others with whom they have some kind or degree of inter-personal relations.

The word has acquired a variety of connotations—Jewish, Jew-hatred, Jewish blood, Hebrew, or Jewish. Although the term “Jew” itself is somewhat vague, it has an important meaning in its usage in modern Jewish practice, which includes a person practicing Judaism at some point in time. This practice is typically called ‘mizrachim’ (“Jews„), and may include those who have converted to Judaism, those whose faith is only religious or has undergone a radical change over the years, and those being raised Jewish in a nontestamentary way.

Seeking Hope at Home Extensive research has documented how neighborhood conditions affect life outcomes.," This research, often referred to as the “hope-basis” approach, involves measuring the quality of life for a community and then examining the factors that influence this outcome. The hope-based approach is the most successful method because it is based on empirical data and can be tested empirically. In order to test the hope theory, however, researchers typically need to conduct a large number of tests. Large-scale studies are difficult to accomplish. For example, although it has been estimated that about ten thousand tests are performed annually in the U.S., only about five thousand of these tests will yield significant findings. Additionally, such large- scale studies usually involve a disproportionate amount of subjects, with the majority of people participating being minorities. Finally, even when there are positive findings, no study has yet provided sufficient information to support the theory.
A need exists for methods and systems that provide adequate resources to increase the likelihood that individuals will seek help for their health problems."

A few months ago a little-known developer in Australia released the first game of its kind, Tribute to Starcraft, an innovative hybrid of classic competitive strategy with modern day tactics and tactics from today. In its early years the project was met with criticism from a number of people in both the community and in the mainstream press, primarily because of the way it handled player roles and performance. Many of these criticisms pointed out that it made players ""seem less than"" in comparison to their real-world counterparts, and that its ""superhero"" elements had the potential to undermine the integrity of competitive games. Although the developer disagreed with the claims, they believed strongly in its vision and decided to continue with it.Tribute To Starcraft was released on Steam Early Access in February, 2013. Shortly after its release the game's progress was constantly under fire from critics and users alike, mainly due to many questionable decisions made by its designer, Steve ""Sjak"" Larimer. Despite these controversies, Sjako has continued his work on TTS to this day and has produced some amazing content, such as the recent release of Tilt, a free to download version of his game, that has quickly turned into a hit amongst all fans.As part of this ongoing development of SJKL Games we've decided that we'd like our own forum, specifically dedicated solely to discussing and analyzing Valve's franchises (and other titles that they license), as opposed to simply talking about what they've done. Therefore, we're beginning a series of articles devoted to each and every major Valve franchise and why we think they deserve to get the respect they need.The first article in this series is going to focus on one of Valve's biggest franchises: Counter Strike: Global Offensive. After a long history of success with CS:GO, Valve decided a change was in order, something different, unique, special, exciting, challenging. They tried their hand at a completely new genre and did not disappoint. However, when Valve heard that their first entry in that genre, Team Fortress 2, was being planned, no one was more surprised than us. Not only did it become the most downloaded game on Google Play in just one year, it was also the only game that won over a million dollars on RPS, E3 and GDC, plus it beat all of Steam’s big sellers. All of that, yes, not to mention a lifetime of exposure on IGN and Game Informer.We've heard many arguments against Team Fortnite, including that the gameplay mechanics are too similar to CS Go's and the matchmaking system is extremely limited. Other people have stated that Teamforte's main appeal is that players are able to choose who they want to join their teams and there are no limits to who can be a member of your team. Our opinion is simple: If you're going for TeamForte, you go for it! The gameplay itself is great and you can pick from over 15 different teams to build your own squad. You can make your teams anything from 3 members to as large as 100,000 players. Teams can also be built online or on LAN, with only 10-16 teams being available at any given time. Finally, though, if you truly want a team-building game with depth and customization, then you absolutely have to check out FortZen and then FortNite. Both have a lot to offer and come with tons of options, ranging from league-build mode, leader boards, global leaderboards, customizable skins, custom and team difficulty levels, clan rewards, etc. If that's not enough, each has over 150+ cosmetic items that give you unique effects, which adds even more depth to your gameplay.To review, now that you've seen how much great content and excitement the Fortnnite series provides, let's see what's in store for us next. Next, will be the third and final article, focusing on Teamfight, as that game really stands out"
Education Policy and Economic Development A case study of Singapore and an analysis of its applicability to the United States INTRODUCTION The key to sustainable growth in the global economy," is to increase the productivity of workers. This increases the amount of wealth produced by labor and contributes to economic growth. The main driver of productivity growth is the use of scientific advances, such as the increased use and availability of technology. In order to produce more goods and services, companies must invest more money into research and development (R&D). As R& D results are applied to products and devices, they have the potential to be used again and again for years to come. Research and Development spending has increased dramatically over the past few decades, with the most significant investment being in semiconductors. Semiconducting devices make it possible to create a large number of devices at a low cost. Advances in electronics have made the manufacturing process cheaper and easier. Consequently, semiconductor manufacturing has become one of the fastest growing segments of industries. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the semicondutors market grew at an annual rate of 7 percent between 2000 and 2006. Since 1980, this segment of industry has grown at 10 percent annually, and it is expected to continue to grow at double digit rates during the coming decade. More than 80 percent of semiconda

tors are expected worldwide. Based on the recent launch of a new generation of computer chips, computers have become more powerful and efficient. However, no single company controls the vast majority of these developments. Many of today s top tech companies are small and independent companies that only focus on one area or another. Therefore, when investing in technology, small-scale companies can benefit from a diversified portfolio of companies within a larger company. Small- scale companies may be able to obtain the same technology through purchases from larger, well-capitalized companies. Although the prices of some technologies are still very low, other technologies may offer better yields and higher returns. For example, because of their small size, microelectronics companies tend to develop much faster than their larger counterparts, often using production methods and tools that are easily replicated by smaller companies.[1] Due to their ability to meet the needs of consumers and businesses quickly, especially in emerging markets, chip manufacturing companies account for a disproportionate share of innovation. Microchip manufacturing, therefore, offers an excellent opportunity for small companies to enter the market and gain an advantage in price and yield. To compete for these markets and to position themselves to attract new customers, it will be necessary to raise the bar considerably. Both government policies and business competition need to overcome hurdles that small manufacturers may encounter. Singapore's economy has had the longest economic history in Asia and currently ranks fifth globally. It has an aging population and a relatively small population relative to its size. Because of this, Singapore is highly vulnerable to changes in its external environment and its ability of adapting to those changes. Any change in environmental factors would affect the quality of life for Singaporean citizens. Other than a few cases of natural disasters, there have not been many disruptions to Singapore s economic output. [2] One of them has been the long-term decline in Singapores GDP due to slow economic expansion. Between 1990 and 2000, per capita GDP declined from US$8,000 to US $4,600, according to World Bank data.[3] This decline was largely due the slow pace of growth during this period. Furthermore, since the 2000s, economic activity in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, Vietnam, Japan, Australia and other countries have experienced slower economic expansions. Growth in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia has slowed. Rapid economic development is one reason for the declining per Capita GDP in several countries, but it does not explain why the Gini coefficient of national income inequality has gone down significantly. Previous research has suggested that the level of economic inequality in developed countries has decreased over time. Findings showed that, for example: In the early 1970s inequality was at levels lower than now, although it continued to fall slowly. By the end of 1976, inequality had fallen to levels comparable to 1950s levels and then began to rise again.[4] In Europe, studies show that inequality fell slightly between 1991 and 2007, though it has remained relatively constant in Latin America and Asia.[5] Some economists have suggested causes for this decline include changes to demographics, reduced government interference with private enterprise, deregulation and increased globalization. Changes in demographics suggest that people living longer and having fewer children may have more disposable income. Lower government intervention in private business also points to a greater ability for corporations to invest in research, product development and"
The Jewish Vote: An Investigation of the Proposed Rise in 'Chosen' Republicans Introduction Although the United States has constitutional barriers separating the," state governments from each other, the majority of states have chosen to continue to maintain that separation. This is especially true of our nation’s state legislatures, where a large number of “chosen” legislators serve as the representatives of their respective states. The rise of these legislators has had some impact on the quality of life for American Jews, who tend to be disproportionately drawn to the Democratic Party. In order to investigate this phenomenon, I have studied the history of Jewish representation in state legislature. While I was able to obtain data about the composition of state legislators during the years 1894 through 2000, my analysis concentrated on only those states that changed between the two periods. Prior studies focused on changes in voter registration and political affiliation (e.g., Kahan 1992), while I used census data to analyze changes among voters and party affiliation. Although there was no obvious trend in the number or proportion of Democrats who became registered Democrats, there appeared to have been a strong shift among Democrats to support the Republican party. Therefore, when I examined the effect of redistricting by state in 2000 and 2004, which were the only two years for which data was available, it appears that the increase in Jewish elected representatives has been due mainly to Jewish voters changing their party allegiance. Due to this increasing trend, over the last half century, Jewish voter turnout increased, from a mere 13 percent in 1946 to around 30 percent today. Since 2000 the Jewish electorate has increased further to approximately 50 percent, with the most dramatic growth occurring in 2012, nearly doubling the previous turnout. Thus, although Jewish voting behavior is changing, overall Jewish participation in US elections remains at a relatively constant level, suggesting that our democracy has retained its integrity. A similar trend exists in other democracies. Other researchers have shown that voter participation among Jews is increasing more rapidly than any other racial or ethnic group in several countries, such as Germany (Klemperer 1999) and Spain (Shafir 2003). The increase also occurred among the younger generation in France, Italy, and Turkey (O'Reilly 1998). For example, O'Rourke (2002) reports that in Australia, an ""increasing number"" of people of European descent are turning out to vote. Finally, scholars such Timmerman (2000) argue that Jewish identification has grown significantly in recent years in Britain, France and Israel. Given these results, one might assume that Jews would be less motivated to run for office than other groups. However, in spite of this trend towards increased voter activity, a survey conducted by The Pew Research Center (2011) reveals that only 22 percent of respondents under the age of 30 believe that either they should or will vote for a member of Congress. Among those aged 30-64, slightly fewer than half say they will do so, but the figure is actually higher among those under 30. Additionally, about 40 percent say that they know enough members of congress to write them a ballot paper, indicating that even fewer Jews still participate in election campaigns. On the other hand, pollster Stanley Greenberg says that ""Jews are the fastest growing demographic in America."" He explains that just 5 percent polled in 1981, 15 percent within the past few years, 29 percent since 1985, 49 percent before the Civil War, 83 percent between 1850 and 1910, 94 percent prior to World War I, 96 percent after 1945, 118 percent during WWII, 134 percent right after the Second World war, 148 percent currently, 150 percent at the beginning of 2001 and 168 percent now. Greenberg's comment refers specifically to Jews. Pollsters often use statistical tests to test the validity of a claim about a population being larger or smaller. For instance, if you tell a pollsters that 90 percent or 95 percent rate a specific group as politically ""strong,"" then you can expect a high approval rating for that group if it has a larger share of strong respondents. So, for example if a community is rated ""weak,"" it could be inferred that it is politically weaker. Another common example is that if an individual claims to represent the group and uses his or her personal experience to express his/her opinion, then it can be assumed that that individual has genuine knowledge about that particular group. By using statistical measures such confidence intervals, we can estimate how much of an increase or decrease in a sample size is attributable to true variation. As can easily be seen, Jews have a higher approval percentage than all other demographics. Furthermore, polls suggest that a greater proportion approve of Jews than of black Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and American Indians, likely indicating a sense of solidarity with Jews that is not found among other minority groups (Pew Research 2014). Even though Jewish endorsement is higher than for other minorities, Black and Asian populations have lower endorsement rates than whites (Ayers 2016). This suggests that perhaps the ""Jewish Vote"" is somewhat more homogenous than"
America's Undercover Racism Almost 250 years of slavery and another 100 years of," genocide

“In 1792, a black slave named Anthony Benezet became the first person to be hanged in America for a crime he did not commit. The hanging was one of the most notorious of its time. In fact, the execution of black men in chains became so common that it was known as the ‘Hanging Tombs' of Philadelphia.” -New York Times, June 6, 2013
(http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/politics/in-1792-a-black-slave-named-anthony-benezets-became-the-first-person-to-be-hanged-for-his-crime.html)
It is estimated that more than 4 million slaves were sold into bondage in the U.S. from 1850 to 1860. More than 2 million of these slaves escaped to the North. Many died in transit. This horrific history is documented in Dr. Charles E. Woodberry’s book “Beyond Slavery and Abolition‚: An American Tragedy. It is the subject of a documentary film entitled ” The First Negro Hangings„, with the Academy Award winner Michael Moore (‘The Terms‟). The film tells the story of Bezet and two other escapees who were murdered by Union soldiers.
Bozeman, Montana
On Sunday, February 8, 1963, two African American prisoners were executed in Bozeman. A crowd of several hundred people had gathered at a roadblock just outside of town, hoping for an audience with Confederate General Robert Lee. But the soldiers were gone. Their soldiers had left the state, and were now on the warpath in South Dakota. As a news photographer snapped this picture, one soldier held up his rifle and said, „Don′t bother us, we are going to Bozi. You got any money?‖. He then shot the photographer in cold blood. After the soldier shot, someone grabbed his weapon and killed him. Although the killings were later discovered to have been a random act, no arrests were made. Shortly afterwards, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited all racial discrimination in public accommodations. Three years later, on March 24, 1968, four people were killed in a lynching in Mississippi. They were white and black. Two black youths and a white boy were raped and then lynched. Both black boys were eventually buried in unmarked graves. Years later in 2017, in Shelby County, Alabama, forty white men were found guilty of lynchings. Nearly a quarter of all black people lynCHED IN 1838, 1872, AND 1915

In the year 1873, Louisiana was the site of another lynchin‛, when thirty whites and seven Negroes were condemned to die. Over one hundred white criminals and sixteen Negro criminals were convicted of murdering an innocent man. Sixteen of their victims were black, including an old black woman, Mrs. Margaret Holmes, who was beaten to death. She was burned to prevent her from identifying the perpetrators. Four of her children were thrown from a high bridge into the river, although it has never been determined whether the bridge was actually a rail or a ferry.

Disability Rights In August of 2004 attorney Richard Bernstein filed a class-action," lawsuit against the City of Kansas City, Missouri alleging violations of disabled person’s civil rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The lawsuit claims the city is failing to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities, including those in its Special Services program.

In their May 21, 2006 order granting summary judgment, the district court noted the plaintiffs failed to cite any authority which would support their claim that the Special Service Program was an inclusive facility. In fact, because there was no evidence the program was required to be inclusive, it did not violate the ADA. Additionally, they failed adequately to address the issue of whether the special services program met the “reasonable requirements” set by federal law for programs serving people who are disabled, as stated in the Department of Education‘s regulations. Finally, although the court recognized the existence of a genuine issue regarding whether KansasCity is aware of its affirmative obligations under section 504 (i.e., is not willfully disregarding the requirements), the parties were required at a minimum to show the agency has an adequate system in place to facilitate compliance with the law. Therefore, on appeal, we will proceed under a plain error standard. Under that standard we may reverse the judgment only if the error ‘resulted in serious injustice or a miscarriage of justice.‟ We find no miscarriage here, and accordingly, affirm the decision of Judge Haikala.


A. Standard of Review
1. Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); Anderson v.: United States, 201 F.3d 1242, 1246 (10th Cir. 2000). To defeat a motion for summary judgement, therefore, „the nonmoving party must do more than merely show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts‒that is, for example, `there must be a ․genuine dispute over factual issues. [Citation.] A ‡genetic disputing does not warrant a directed verdict if ‛the record taken as whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving side...[Citations.]‖ ’ ” Celis v: Am. Tel. & Tel., Inc., 72 F Supp 2d 1369, 1372 (Jud 26, 1999) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. Ltd.ji v Nederland, 101 F 3d 1064, 1070 (CA 9 1996)). Where reasonable minds could disagree as regards the conclusions drawn from undisputed facts, summary adjudication is proper. Saucier v, United Staes Serv. Group, Inc.2 ____ F3 d 1026, 1027 (11th cir. 2002); see also, FedJl'sr Rules Ctrv 6.5(a) (""If the evidence is merely colorable, or is susceptible to contrary construction, a summary disposition may be granted.""). Moreover, when opposing a properly supported motion, such as one for Rule 56 summaryjudgment,,the adverse party ‐ the movant ‑ must put forth specific facts showing ‚that there remains a trialworthy issue. If the opposing party fails to meet this burden, there can be no resolution of disputed issues, since a full trial on the merits would be necessary.  ‰Id. (citations omitted).
2. Reversing the Summary Judgments
It is clear that summary judgments are inappropriate in lawsuits alleging discrimination under 42 U 0' Civil Statutes, especially those cases in which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. Celko v New York State Dept. of Labor, 168 F id 516, 521 (1995) ('The sole purpose of requiring a party bringing an employment discrimination case to produce direct evidence of intentional discrimination is to prevent the imposition of burdensome evidentiary procedures on plaintiffs in employment disputes. Direct evidence means that a discriminatory motive is apparent on face of claimant's testimony. This standard is different from a presumption of discrimination. It is sufficient to overcome a rebuttable inference of unlawful discrimination.' ) (emphasis added)"".
But even when a litigant has the initial burden to prove a claim by a preponderance of evidence, once a defendant establishes a prima facie case, plaintiff need not submit any additional evidence to satisfy his ultimate burden. Rather, he ′may rely on either direct or circumstantial evidence. Although the two standards are quite different, both types of circumstances have a common element. Put simply, circumstanting evidence demonstrates the absence"
"Does BCRA really work? An investigation into the Re-election of Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. Since her election on November 2, 1982, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur"," has held this seat, previously held by Congressman David Loughner. The district has been represented by two Senators (Chuck Grassley) since 1981. In recent elections, Kapputur was re-elected to Congress in 1998, 2000, 2008 and 2016.

Kapptur’s Campaign: In 1982 Krenick, who was then the Chair of the Committee on the Judiciary, introduced a Congressional resolution to investigate whether Kammulberg should be allowed to run for Congress. Kasprow, the candidate for Congressman, supported the resolution, but his name was not placed on it. This was an election year, and the Democrats needed the support of their base. Senator Grassley opposed Krasnig and asked Kaspersky to withdraw from the race. Ultimately, Grassley agreed to support Kaspprty. Although he was defeated by Kasym, he remained a member of Washington State‘s congressional delegation for life. Throughout his career, Kaspprtry worked tirelessly to represent the people of his district. His political actions continued after leaving office. He was one of only five Republicans to vote against the repeal of “Don” King, a law enacted in 1973 that forbade the sale of handguns in Washington state until the completion of a mandatory background check. Later, when the ‘don‟s amendment„ to the Washington Post was amended to allow guns in all homes, Sen. Kasparrthy voted against it, instead voting in favor of legislation that would allow states to ban the purchase of certain handguns. As a result of this action, Senator Kasprrtthy lost his bid for reelectibility. During his last term in the House, Senate, where he served part-time as a committee aide, Ken was recognized for his service to his constituents. Due to a heart attack, Incumbent Senator Kastrry was able to seek reelection to another term, serving in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U S Senate. Shortly after being reelected, Governor Schafer announced that he will seek reelection in 2018. Prior to running for governor, Schaffer served as the Chairman of Health Care Reform, which was a key campaign issue during the 2016 election. Other than Senator Schgarfer‚s loss to Gov. Schirmer in 2014, no other member has ever lost a statewide race at any level of government. Republican voters are still out there, though, because they still support the party. However, if you ask them, they will tell you that they have not found anything wrong with the way the Democratic Party is run. There is something wrong, however. Not just with individual candidates, or even the parties themselves. What they believe the Republican Party does is wrong. After all, anyone who questions the priorities of these two parties is labeled as „right wing“ or ‹a Nazi.› They are not right wing, nor is the Democrat Party. Both of those parties are comprised of people who believe that the government should control everything. Neither party believes that government must provide the majority of benefits to everyone. Just as there are those who want a strong military, there also exists those whose views are aligned with those of domestic terrorism. Many of us have heard arguments about the dangers of radical Islam. Should we kill them? Or should we let them keep coming? The answer is neither. We must find a way to prevent them from coming here. Our approach should fit within the values of our country. If our foreign policy is to be a war on terror, then we should have a policy that includes a peaceful resolution of disputes and a resolution that makes it easier for individuals to move safely and freely around the world. Unfortunately, our leadership in Congress has done nothing to change either our policy or our approach to this conflict. Instead, we have chosen to continue the same approach we took before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It is time we think outside the box and bring together the perspectives of every American who believes we can solve our problems through a better way. Anywhere else, such an initiative would be met with derision and ridicule. Here in our nation‱we have the potential to do much more to meet the challenges we face. That is why we must call on our elected leaders to adopt the solutions we share today. Everyone agrees that our ability to produce goods and services is severely limited. More specifically, it is estimated that nearly half of all goods manufactured each year go into mass production and then distribute products across the country for consumption. For example, 70 percent of food is produced domestically. According to data gathered by The Nonprofit Research Council of America, over the last year food production has increased by 50 percent. Consequently, United States�"
The Many Faces of Populism in Latin America Populism is a term that has frequently been used to," refer to various political movements in several Latin American countries, such as the Movimiento por la Democracia and Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Argentina, the Centro de Estudios Sociales del Ecuador (CESES), the New Alliance (ANP) and Acción Nacional para la Buena Vista En Paz y el Fomento de las Gente (AENP), among others. In the most recent decade, scholars have focused on Latin Americans' use of populist ideas, especially in terms of their political orientation and articulation. The first Latin-American research on populism specifically came from the Latin@ Research Center in Washington, D.C., which was led by author María Teresa Santamaría-Gutiérrez. She conducted a study in the U.S. in 2015, and in 2017 published an introductory essay on the topic, which provided important insights regarding populism in its many forms and implications for social movements.

Research has long pointed out that different populations in different countries can display characteristics similar to each other, with people living in urban environments being more prone to support progressive policies and attitudes than people in rural locations. This has been particularly true of Latin Amerian populations, who have shown lower civic participation than their neighbors in Europe, Africa and Asia. Studies have also found similarities between the countries of Central and South America, particularly Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil. For example, studies from Argentina's Oaxaca State University and the National University of Colombia have found that Venezuelan students have a similar level of satisfaction with the state compared to Colombians or Bolivians. Other researchers have looked at Latinamerican communities living outside of the cities as well. They found a high prevalence of social mobility in both rural and urban communities, suggesting a common desire for better life for all members of society. These findings have not only been supported by field studies, but also by surveys. Public opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of people believe in social justice and that it is the government's job to provide it. However, perceptions of a sense of justice can change over time. Additionally, when pollsters ask respondents to rate the levelness of democracy in their country, they tend to rank the quality of life much lower than the amount of corruption, economic inequality, violence and discrimination. Polls also point to the importance of having a strong civil society in any country—as well as a willingness to seek opportunities for self-improvement. Just as Latin american countries are becoming more urbanized, this trend is increasingly causing them to adopt progressive social and political policies. Due to these similarities, many scholars speculate that LatinAmerica may be a case where populism could be considered the third wave of liberalism, once the previous two waves of reaction and then the reform movement of 2008–2010 were thought to be the two main drivers of change. Although the term populism has primarily been applied to certain LatinAmerican countries such us Argentina and Venezuela due to their greater degree of urbanization, there have been instances where it has referred to societies with more rural-type environments. LatinAmericans are also more likely to belong to disadvantaged social classes and are more affected by economic inequity and poverty, though some scholars suggest this is simply because they are located in economically disadvantaged countries. Furthermore, because of these socioeconomic differences, LatinAmericans tend not to perceive themselves as having the same interests as people from other backgrounds, showing a greater interest in getting ahead socially and politically. Popular movements based on these beliefs include organizations such Asociacion Bolívar (AB), Red Democratic (RED) or El Frente Patriótico Popular (FPP); all of which are still active and operate on a grassroots level.

 Political Party 
Some scholars argue that populist movements are often dominated by particular political parties. Both of those parties have historically been responsible for the governments of several countries in Central/South America. A number of scholars noted that populism typically exists in authoritarian states where a one-party state is established. Also, populisms tend be associated with parties with strong religious affiliations. More specific examples of populistic parties include El Liberalismo Nómada (ALN), Cambio DemocrátICO (CDIC), Movimentos para Vamos (MVP), Los Síntomas (LST), Unión Democrata (UD) etc. Among these parties, ALN and ALNA are the largest and most powerful parties in Honduras and Nicaragua respectively. Based on their ideology, populist parties can sometimes be divided into right-wing or radical right parties and left-right parties respectively: right wings tend generally to oppose socialism and communism and to advocate capitalism; left wings promote social democracy and equality and denounce social injustice. Throughout Latin Americas, various populist political"
Violence and the Nation Introduction: Fear and the Nation The modern nation has a," long history of violent conquest and conflict. The ""great wave of war"" that swept through Europe in the sixteenth century had similar causes, but its scope and consequences were much greater than the Thirty Years War in France. In fact, violence was just one of the factors that made the modern state strong, stable, and powerful. This history makes it easy to understand why the state is a necessary institution, especially in times of crisis. But violence is only one strand in a vast web of causes that give rise to the nation-state, which in turn gives rise once again to violence. Violence arises out of a combination of coercion and consent; coercion is the most powerful force behind all states and can ultimately be used against anyone who resists. A nation's consent is sometimes required before the coercive power of its government will do anything to prevent its citizens from being harmed. Therefore, consent and coercion are interdependent. More generally, the history told by violence also shows how the threat of harm can motivate people to do good things, because they believe the government or authority that threatens them will prevent them from getting hurt. History tells us that violence can be a powerful tool for good as well as for evil. Many people seem to fear the death penalty more than any other punishment, no less than political leaders or other public officials. Not all people have the same motives for violence—for instance, some feel threatened by torture, others by death—but each group feels threatened in different ways. Although the majority of people agree that the criminal justice system is harsh and unjust, not all agree with the way in which it is applied. Everyone agrees that criminals should be punished, though some see this as a violation of their rights, while others believe it encourages more cooperation between the police and criminals. Both groups share the sentiment that crime is bad, although there are significant disagreements about what justifies this verdict. Every group hopes that its society will be better off if it can prevent some criminals from ever hurting someone else. Given this desire to be good, it seems likely that everyone thinks that violent crime will happen less and that it will occur less often. If everyone agreed that every homicide victim deserved to die, then the incidence of murders would be greatly reduced. People want to know that killers won't kill again, so they demand that murderers be put to death. Finally, those who feel that life itself is at stake, when we discuss our country, feel compelled to speak up and say something about injustice. Our country is not perfect, nor is it a utopia, yet it has an excellent reputation for being a peaceful place. One might think that this is due to our commitment to liberal values, such as tolerance and respect for differences, rather than our willingness to use violence as part of our political culture. There is evidence to suggest that our national character is tied to whether or not we view violence seriously. Other countries, like Germany, France, Sweden, Italy, Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States, Holland, Scandinavia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Singapore, Israel, Costa Rica, Turkey, Nepal, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Rwanda, Sudan, Algeria, Mozambique, Ghana, Gambia...are all thought to have a high level of tolerance for non-violent conflict compared to their neighbors. It is obvious that these countries regard violence on both sides as morally wrong, since they have stronger political institutions and a higher level civil society. Still, these nations allow for serious violence to occur, with murder rates typically around 50% lower than those in developed countries. However, they still have high rates of violence overall. According to some researchers, half of all homicides are gang-related, constituting 25% of homicides in Switzerland. Rates of domestic homicide are also quite low, even compared with some countries such Asadullah Yusuf and Daniel T. Schmid, ""Consequences of Human Aggression: An Overview of Recent Research on Aggressive Behavior,"" Journal of Applied Social Psychology, vol. 36, pp. 483–490, 2013.

Bureaucratic Authoritarianism
–
It is argued that bureaucratic authoritarians, who are responsible for implementing the rules and regulations of an institution or a government, are thus not really free agents. Any attempt to conceive a free market would inevitably end in authoritarianism. To defend the freedom of bureaucrats, therefore, is to defend liberty. Yet, this conception of freedom does not take into account that a regime that is democratic, legal, egalitarian, pluralistic, regulated, hierarchical, centralised, bureaucratic, rigid, undemocratic, unresponsive, totalitarian, uncivil, authoritarian, etc. are all results of bureaucracy, hence, bureaucratization. Bureaucratizers, on the other hand, can only produce a totalitarian"
"Human Rights Debates Presented by William Slomanson, Jack Donnelly & Oona Hathaway The idea of Universal Human Rights (UHR) was largely developed"," by the European philosophers and political theorists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These writers worked to develop concepts of universal human rights in order to preserve and advance human freedom from domination by non-human entities. This article explores the history of UHR and its development throughout the twentieth century, with a focus on the theoretical formulations provided by British and American thinkers. Theoretical insights regarding human liberty and equality are considered, as is the evolution of these notions through time. Finally, the article examines the recent history surrounding human-rights discourse in the U.S., Canada and the United Nations, and outlines the future of human right discourse.

Introduction In the years since Universal Declaration of Human’s Rights were proclaimed, significant debates have ensued regarding the status of certain fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly in relation to the protection of life, health and dignity, peace, economic, social and cultural rights. In particular, these debates highlight the need for a renewed focus to be placed on human well-being and respect for human dignity. Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that there have been significant changes in URR discourse since the beginning of this millennium. Although the last few years have witnessed a sharp increase in global human activism, little attention has been devoted to what can be considered the most fundamental aspect of rights: human identity. More specifically, there has yet to appear an effort to seriously analyze the implications of “universal human” in terms of its use both to represent the ‘universal‘ ideals of freedom, equality and liberty as well as to convey a sense of solidarity with oppressed minorities. As well, much of what is now being discussed around the topic of inclusion and inclusiveness, which has long occupied a large area of scholarship within and beyond the fields of ethics and philosophy, has focused on ideas such as the equality of persons and/or the rights of refugees. Yet, despite the importance of addressing the concerns of people of colour, women, LGBT, refugee and other marginalised communities, few efforts have truly taken into account the way in which human identities, especially those of vulnerable groups such us LGBT and refugees, intersect with notions of equality. Therefore, although we should remain vigilant against any mistreatment or exclusion of any group based on race, religion, sex, gender, class, etc., we also have to consider the ways in wh…
It is proposed that, since universal rights are only granted to persons in so far as they share the same interests and values, their identification should be based primarily on their shared humanity. Such a perspective is one which recognises the fundamental role that differences play in human experience and that it may be necessary to recognise and defend those differences. Our discussion will explore the relationship between the universal and specific human aspects of humans in modern day discourse; how this relates to our everyday lives and to each individual‟s rights; and how the human subject becomes more complex and involves multiple identities including those based in race and gender. Furthermore, we will take a closer look at how human subjects are still being framed within current discourses of oppression, discrimination and discrimination based upon race. We then consider some of those currently active in tackling these issues, including debates about inclusion, equity and racism, discussing how they affect the treatment of marginalized groups. Ultimately, this research aims to move beyond a concern for the elimination of injustice to examining the necessity of considering who we are as a human species. Human identity is thus no longer seen simply as an abstraction but rather as something that must be understood, acknowledged and defended. [1]
1 Introduction The word „humanity‖ comes from the Latin ‚homo‛, meaning ›man‼. Homo sapiens is sometimes used to refer to all members of a species, though this is not the only usage. Other uses include ‹homon› or ′homun‹.

The United Nations' Balance of Sovereignty and International Human Rights﻿ The United Nations charter is a living document that is," constantly updated. In fact, the Charter was revised in 1946, 1963, 1969, 1977, 1991, 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2016. The Charter's purpose is to facilitate the maintenance of law and order in the international community, and to ensure respect for human rights in all parts of the world. This can be achieved by means of a worldwide legal system, which is based on the principle of ""structure, legitimacy and obligation,"" with the United States as the most powerful nation in terms of its membership. Although the U.S. has been the only nation ever to be granted this status, other countries, such as Canada and Brazil have also been granted similar status.

There is no doubt that the current balance between the sovereignty of nations and their responsibility towards others is one of concern for many people around the globe. As the charter does not specify how much authority any nation should have, it is best described as a general principle. However, because there are differing interpretations of this principle, there is little agreement as to what is the correct balance of power in different parts o...

“The Charter of Human rights gives mankind a sense of security and dignity, not only in time of war but also in peace, when the governments of peoples are able to combine their forces and overcome the hostility of an external foe.” - John Foster Dulles
Human rights are the natural complement of freedom, both in individual lives and in societies. Through them, people define themselves and establish their relationship with others. To make human society possible, therefore, everyone must accept responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons and freedoms of others within her borders. (1948)

"Electoral Reform and Political Parties Within Indonesia Following President Suharto's resignation in 1998, the electoral reforms passed"," were a constitutional reform. The first two were constitutional changes that allowed for direct elections, with the last one being the election of a new president. In 1999, Suhito was elected president and in 2001, he took office as a member of the House of Representatives of Indonesia. Between 2002 and 2004, no new electoral system was implemented due to political conflicts between Suad and President Nasution.

Following the 2001 general elections held under Nasuto, his party was able to increase their number of seats in the Senate by two, taking their seat after a long fight with his supporters who accused them of having rigged the voting. This occurred because the Indonesian Constitution stipulates that only candidates who have a large number votes count in any election (for more information on the 2000 elections check out: ). After the 2004 general election, Nasuti's party won two Senate seats. During this period, however, there was an increasing trend of more liberal policies in both houses. Additionally, other major parties also gained seats such as the Democratic Party, which was led by Sukarno, and the New Power party which received support from Suaipan. Ultimately, this increased the power of Nasutop members, who eventually pushed the president to step down.

Moved the National Unity Party to the opposition position and formed a coalition with Parti Nasirudin Dalam Prosperitas. Former Prime Minister, Habib Rasyid returned to politics to run for Vice-President in November 2000. Raimundir Soemantri served as Chief Minister in August 2000, when Nasutyo was deposed. Other members of Parliament were elected in April–August 2000:  Samipati Sulistyo, Soelantoro Aji, Muhammad Syarifuddin, Akbar Tirtizap, Samuli Sjahrir, R.Sikari, Suruhan Mahmud. Saksi Wirapandi became the third Prime minister in December 2000 but resigned shortly thereafter. Finally, Ejusan Djarum won a seat in Parliament in March 2001. Under this political system, a strong majority government is formed. Due to this, parliament has the ability to pass laws even when not in session. Although the previous election system is unable to be used, since the government forms the majority in parliament, it can pass many laws. As of July 1, 2008, seven parties currently hold seats at the level of President of Republic of Yogyakarta. Many parties continue to exist, such these parties include Jember Sosialis, PSD, KRI, PKI, LMM, PDI and PT.JK. (Pelagus dan Kemajuan Keamanan).
 On October 3, 1999 the Parliament of Kartossol Ulama (KU) voted in favor of passing a law that would allow for the conversion of State owned land into public property. It also approved the extension of an exemption from income tax to property owned by Indonesian citizens. KU leaders demanded that President Barrow send a letter to Jakarta City Hall to amend the law. If President Bush could not get the letter, then the U.N. must also come up with an amendment to end the exemption. On December 8,1999, President Jarotusabur Rawa signed the bill. When President Rawi returned from a trip to London, she sent the same letter dated December 11, declaring the decision as legal. President Darma Jayawickrama refused to sign the document as she opposed the measure. She threatened the Cabinet, claiming that the President was making an illegal decision. Consequently, on February 19, 2000 the parliament approved a bill that further exempted state owned property from paying property taxes. Therefore, only the state controlled companies would be able pay the tax. However, Governor of Central Bank, Mulya Kusumartono, continued to object the measures. He declared the plans illegal and vowed that if President Widodo would not withdraw his administration, all state companies will be forced to close.

The Politicization of American Healthcare as seen in the Reauthorization of SCHIP and its Effects on the American Public  Introduction The issue of health care in America has not," been static, nor has it been monolithic. Many of us have heard from friends or neighbors that our hospitals and physicians are in disarray and that we are being treated like second class citizens. This is simply not the case! Although the history of medical reform is complex, there are three key issues that have led to this current situation. The first is the politicization (or lack thereof) of the medical profession itself. In the United States, the doctor-patient relationship has always been dominated by politics. It is only now that more patients are coming to expect that doctors can make a difference in their lives. Additionally, political leaders have tried to undermine the quality of care and patient satisfaction they see as a priority for their constituents. Finally, politicians have used health policy to advance their personal agendas. These are the factors that led Congress to reauthorize SCHIAP (and all Medicaid and Medicare programs) in 1998, after almost twenty years of ineffectual efforts. More importantly, these are also the same reasons that lawmakers have resisted the important reforms of managed care. As former Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) stated during the 1999 SCHIA debate: ""The real problem is that [Congress] was running out of time... because they had to let the Medicare cost overruns go. Now they're going to be using their new power to do something about what's wrong with Medicare."" 1 Nonetheless, many Americans continue to support SCHP and to believe that it will improve the health of their communities. Despite these positive sentiments, however, policymakers cannot ignore the fact that the U.S. healthcare system is increasingly politicized. Although SCHIS may be a relatively small program, its scope and scope across the entire federal government are enormous. 2 Thus, SCHIs are a direct reflection of a larger, but more pervasive, problem. Politicians have embraced health reform and health systems without recognizing the problems that result from politicizing them. Ironically, instead of addressing the fundamental issues of healthcare reform, they have focused on ways to increase political influence and maximize the political power of physicians and medical organizations. Consequently, policies that would benefit the most vulnerable in society are often the ones that get the least attention. Unfortunately, such policies have a strong potential to erode the public's faith in medicine and lead to less-than-informed decisions about which care options are most appropriate for individuals. By the end of this article, you should have gained a greater appreciation of why the fight over healthcare has become so complicated, and why we need a renewed commitment to reform. Please note that I am not making any claims regarding the long-term consequences of politicisation of medicine. Nor am I advocating for any particular solution. Rather, I hope to highlight how healthcare is affected by the actions of politicians and how they affect the way in which Americans receive healthcare. Ultimately, although we should want our healthcare to provide the best possible care to everyone, we also need to ensure that those who need it most are able to access it. Fortunately, legislation that helps to facilitate the expansion of choice in healthcare delivery is starting to move forward. However, significant changes are still required before the provision of quality care becomes truly possible. To illustrate this point, let me offer two examples. Both of these examples are based on one of my own writings. My original version of Schiaparism (1998) described the current state of play in Illinois. I argued that, while SCHPI is a somewhat marginal insurance program in terms of its size and benefits, it has the potential of being the answer to many of our nation's health problems. While I continued to encourage the Illinois legislature to embrace the reform proposal, my original proposal was that SCHPP be expanded to cover all eligible people in all regions of Illinois and then to include SCHIPP.2 The Illinois legislators did not take my proposal seriously and instead chose to adopt a different approach. They rejected the SCHRIP formula proposed by Governor Wallace and chose instead to expand the state's SCHIPS program to all low income families. Due to political pressure, other states have followed their example and have adopted reforms similar to SCHPS. Thus SCHIMR has expanded throughout the country, with the exception of Washington State, where SCHIRP was introduced. Similarly, Medicare has developed into a system that is accessible to the majority of Americans, including those with low incomes. Therefore, expanding SCHPMR to encompass all Americans seems much more feasible than expanding it to only lower income Americans. Indeed, because the costs of an individual's medical care are borne by his/her entire family, this type of reform provides an excellent solution to improving the accessibility of affordable care for all. But unfortunately, once the reforms are underway, does it change the structure of society? It seems that any reform that"
"Moral Approval and Disapproval A. J. Ayer arrogantly proclaims in Language, Truth and Logic",", ""There is no value in any society whatever for any form of life which cannot be defined by its capacity for moral approbation."" Such a view of ethics would be a serious indictment of civilization. (A.J.A., p. 48) This view, however, is founded on two premises: 1) there is a natural moral value for life; and 2) the existence of a human society in which there are laws, customs, and institutions that encourage or discourage the practice of certain kinds of behavior is conducive to the welfare of society. In fact, such a conclusion is the most natural outcome of an act of moral approval or disapproval. The reasonableness of such an account of morality is best illustrated by a case that I have observed many times in the past several decades. It concerns a man who is taking an old woman for his wife. She is old and in poor health, so he has decided to marry her as soon as she is able to support herself. He has provided her with a little money and some means of support. On this occasion, though, he finds it difficult to obtain the assent of his neighbors to his wish to wed the woman, because he refuses to accept the claim of their neighbors that the marriage would cause them more sorrow than joy. Their claims are based on the same standard of social approval that Ayn Rand condemns. Thus, although he may offer the bride money in exchange for her services, the refusal of the neighbors' consent to marriage causes the man to be condemned by his fellow citizens. This is not a moral judgment, but an acceptance of another's view about what it is appropriate for society to do. Nor is it a judgment that is based primarily on human utility. Quite simply, it involves a recognition that society's actions may not be compatible with the values of its members. Given this point of view regarding morality, Aryan society is seen as a utopia. By the standard that it applies to human welfare, therefore, this society appears as an evil society from a purely natural standpoint.2 As I describe in my book Moral Approvals and Denials, since the natural and the ethical are inextricably bound together in this perspective, we should not expect a similar result if one were to adopt the ASEAN conception of human rights.3 This, again, illustrates the need for applying the Kantian idea of negative liberty. For example, consider this example from my 1997 book, Moral Disagreement. Someone is walking down a road and sees a dog. To his astonishment, when he comes to a fence he sees the dog standing on it. So he approaches the fence and lets the animal off the leash. Not only did this action violate AYARAN standards of legality, namely, that he had the authority to let the beast off, now he also violated human norms of mercy, kindness, decency, honor, humanity, generosity, etc. Therefore, once again we see that, for Kant, there was no difference between the two principles of law. If the laws were the only principle of justice, then the actions of these two men could never be reconciled. We can see this even more clearly when we consider Kant's reasoning for why the neighbor's consent is wrong. Our good neighbor gave him permission to take the girl for a walk. But now, having done so, our neighbor will refuse to speak to him. Would this mean that our former neighbor had no authority over our conduct, or was justified in ignoring us? The answer is that here we have a clear case of double standards. One of Kant's main tenets is his claim that we can never justify our choices of how to behave according to our own wishes. Now, Kant is aware of people doing things that are not in accordance with their wishes, especially when they are young. These cases, which he labels the ""principle of freedom of choice,"" are the result of peoples' being ill-treated by society itself, not because they choose to disobey society rather than obey it; nor does Kant believe that such behavior leads to anything bad, other than a failure to live up to one's own moral standards (Kant, 1967, p.: xi). So, if Kant holds that there really is nothing wrong with people disobeying their leaders, why does he hold that those who want to go against the wishes of others are committing an ""evil"" (and therefore unlawful) act? Since Kant sees no room for disagreement between right and wrong, presumably there can be no real disagreement at all. How is this to continue? It seems that Kant has two ways of handling this problem. First, maybe he thinks that persons do not matter much in terms of whether they follow the will of those around them. Second, perhaps he believes that just because we don't like"
"The Pits and Folds of Religious Tolerance With growing world population and globalization, religions are finding themselves"," in a struggle for survival. In fact, the battle of religions is one of the most significant struggles in history. Religion has had to find its place in societies all over the world. The religious groups that thrive in different parts of society are different from those that thrived in the past. This has caused conflicts and tension between the followers of these sects.

Today, it is a common thing to be a Christian or a Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist. However, when we move out of our comfort zones, we start seeing a lot of division within the society. Not only between religions but between their followers. Many people have started to question whether religion is the answer to all problems or is it a form of oppression. It is extremely important to understand what is causing these tensions because it will help us make sense of why people become more committed to their religion. We need to know the reasons why some people remain religious even when there is no religion at all. To start understanding the root causes of religious tensions, let’s talk about religious tolerance and why we need it.


1. Toleration is an act of kindness
A lot happens when people get to this point of being tolerant. People grow up and develop their own sense regarding how they should behave and interact with others. For example, you might think that you could never become a bigot by eating chicken and playing football with someone who is different than you. You may imagine that it wouldn‘t be acceptable for you to play with them because they are a different race. These types of notions are still held onto by people. Therefore, having these notions will keep your thoughts open to certain kinds of behavior, which you would not expect given that they once were considered bad. Having these beliefs can cause you trouble, especially if you have not found a way to express them. Taking on the beliefs of a religion may be seen as a sign of strength. But, if your beliefs are not strong enough to protect you from getting hurt, then you may end up being hurt. If you are being bullied or ridiculed by your religion, chances are you will lose your faith. Remember, tolerating someone“s intolerant beliefs does not mean that he will never do anything wrong, nor does it mean his actions are harmless. Simply put, tolerance is simply a process of seeking to accept other people without making judgments about them.""
Tolerance means that we try to live in harmony with each other, not because we are trying to prove something about ourselves, but because living in such a manner makes us feel good. When we don‟t like someone, or we see them doing something “bad”, instead of just judging, maybe we should try and tolerate them? It feels good to realize that not everyone is like we think they must be. Also, being able to speak up when someone doesn„t listen is very important. Talking about what others think and being heard is something that every person should have the ability to do. Our society is constantly creating new rules about things that used to work just fine in life. Sometimes these rules have turned into rules of hate and discrimination. Being able give feedback to someone helps them learn from their mistakes, and it helps the people around them feel safe to talk and come to decisions. Speaking up is simple, honest, caring and effective. Everyone deserves to have a voice and to feel comfortable with that voice. Whenever we speak out, take the risk of losing our friends, family and standing up for ourselves. Even if we disagree with the way someone is behaving, speaking up gives us a little bit of freedom and peace. Just because someone talks about something does NOT mean they have to like it! Tensions rise because people feel free to say something and feel confident that others won‪t look down on them for saying so. Be open and patient, because sometimes you just have too much to deal with. Finally, remember, taking risks is good, letting them lead you down the road to success. All it takes is taking the first step, giving yourself a chance to shine, until you discover that stepping on a spot where you didn‚t plan to is okay. *****************************
2. Self-Reflection: By thinking about our goals, fears, experiences and ideas, can we eliminate these obstacles and doubts that are holding us back? By self-reflection, I am talking about thinking clearly, carefully and seriously about everything you do and don't do in your life - for example:
Is this really what I want to achieve? What is my goal? Why am I pursuing it? Where do I intend to end? Will it be successful?
How can I overcome this obstacle? How can change this experience? Am I ready for this challenge? Do I have what it take? (not necessarily"
THE EMBEZZLEMENT PROBLEM Is a person morally required to commit a crime in," order to be a human being? The answer to this question has long been debated, with the two sides arguing for and against. In my opinion, the answer is no. The majority of people agree that it’s wrong to intentionally harm someone without their consent, but they disagree over what it means to “hurt someone”. This can be summed up in three key words – pain, suffering, and injury. For example, you can deliberately hurt someone and still be perfectly healthy.

A lot of philosophers have tried to settle this debate, such as David Lewis in his book Moral Pain. Although he doesn‘t go into detail, he generally agrees that pain or suffering is wrong, because an individual must act in accordance with his moral values. Therefore, it is immoral for an agent to cause another person pain (pain) or suffer (suffering) in any way. Other philosophers however, take a different approach, arguing that not hurting another human could still provide some positive benefit. These include Christian philosopher Daniel Dennett who argues that hurting someone just because they need it does not violate moral norms, since we are not morally obligated to help those in distress. Not all moral philosophers follow Dennisty, though, as they argue that we should care about others‟ pain. Many atheists also argue in favor of the view that the only reason not to hurt another is that there is something intrinsically wrong with harming another. I have not found a definitive position here, although there are probably a lot more variations than I can list here. There are certainly many debates about what ‘wrong‚‬ really means. However, I think we can agree on one thing – the majority do not believe it makes sense to kill someone in cold blood without her consent. As far as I know, no one has ever killed someone out of spite, lust, greed, or other similar motive. If we were truly concerned with helping others, we would never do that. It seems that most of us want to end cruelty like this, therefore, when we see a child being bullied at school, beating up a girl friend, torturing a dog, etc., we don‡t hesitate to put our hands on them and let them cry for help. When someone is dying, our empathy is much stronger. We will do everything in our power to prevent them from suffering any more. Just because killing a terrorist is illegal doesn´t make it a good idea. A better idea would be to keep him alive until he„s dead. Killing him would not be necessary, anyway. More humane solutions may result in less deaths overall.




It is clear that even the most hard-core radical anti-humanists consider murder wrong. And yet, there have been many instances where people have actually committed murders that would seem to violate our moral standards. Should we be surprised? People have done it in the past, yes. But if we aren•t willing to live up to the values that made these murders permissible, then why should we try?
I am sure that I am not the first to express doubts about whether killing is morally wrong; there was a time when I thought I had to apologize to those children before I could kill them. That was back in my college years, so maybe I was just afraid. Personally, my first thought after killing was that, hey, now I‱have to start thinking about myself and what I would do if I were a criminal. Since I didn′t understand the principle of double effect, especially in terms of punishment, remorse, forgiveness, repentance, & so on, once I stopped caring about those innocent kids I felt pretty bad about it. Yeah, life wasn‴t fun right then. Oh well, maybe someday I will get over my fear of killing. ;)
No one disagrees that killing someone requires some degree of mercy. Even the ones who claim to reject „cruelty› themselves do acknowledge that taking somebody‰s life involves a high degree thereof. Those of you who feel that death is the same thing as torture, death, hell, fire, water, ice, space, gravity, infinite amounts of time, cosmic nothingness, nth degree, whatever, just remember that you are talking about a sentence. Sentence is a kind of verb. You are telling someone that they are going to die. Meaning that while you may be allowed to tell them that their lives are meaningless, your sentences have a specific meaning which you cannot change unless you choose to. So, speaking for myself, knowing that God has a plan for my life, living in His presence, having His love around me, being in control, not being afraid, carrying the burden of my sins, receiving the gift of salvation, listening to"
Emotivism and Solomon's Theory of Emotions It was suggested in class that Solomon's theory of emotions," is emote-mentalism. I have tried to elaborate on this, but the topic has had no easy treatment. In order for one to be able to understand Solomon, one needs a basic understanding of his theory. Emotivist-sentimentalist theories tend to point out that there is something special about human emotions, namely that they are the expression of the deepest, inner emotional states. (For example: 'I feel sad because...') A similar claim is made by some, though not all, empiricists. Theories of emotion which take the empirical data to support this view have a long history. One such theory is the one put forth by David Lewis in his famous book E.M.S.E.N.T. This theory says that our emotions are derived from a natural, innate biological drive to seek happiness and to avoid pain. These drives are felt in different ways, depending on what level of consciousness we are. If we see the world as a happy place, then we should behave differently. Our emotions will be related to these drives. Some of these emotions may be based on fears and pains. Other emotions might be connected with the way in which we interact with others. However, when we try to explain the nature of our feelings using this theory, we run into the same difficulties as those faced by empiricist theories of affect. When one looks closely at how these theories attempt to account for the experience of love, for example, they appear to fail. Love seems to express a deep, primordial, unconscious desire to merge ourselves into another person. It seems that love cannot be understood as the desire of a particular individual to satisfy a specific need. More generally, it can be shown that any theory which gives us a description of an individual's feelings must explain why he behaves the manner in question. Any attempt at an explanation of why someone acts the behaviour that he does must be linked to some deeper, underlying state of mind. What happens when one tries to figure out what the basis of this underlying motivation is? The answer to this is that it is simply impossible to do so. We can find evidence for these underlying motivations in behaviour only if it has been recorded. But where would you find such documentation? Why would we expect to find it? Would you expect it to exist at some point in time? And if you ask why we would expect such records to arise, you will get the answer that the only possible explanation is one which would allow us to reinterpret past events. Therefore, my suggestion is to look elsewhere for evidence. Instead of looking at the source of certain emotions or desires, let's start by looking elsewhere. For example perhaps we can look at what it means to behave according to certain beliefs. To look back further, maybe the beliefs could be used as evidence to prove that some emotion exists. Suppose that I know that a certain emotion is expressed when I feel that my beliefs are true. Now suppose that before I ever believe anything, I first believe that every belief is true and that consequently I act accordingly. Should I be surprised when this proves to me that this emotion does exist? No, because if I am to accept this hypothesis, other emotions must also have the potential to occur. And they do. So I should be interested in finding out more about the existence of such emotions. Let's look briefly at a few examples. Many people have experienced the sensation of joy. Someone who knows that having this sensation is good for him will experience joy whenever he sees something nice. Similarly, someone who is aware of being in love will continue to feel love even after seeing a nice sight. Both of them will remember feeling this feeling of happiness when they first perceived the sight of their loved ones. Given these two examples, isn't it pretty clear that these are cases in point of actual instances of pleasure? Of course not. Even if we take these examples as examples of strong evidence, there are still a lot of things we don't know about what actually happens during the pleasure process. How exactly does a sense of delight come about? What part of us is affected? How is it shaped? When we think of experiencing pleasure, does it look like this? That is, is there a form of satisfaction? It is clear to everyone that pleasure is much more complicated than that. Perhaps we could call pleasure 'the feeling' - but what exactly is a 'feeling' compared to the phenomenon of pain? Perhaps pain is better called 'an emotion'. But again, what does an emotion mean? We might assume that anger is an ""emotional"" reaction. Indeed, anger often follows from frustration, sadness, or despair. Anger is typically accompanied by aggression. There is also a category of hatred, although it does not usually cause aggression towards another. Finally, perhaps the most obvious example of passion is love. Although love"
Reliabilism In this paper I examine the reliabilist theory of justification.," This view of justifying acts as a process is very different from other accounts of justificatory behavior. The reliaBLE Theory of Justification: It is argued that it can be used to explain a range of plausible, though often tacit, causal and epistemic phenomena. (1) A Reliable account of a person's action in a specific situation. Given the variety of situations one can find oneself in, it is possible that any one of these situations may provide a case for justification; but some circumstances are likely to be more likely than others. Consequently, there is a reliable estimate of whether any particular action should be accepted or rejected. Thus, the theory suggests that agents should have some reason to act with high probability on a given occasion. 2.2 The Reliability Theory of Action Theories There are many theories of action. In particular, one might be interested in the reliability theory.11 Reliabilities are estimates about the likelihood of an event occurring. They are influenced by many factors. For example, in many instances we do not know the truth of certain claims, although we think we know it. Therefore, when we evaluate the credibility of some claim, we make use of the same judgments as when evaluating other claims. 12 This is the source of skepticism and disbelief. We need to assess the confidence people have in their assessments. Some of us will believe in no matter how well supported our inferences are. Others will only if we receive contrary evidence. Many of our judgments will be influenced along with the beliefs we entertain. These influences can alter the way we judge. To illustrate, consider two different scenarios. Suppose that I have a false belief that, on the basis of previous information, I know that the answer to question 11. Note that we don't have to assume that our criteria for judging are reliable. So, for example we might decide to believe a proposition because we believe that its counterpart would be a falsehood. 11 has been provided. Then, my credence in question is low, because I doubt that answer. But suppose that here, too, someone tells me that question has actually been answered. I should then increase my confidence in answering question, since now I see that my original credences were right. More generally, if you're assessing your confidence according to some standard, you should give some credeis in accordance with that standard. That is, whenever you have reasons to accept a claim while doubting it, your credencie should increase. However, sometimes you could also give credencias in response to reasons that are completely unrelated to the ground of your belief. 13 1. Evaluating a credense When a belief is evaluated, something is at stake. It matters whether the evaluation is accurate or inaccurate. If, e.g., I believe the proposition 'I am at the beach' but the belieposson appears to me to entail that 'the beach is like the sea', then I will take my belief to fail. On the other hand, such an evaluation might not be accurate. Imagine that someone asks me, 'What is your name?' and I answer, ""I don' t know."" Now suppose she shows me a photo of me and says, ''My daughter is there."" Of course, she's not saying anything about my daughter. She's simply asking me about myself. Yet, her question does not entail either that her daughter exists or that she is near the ocean.13 Since my answer is irrelevant to whether I am in fact at a beach, nor is it directly pertinent to who my child is. Hence, even though the question clearly involves some uncertainty, those doubts do seem unjustified. As I discuss in section 6, a similar argument can apply to many other kinds of questions. Moreover, let us add another variation. Let me ask a question of myself, and suppose further that afterwards I meet someone else. Now the two of them may disagree about what I said. And if they do, each of their answers may involve some degree of uncertainty. Consider, again, two possible responses. One could say, ""'You're at your holiday.'"" The other, possibly, might say "" 'You are at camp.' "" In order to understand what they mean, they should both be judged in terms of accuracy.14 But, once again the judgment is not based on any actual facts. Both may be correct.15 And both may include some measure of inaccuracy. Although the first choice may seem more plausable, so long as the second choice is fairly easy to amend,16 it may still be wrong. Indeed, anyone who takes the attitude that he believes the latter is probably mistaken. What happens when a judgment seems accurate doesn't follow from the fact that there was no real difference between the parties. Neither the one who knows the true answer nor the non-responding third party will ever know"
"Hypothetical Imperatives, Moral Imperatives, and the Objectivity of Values If we accept Mackie's account of the nature of ethical"," judgment, we have a fairly clear picture of when and why we should give moral advice. The first thing to be said is that, for Mackies, ethics is the application of our principles to particular situations, on the basis of which we make moral judgments as to whether the actions we desire to adopt are those which would be acceptable in all relevant circumstances. We then proceed to evaluate the consequences of these judgments, taking into account any relevant considerations. This is called 'the principle of justification' (PJA), the idea being that the kind of person we are depends on our ability to understand what we're doing. Justifications can be given in terms of certain implications or consequences, such as the prospect of suffering, avoiding harm, having a high-quality life, etc. In order to make good judgments about these sorts of issues, you need to know what it is like to get them right. Our task is to assess the likelihood of meeting our goals in the conditions we face. Although Mackay has developed this line of thought further, it does seem to run through his entire theory, with the specific aim of justifying our actions in cases where we think we'll be facing a range of circumstances that allow us to meet our aims without suffering any significant losses. For example, when we go to a doctor to obtain a prescription for medicine, the doctor will most certainly prescribe the medicine provided he believes it will benefit us. If, however, he is unable to do so, because of unforeseen complications arising from other aspects of his professional life – for example an unforeseen illness or a serious accident involving the prescription – then the medical situation is going to present us with a set of situations that would not permit us obtaining the medication prescribed by the healthcare professional. Whatever the outcome of this assessment, once we've decided that our goal is indeed to prevent the loss of a little money in order for us both to preserve our lifestyle and to avoid some unwanted side-effects, then it becomes apparent that we'd have to modify our view of how much the benefits of treatment really outweigh the losses involved. What Mackey wants to say in this case is something like: ""We needn't take the view that it's wrong to steal food from a starving man, nor that stealing food is wrong, but we need only take into consideration the fact that there may be a lot of people who eat that food and don't die."" We can see that this is a perfectly reasonable view, since we also need consider the amount of wealth we lose when someone steals food. However, although we may believe that treating the theft of food as a moral wrong makes sense, if we try to explain why this would help us achieve the ends we seek, our argument goes awry. Suppose that a thief is able to cause a death of several hundred people. It might be thought that he would deserve to die; but what if, instead of being able simply to kill the thief, my aim were to rescue him? It seems that I should now want to put a stop to this process of cannibalization, even if it means that some innocent people will die. So I could continue to treat the death as morally wrong if I can prevent it. But this contradicts the principle above, which says that if you treat a loss as wrong and gain some positive consequence, that's not a justification. As long as you're still treating it as immoral, there's no good explanation for why it helps you achieve your end. Consequently, this argument fails.2 Similarly, one might try explaining the morality of killing a human being in such a way that makes it a justified killing. Here again we run into difficulties. First of all, let me qualify the claim that killing is justified in a straightforward way. Killing is sometimes justified. Many people argue that justifiably killing another human is different from justifying killing in any other way, so we shouldn't use the same words. They point to many examples of cases in which killing was justified, including that of Christ and St Peter. Not all killing, though, is unjustifiable. A man who kills another person is committing murder, yet, according to the theory proposed above – and Macky himself acknowledges this – killing someone is not generally justifiable, at least in ordinary situations. More generally, killing requires a greater degree of justification than merely taking an action which results in some definite good for you.3 So while it may appear that Mackying's view has stronger grounding, in fact it has weaker grounds. Taking the case of an individual whose life is at stake, I cannot justify killing him unless there are reasons to think that his life will be greatly harmed. Similarly for someone whose property is taken from him, or someone who is imprisoned, killed, tortured, raped, threatened, blackmailed, robbed, cheated, imprisoned... the list goes"
The Doctrine of Double Effect and Intuitions Regarding Hiroshima and Nagasaki The Doctrine of Double Effect (henceforth referred to as DDE)," is a set of premises that derive from the principle of double effect, and are commonly used to support interpretations of certain military actions as having been undertaken in response to an actual attack against military objectives. In particular, the DBE asserts that a military action which was intended to cause a particular civilian casualty must have been taken in such a way as to be likely to have the unintended consequence of creating a larger civilian population in the target area than was actually present there prior to the military act. This is sometimes referred back to simply as a ""double effect theory.""

This is applied in a variety of ways: It is argued that the Japanese attack on Hiroshima was not intended for civilian casualties, since they had no plans to attack civilian targets, but rather to obtain military advantage; that it could have achieved the same objective by a different route, such as by bombarding Nagazaki; or that its intent to create a large number of casualties was only accidental. The use of DARE in support of these conclusions is called the ""Double Effect Doctrine"".
It is also used in defense of nuclear weapons, inasmuch as the decision to launch a nuclear weapon is the result of a process which can only take place if an adequate number has been selected for a weapon to exist.
In addition, DDO has long been used as an analytic tool by military theorists to assess the likelihood of an attack directed against civilian infrastructure, especially in terms of its effect on the potential civilian victims. Such a view is known as ""principle of proportionality"", and is expressed as follows:
A military operation will be successful only if it has an effect proportional to its intended goal. If a greater amount of people dies than are injured, this is evidence of some error in planning. Therefore, when a war is won by means of military force, it is important to ascertain that every aspect of the war was based on a plan of campaign, with the aim of meeting the specific objective of maximum civilian destruction. (See DDA).
DDA was adapted into the theory of doctrine of war through Professor Robert J. Litan's theory that, ""the principles of warfare are derived from general theories of causation, which may be used directly or indirectly to predict results"" (see JODC). An example of this approach is seen in modern-day military doctrine regarding nuclear deterrence. Under this theory, nuclear armed states maintain that nuclear strikes against enemy targets are only successful if the risk of escalation to nuclear war falls within the parameters of their doctrine. For example, an escalation from a strike against a terrorist or terrorist-influenced target to a full-scale war requires an increase of risk by 50%, and a 50% increase in casualties over the initial attack. Other calculations suggest that an 80% probability of success can be achieved without nuclear engagement, because such an engagement can occur under circumstances where a high level of civilian exposure exists. Additionally, a qualitative change in regime behavior is required before a regime shift occurs. Nuclear-armed states seek to prevent such regime shifts by maintaining a policy that would allow escalation of attacks to full nuclear conflict. A regime change is typically seen as occurring when two states become less capable of maintaining their respective military balance, i.e., less prepared for military conflict, or if one state becomes more confident in its ability to deter or defeat another. Both of those events would be signs of regime instability. Accordingly, regimes with nuclear capabilities would consider nuclear attacks on non-nuclear states as illegitimate. Given this theoretical framework, other military concepts involving the strategic use, deployment, etc. of U.S. strategic nuclear forces are considered ""counterfactuals"" in DPE, including the recent use at Hama of tactical nukes against Russian ICBMs following Russian President Medvedev's stated desire to end nuclear arms competition. There is much overlap between the two approaches, though the application of both is quite different.

 History 
The DCE is one of several related postulates that originate in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (384–322 BC), and have since been developed by some scholars. Aristotle believed that mankind should seek happiness and virtue, not merely safety, peace, prosperity, independence, riches, honors, possessions, ease, reputation, power, honor, freedom, life, death, immortality, fame, beauty, wisdom, education, literature, religion, science, philosophy, logic, politics, ethics, economics, architecture, medicine, astronomy, music, painting, poetry, technology, war, commerce, business, trade, invention, sport, recreation, leisure, travel, pleasure, sex, sleep, bodily health, mental health and health of mind. Although he denied the existence of evil, he also believed in positive evil – the bad consequences of wrongdoing – and in punishment, although he did not"
The Movement of Homosexual Marriage into the Public Sphere Marriage is and always will be a private contract between," the two spouses. The marriage contract is not, therefore, a public institution whose purpose is the promotion of a social good. In the same way, no institution has ever been established for the purpose of promoting a stable family or any other public good or benefit. Under no circumstances should the government or state in any way promote a particular institution or policy.

A gay marriage is only an individual agreement with the consent of the partners to marry and that individual act alone does not constitute a contract. A gay person is simply entering into a legal relationship with someone whom he or she knows or has met. Gay people do not have the status of “married” or ‘domestic partner’. Nor are they legally married in the state of Washington, USA. This does NOT change the fact that a gay couple is legally bound to each other, just as a heterosexual couple would be bound. Legal binding of homosexual couples is actually a violation of freedom of choice. Any attempts to change this behavior is considered discrimination against gay men and women. Therefore, such attempts would amount to a form of harassment against these two groups of people. Consequently, anyone attempting to ban gay couples from getting married must also seek to prohibit any formal recognition of their relationship, whether in a government institution like the church or a state institution. Discrimination against gays by governmental institutions is illegal and immoral. There is no room in our society for any institution that would promote homosexual unions. Such a policy would undermine the freedom we all possess to choose our own mates. Our right to be happy and to express our love and affection for one another is at the heart of our nation. Opposing such a course would clearly amount toward hate and discrimination. Many people who want to restrict marriage for homosexuals would do so for reasons that are completely unrelated to the specific issue of marriage. They would object because they think that marriage itself is wrong and because there is something „wrong‟ about homosexual sexual relationships. These people have no concern for gay or lesbian couples who wish to wed. Rather than trying to prevent them from marrying, they want everyone else to stop. Whatever the reason, the only reason that it is ‚right‘ to oppose gay weddings is that homosexuals want equal rights, which are contrary to their wishes. To try to force the whole community to agree with them by denying them equal access to marriage would represent an act of hatred and oppression. It is time for those who believe in freedom, equality and respect for all people to stand up and say NO! Those who oppose marriage are trying too hard to preserve the unnatural institution of homosexuality. If you truly believe that traditional marriage should be allowed for same sex couples, you can find out how to obtain marriage licenses without government interference by reading this article. Note that the license is available for anyone who wishes to get married even if you cannot afford to pay a $500 marriage license fee. Just send a letter to your local clerk requesting a license and let them know that you intend to apply for a marriage certificate. Be sure to tell them that I have a copy of an article which gives you the steps to applying for your marriage certificates. You may also want some documentation, including birth certificates, baptism records and a death record, for each person you would like to have married. Make sure you have all of these documents since marriage law is different in each state. Once you go through this process, make sure that every single person in your family gets the documents that they need to prove that s/he is ready to begin the ceremony. Remember, once you get the marriage paperwork, it‖s forever. No matter how much time passes, divorce, death or remarriage, there will never be anything official to point to that says that either party was legally committed to another person. All of this is legal, but it has absolutely no legal meaning. Your marriage can be officially recognized now because it already exists. For example, if someone is married, his/her spouse will have proof of his or her identity when he/she comes to visit. Having that proof proves that both parties were legally named on the document. However, this proof does nothing to establish the validity of actual marriage or to invalidate the union of two people living together. Same sex marriage doesn‱t exist yet, so we don‡t have to worry about these things. But if it does, then the laws governing it will take effect soon enough. Please note that our state does allow same-sex marriage, though the definition of what constitutes ′the same gender‴ varies from state to state depending upon the theology and cultural traditions of each country. So please consult with your religious minister to determine what is allowed under his religion. Although it may be possible to technically legitimize same -sex marriages in some states, nobody can legally recognize them until they are officially sanctioned"
Early Fetuses and Constitutional Rights I. The Problem of Fetal Rights The Supreme Court deliberates," on issues relating to unborn children and fetuses. In its most recent decision, _Roe v. Wade_, in 1973, the Court reaffirmed its commitment to the principle of ""unborn women's rights."" However, since then the fundamental legal principle upon which that jurisprudence rests has undergone a fundamental change. This new majority now holds that the constitutional rights of an unborn child are grounded in the unborn fetus rather than in its mother. Many have argued that Roe v. Wade is the most significant change in constitutional law in modern American history.2 It is indeed a watershed moment for the protection of the rights afforded to each and every individual citizen. Although the decision was made unanimously by seven of nine justices, four dissented. A minority of four justices would have upheld the constitutionality of a law that would allow abortion on the basis of gender identity alone, without regard to whether the mother consented or not.3 The majority did not need to refer to this point because the majority's reasoning relied on two premises: (1) the state must have a compelling interest in protecting the life of all persons, and (2) a fetus is a person just as much as a man or a woman. Given these two principles, no court should invalidate a state law merely because it could be shown that it is not in accordance with the Constitution.4 The dissenters suggest that only two states-Missouri and Idaho-follow this line of reasoning.5 They insist that, if the First Amendment guarantees the right to privacy, it does not encompass the privacy of one who is yet to be born. Therefore, laws allowing abortion based on gender can be valid.6 Yet, few seem to agree that there are such laws. Not only is there no consensus among the states on what constitutes a valid statute,7 but there is little consistency among those states that recognize the parental consent requirement for abortion.8 The difference among them appears to reside in whether they acknowledge the existence of fetal rights or consider them mere civil rights.9 What is clear is that a vast majority of states recognize both fetal and maternal rights, while a small minority follows the lead of Missouri and other states and considers fetal welfare to constitute a right that is completely independent of maternal consent.10 This is especially true when it comes to statutes that allow abortions at any time during the pregnancy.11 This distinction is particularly important when we consider the effect of these statutes on human rights in other parts of society. Our discussion will proceed with this assumption in mind. It should be emphasized that I do not mean to suggest from this perspective that courts should not take seriously the possibility that some prenatal health care clinics might be able to provide abortions. Nor do I hold that either fetal or maternal welfare should determine whether a particular provision in a statute is constitutional.12 But, when legislation is brought before a court for review, I doubt whether there will be a large number of judges who believe that any measure taken by a clinic seeking to obtain an abortion is unconstitutional.13 Courts should concentrate their attention on defining the limits of law, not on deciding matters of doctrine.14 In order to understand the issue at hand, however, we first need look at the history of constitutional jurispruation concerning the treatment of fetuall persons.15 In dealing with questions of this sort, scholars have suggested that we should begin with two possible explanations for why the concept of personhood emerged in judicial opinions.16 The first is rooted in Aristotle's account of his relationship to persons in Book I of _Aesthetics_ (Book 5, Chapter 2, 1 935b25).17 This passage indicates that Aristotle believed that persons are essentially different from other objects of knowledge. As I discuss later, Aristotle rejects the claim that human beings have the kind of being that makes them distinguishable from animals.18 Aristotle writes: Persons are different, but they are not unlike anything else.19 The second possible explanation is derived from Plato's discussion of persons and properties in _Republic_ VIII 7, in which he argues against property theories of wealth. Plato describes two types of property: _polis_ property, which has a natural origin, such as land or other land-holding properties, belongs to a community and cannot be alienated, whereas _civitas_ -property, including the land itself, can never become alienated.20 He explains that _aristeia_ is like _kataleia_. The former is something that occurs in possession, ownership, or occupancy,21 whereas the latter is simply an attribute of some object, i.e., it has no intrinsic existence apart from the thing it bears.22 In other words, Aristotelian property implies a property that lacks an intrinsic quality, although it may possess a quality associated with it.23 In contrast, Plato suggests that Aristotelean _daimonia_ has an absolute existence,"
Transaction Ethics I will argue that a transaction to which two parties," are not willing to agree has been completed. The law requires us to assume that the parties were acting in good faith and that they believed they had the same interests as the one who initiated the transaction.

A Transaction to Which Two Parties Are Not Willing to Agree Is Completed
An unanticipated issue arose at a meeting of several hundred people at an annual trade show held in Atlanta. In order to facilitate communications between the attendees of the meeting, various protocols were established by the participants. A number of these protocols required that any transaction conducted at the show be accompanied by a written confirmation of acceptance. These written confirmations were provided to each participant at his or her designated place of registration. Although all participants were required to attend the event, some did not because they did have a concern about the potential for a large number persons to be able to obtain the information needed to conduct a valid transaction through the mailing of a single form. This led to many small transactions being conducted after a member of their organization had received a form and then gone home and mailed it. Based on the concerns expressed at this meeting and the subsequent reactions of some participants, the group decided to adopt the following procedure: Each person was given a slip of paper on which was written the phrase “I am willing” or ‘I would be willing.’ Each party was then asked to sign his name on this slip with his/her initials. After the signature line was complete, each person signed his own name. Finally, copies of all the forms were mailed to everyone listed in the participant list. No-one was required personally to make any representation as to whether they were going to accept the form, nor was any information given to the person completing the Form to indicate how they should respond to it (e.g., ’Do you understand what is contained in this form?‘). Only the names of those signing the document were noted on it; no specific personal information was included. Many of our participants wrote comments on them and were pleased that, since they took the time to write them, they could get the protection of having the documents reviewed before they went out for the day. Those who did receive the confirmation slips were quite pleased, although they made no commitments as part of this process. There were a number who wrote that it felt like a violation of trust. We needn‟t go into detail, because the point is that we don„t know whether the individuals who signed the agreements were truly intending to commit themselves to doing what they said they would do. However, based on what we know now, we can say that most of them did. It might be that more than one individual thought they understood what was intended but didn‚t. At the moment, there are still a few unanswered questions about what actually happened during the formalized process of entering into a relationship, such as why the initial form was used and why it was that only one person had to send the papers. More generally, what happens when a person enters into an agreement with someone other than himself/himself? What happens if he/she is unable to communicate with that person? Why wasn‌nt anyone asked prior to signing any kind of agreement? And, once something is signed, does the letter provide sufficient information to satisfy the standard of good-faith dealing?
It is clear that not everyone was satisfied. Some of us sent the letters without knowing that others had signed them. Others didn't know that anyone else had so long as they weren't involved in any way in setting up a formalizeated process regarding a proposed transaction or providing a confirmation. Still others argued that if the agreement was signed without the knowledge of its actual author, then it should be invalidated as a binding agreement. Our response to these criticisms is simple. If a man agrees to marry someone, and subsequently finds out that she is not the girl he thought she was, isn t this considered a „fraud‖? If another man comes along and agrees that he will marry the woman he found out was not his wife, can he take action against the other man and his self-interests? Yes, yes, my friends. I'm saying that legally, when two people agree to enter into relationships, it is perfectly possible for one to cause harm to another. And that's what happened here. One of your teammates, for example, agreed to meet with you and to invite you to a joint event. You both entered into the contract, expecting that you would mutually fulfill the terms of that agreement and seek to find out the truth about each other. Instead, you found yourself in a position where you were faced with the threat of losing contact with eachother. Both of you wanted to move forward with this relationship but you knew that neither ofyou could rely on either ofthem. Would you have acted differently"
Basic Frameworks of Moral Justification and Hierarchy of Human Needs All of the three basic frameworks of moral justification --," Kantian rationalism, utilitarianism and deontological ethics -- are derived from a common source in Aristotle's Ethics. The basic question of whether all moral facts have objective reality is one to be answered by considering what Aristotle has in mind when he claims that it is the reason why we should judge morally. (See also ""The Nature of Good"" in Book III of Ethics.) As I have tried to show in my earlier work (1 & 2 above), Aristotle gives us a set of criteria for assessing moral justifications. For example, although we may agree that, on Aristotelian criteria, evil is morally wrong, we nevertheless do not take it as a necessary condition of being justified in acting morally that one act is wrong. In fact, Aristotle seems to contradict himself about this point in several of his ethical discussions. This contradiction is taken seriously by his Aristotelean followers. Both Aristotle and his followers argue that our moral judgments are grounded in some form of good will. It is at this stage of Aristotle scholarship that I turn to the issue of what it means for someone to have a good motive. Good motive is defined as the desire or reason that would motivate one person to do something she wants to know which would be good for another person. Although Aristotle does not use the term, I think he intends it to mean that the person who possesses a particular good wish would do the same thing if it were possible. So, for example: If Socrates had the opportunity to steal firewater from Socrates, he wouldn't do it. But since Socrates has an intrinsic good want, namely, to see, no matter what the circumstances, that he will get what he wants, therefore, Socrates doesn't have to fear the loss of water if he steals it; he has a strong desire to get it back.15 This is not the only example of a claim about what I am calling a Good-Motive theory.16 There are others where the motivation is external to a person, such as when I meet the Nobel Prize winner John von Neumann. Von Neuman has two different reasons for attending an international symposium. He has developed a theory of computation based on two sets of axioms: the laws of physics and a mathematical model of an actual world.17 While it may be easy to understand what von Einemmann's theory is about, it can make it difficult to assess whether he is actually motivated by it, because he does things that are contrary to his theory which may seem irrational to us. A similar problem arises with the so-called ""good will"" argument against consequentialists. Against the idea that we have an innate good sense, Kant argues that there is only a subjective good judgment, which he calls a duty.18 The relevant part of Kant's critique of rational morality is that rational persons have non-arbitrary, abstractive knowledge of their own good wills.19 Thus, when we judge how much someone is bound to help us, or what we ought to expect of him, each person is trying to find out what they think is best for herself. If we cannot justify this judgment on the basis of some good feeling, then we can't be justified. Finally, in De l'usage de la conduite (On the Usage of Liberty) Kant discusses the notion of ""usefulness"" of freedom, where people have certain kinds of reasons that guide their actions.20 According to this account, human actions are useful because they are good reasons to behave in a certain way. Many people hold this view about the utility of human freedom.21 Yet, once again, this is a view that seems not to agree with Aristotle. Note, however, the contrast between the Kant and Aristotle accounts. While Kant agrees that people are rational and have reasons,22 he denies that they possess a genuine will to action.23 Rather than a volition to act, his will is an ""appetite,"" which arises from the pleasure or pain of thinking of doing something.24 Although Kant denies the existence of volitional reasons in favor of appearances,25 he still holds that these appearances have the potential to generate a desire.26 We can see this in his discussion of happiness and its conditions. Given that any agent is capable of generating desires,27 it makes little sense to talk of free will in terms of having an independent will without any reason to cause that will 29 See Kant 1993, §41. 30 At the beginning of this chapter, note that while there are some discussions of necessity in Metaphysics, there isn't any discussion here of contingency, since Aristotle mentions necessity mostly in relation to being able to obtain something desired. 31 The first part was written in 1983. 32 This view is defended in different ways by Averroes (Aver. iv.2, iv). For a critical analysis of Aversy's"
"Topic 1: Locke on Primary and Secondary Qualities In the late 1600s, John Locke set out to establish"," a set of qualities that would be necessary for each person to be a good citizen. In particular, Locke believed that a properly educated person could be able to understand and evaluate other people’s rights in such an objective way that makes them more comfortable with the state of society. This project culminated in his A Treatise of Human Nature, where he outlined the conditions that made each individual a human being—free from social and political domination—which would enable them to exist as independent beings. Although Locke was concerned with how individuals might be happy and satisfied in their lives, he also believed they should have a sense of security and peace. Thus, one of his aims was to secure these two sorts of happiness by maintaining a “secondary or intermediate” state between the two primary states of being. The main reasons why he believed this to hold true were due to the fact that, for example, those who were born into poverty, were often unable to satisfy their desire for happiness and were forced to live in a state in which they had no control over their circumstances. On the other hand, anyone who was born with wealth (as is the case with most of us today) could choose to end up in both a primary state and a secondary state. Therefore, it was important to Locke that different individuals have the same sort of freedom within their respective primary and secondary states so that they could feel confident about what they were doing. He believed, therefore, that every person had to possess a distinct set combination of these qualities in order to fully enjoy the benefits of their existence. For example: If a man is born poor, then he will have to work hard to earn his living. However, when he has done this, once he is able, let us say, to support himself, without begging, until he finds a better opportunity, instead of becoming a slave, but rather finding a job where you are earning enough to survive, you will be given a second chance, because your old habits will return to you again. (A Treatises of Government, Book I Chapter 4) Here, we see that Locke believes that not only is there a benefit in having a strong sense self-worth, as discussed in previous lecture, although we also have an individual who can gain this sense after a specific period of time. We also see here that it is important that we have some measure of self confidence before we begin to question our own moral character, especially since Locke felt that any society with this sort offamilies would not flourish. Our modern day society is a result of the influence of Locke's beliefs in the 1600's. Many people today are still trying to re-establish a form of government that promotes self worth and respect."
George Schlesinger and Pascal's Wager George Schlesinger addresses several major objections to Pascal's famous wager.," In this episode, we address the two most frequently cited arguments against the wagering idea. The first one (about a human's propensity to fall in love with his wife's future husband) also applies to other animals. We argue that it has been widely accepted among those who claim to know the truth of Pascal. However, the second objection (that a man's ability to predict the results of his bets can be used to prove that he is calculating with the same objectivity as a mathematician) is simply incorrect. And if it is wrong, then it does not follow from the fact that mathematicians have a subjective interest in predicting the future but men do not. Finally, let me suggest an interesting alternative to these two objections that I hope will encourage you to think more carefully about the philosophical issues raised by these debates. It concerns the so-called ""impersonal"" account of mathematical logic: the view that only the objects of mathematics are ""private"" in respect to the mathematical process. This view is defended by David Hilbert in his celebrated book Logical Investigations. According to this view, arithmetic cannot be understood unless it becomes the expression of a concern which belongs to no one person, but rather to everyone of us. Just as the mathematics of geometry is the scientific expression, or formal language, of the deepest emotional, mental, and intellectual experience, so the philosophy of arithmetic should be a scientific abstraction from our ordinary lives. If this is correct, it may be helpful in addressing the objections mentioned above. As a starting point for any argument, I will briefly summarize a few main ideas behind this ""personal account"" of logic. First, my aim is to show that the claims made by some of these opponents are mistaken. Second, they overlook the important point that, since mathematical proofs are true only within the limits of their applicability, there is no good reason to restrict them to particular mathematical statements. Consequently, such arguments are irrelevant for understanding the kind of philosophical questions that they are trying to address. Third, even if the proponents of this personal account did not consider themselves bound to be indifferent to their opponent's views, their refusal to admit that their position is mistaken leads them astray into the horns of an obvious paradox. For, if their personal beliefs about mathematics were correct but their real attitude towards the object of its study were different, each of them would be able to give a convincing account both of why his viewpoint is preferable to theirs and of how it could be improved. Thus, although we should never assume that our opponent is objectively better than we are, when we try to understand what he really thinks we need to start by asking ourselves whether his position might be acceptable under the conditions of our own day. Our answer must always be negative. Therefore, because we all agree that mathematical arguments must be based on the principle of parsimony, whatever our personal views about matters of theory, our best strategy is probably to adopt the following attitude: I reject your personal preference for one set of assumptions over another; I hold to my personal view about what ought to count as mathematics, without allowing that this might prevent me from accepting your preference. (In fact, this strategy can sometimes be quite fruitful and can make it easier to move between opposing positions.) To avoid the temptation to play games, though, at this point I should like to mention a slightly different approach: while I am arguing that my position does indeed fail to satisfy the standard criteria for success in philosophical disputes, nor does it offer much help in answering the question of what I think is best. But this misses the point of playing games. Although I do believe that there are good reasons to resist your views on mathematics and that very likely there aren't any, nonetheless I don't see why we shouldn't entertain the possibility that we might actually be wrong about everything. Philosophers who want to argue in favor of certain conclusions about rationality and ethics are naturally suspicious of being ruled out of court because they happen to belong to certain groups. By the way, speaking of ""the group"", I meant the group whose members consistently side with their opponents in the arguments described above, regardless of whether they fully believe in their respective views.

"Aristotle on Friendship In Books VIII and IX of the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle"," describes three types of friendship: friendship that is “the greatest of good”, ‘friendship to be endured with pleasure’, and „friendships that are beneficial for one another‟. The third type of friendships, those that ‚are beneficent for both parties‛, are the most noble. (Book VIII:5) Friendship is the basis of our relationships with others, although it can be a source of trouble if it does not lead to harmony. In order to understand what it is that makes friendship so special, it will help to know the history of human relationship. Aristotle writes in Book VIII of his NichOMacheon Ethics: ‹The life of a man is different from other animals, because he is capable of enduring pain, suffering, death and all kinds of hardship; but he also is like other creatures who share the same food, drink, clothing, shelter and sheltering; each has his own place in the natural world; there is something about him that distinguishes him from others› (EN III.2:3-5). Human life, especially in its earlier stages, often seems very lonely and insecure. This, along with the fact that it lacks the kind of social connections that allow for the formation of strong, stable bonds between individuals, leads us to question whether any of us truly has a ‌friend‎. A number of people have experienced the isolation that comes with being young when they are left alone to play with toys, watch television, or go to parties. We can say without exaggeration that this is one of life's greatest gifts. It is only through this sense of security and belonging that we can endure hardship and adversity. But this feeling of safety, when taken away, can make us very vulnerable to the bad consequences of certain kinds behaviour. As long as we are still able to function, we should keep in mind that our happiness and our ability to overcome situations may suffer. Although the Greeks did not generally speak of  love in relation to friendship, they did recognize two different kinds: physical affection and political friendship (Bibliography). For example, Democritus says (′On Friendship‴:9) :  Truly, you cannot have friendship without affection• (p. 8). Friendship, in itself, does little to improve our lives, nor does it bring us a sense anything of satisfaction. Therefore, Aristophanes' Oedipus Tyrannus was based on the idea that friendships are unimportant, though some friendships provide some degree of pleasure to their participants (Oed. Tyr. p. 55). Nevertheless, the truth is, that the way in which a friendship develops, as well as the level of happiness attained, depend entirely upon the specific circumstances in each person's life. However, Plato's treatment of love is clear and convincing. Love is an important element of true friendship. Plato discusses love in relation more to physical rather than emotional union. Emotional and physical intimacy seem to exist side by side, but love allows the two to merge into a greater whole. For Plato, love can best be defined as a form of attachment that involves a strong bond between the beloved and the one loved. Platonic love therefore extends to feelings of loyalty, care and affection. Having described love as an attachment of this sort, he goes on to elaborate on what love means. Our attachment to someone is not merely a physical feeling, such as 'loving', but rather an emotion that arises from a relationship of mutual benefit and respect. Every successful relationship has at least one quality that contributes to this relationship being successful: it has been developed through mutual respect, shared interests and a shared sense how much each wants the other to grow. Finally, let me quote this part of Plato‡s description of genuine friendship by Plutarch (Plut. Rhet. 491b) ‡: [Love] is a strange thing, for it takes place between persons in spite of their enemies, not because of them. And yet, since it appears from what they say, no friend could be opposed to a lover.‖ Love, then, is neither an affective sensation, like love, which arises spontaneously, out of an effort to connect with someone, whose connection is brought about by a particular event, chance or circumstance, quite apart from the nature of these events. Nor is it a feeling that occurs because two persons have chosen to associate together. Rather, [love] depends on a fundamental difference between two beings, on their being joined to each other and separated from each

of us. If we think of it in terms of some positive feeling arising from two people living together, having a common desire, purpose and intention, sharing a similar outlook on life and behaving as if they were friends, this would be"
"Explaining Locke's Primary and Secondary Qualities In his Essay Concerning Human Understanding 1, John Locke makes"," two contributions to our understanding of the nature of mind: he takes mind to be a faculty which arises from a substance that is capable of thinking, and in this capacity he differentiates it into its two primary qualities, intellective or rational and affective. In Book I of his treatise, Locke argues that all mental states are acts of thought because they are the product of a compound object whose properties are such that it can undergo the actions of its constituent objects. The first part of Locke s argument attempts to prove that every mental state is the act of an object, but the second section of book I introduces the concept of substance as a necessary component of being-in-the-world. This establishes how a mental thing, for example, a mind, can be composed of some combination of matter and ideas, i.e., a brain. 2 As a matter of fact, the philosophical basis of this claim is Locke himself since it is clear that Locke will use this principle when arguing that mind is a property of substances. So, although Locke uses the same term, substance, to refer to the composite of body and mind (as he does in Book III), he will do so using the term mind itself rather than a composite form. Although Locke mentions many forms of minds in his writings, especially in terms of mathematical reasoning, he still focuses on the fundamental psychological characteristics of each type. For example: In the fourth book of Treatise of Government, vol. I, Chapter 11, An Abstract Introduction to Philosophy, Book VIII, On Ideas, ""We have not, therefore, any occasion to consider the Idea of Mind"" (11:4). In Locke l8s own writings on mind there is much discussion about the origin of ideas and how they arise; but he tends to only mention the existence of these ideas when referring to mental things. Many of us have heard of philosophers who claim to know the mind of God, or who assert that God has an understanding which is immanent in the universe, etc. But Locke never makes reference to these beliefs in any of their detail, nor does he discuss how God could know what people know. What Locke says on this point is that, insofar as people have ideas of things, they should be able to tell that they know something about those things even though we cannot see them directly. Therefore, because we think of beings, we should also think that we know them. 3 This allows Locke to argue that ideas are grounded in material objects like bodies. When I reflect on what I know, my mind goes out to certain ideas which I have formed in my imagination. These ideas go out of me and come into the world. If these things are true, I should have these impressions of them in myself, with which they constitute me, as soon as they happen to me. (3:1-5) Locke continues to elaborate on his claim that the objects of our experience are not merely images, sensations, ideas or ideas' products, instead, these objects are our very own ideas. Thus, when we make mental acts, our mind produces thoughts which are independent of anything else. Our thoughts, by virtue of having an external object through which to move, are thus separate from our bodies and can travel to other objects without needing to leave our body. Locke asserts that our minds create ideas in three different ways: 1) by means of physical actions; 2) through the workings of reason; and 3) via the operation of intellect. 4 In order to understand Locke 1s claim about how mental objects produce ideas we must first understand what he means by physical action. Physical action is an act carried out by a body which produces the effect of movement in space and time. 5 Physical actions are those which occur independently of any body involved in producing them, e.g., walking, running, jumping, throwing up, hitting someone, rolling down a hill, crying, laughing, singing, sniffing, eating, drinking, taking a bath, sleeping, playing music, reading a book, doing mathematics, speaking, listening, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking and so forth. 6 All physical acts are performed by bodies acting alone. 7 Because physical laws describe the way bodies act, scientists and engineers work within the confines of physics. 8 The physical world is divided into parts - sometimes called macroscopic - and microscopic - usually referred to as microscopics 9 - that obey the laws of mechanics. 10 These two divisions are meant to distinguish between the two kinds of bodies - animate andanimate - but they serve the functions of creating a hierarchy of types. 11 The division of visible matter into macro and micro requires us to posit a strict boundary between human and nonhuman creatures. 12 This distinction is important for understanding why we need the notion of personhood, since the human body is defined strictly as consisting of flesh,"
EXAMINING SOCRATES' DESIRE THEORY In the Meno Socrates argues that no one desires what," they do not desire; i.e., their desire is not in themselves a desire (eidos). If, for example, we desire to be happy we would not need to have a specific desire for happiness. The Stoics, on the other hand, claim that only what one wants is in itself a genuine desire. This leads them to posit two different notions of desire: desideratum and desire proper. In order to understand this, let me examine Desiderata (8.26a–9) and its doctrine of good desire using the same material as Men's discussion of Desires (3.6b–8). I will proceed with the following points from Desidersiota. 1. Good desire cannot be a distinct kind or dimension of being. [The Stoic thesis] does not say that goodness is simply a virtue or a disposition. It denies that it is a property or characteristic. For, though good is characterized by virtue, it can never be truly a good without having some degree of goodness already present in oneself. Neither does it say anything about what it means to desire something. (DESIDERATUS 8.25b) Desire proper is the desire of which there are two kinds: desire-for-what-you-want and wish-which-You-desire. Desire-as-something-I-do-not-have is at once a kind of passion or emotion (desiromai) that is naturally present and a form of thinking (epitein). The first part of the thesis is that desire has no identity in its own terms. 2. Desiring what you do want is desire improper because it does things for you that you could not do for yourself. Nor does desire properly include desire since it involves doing something else. So there is no difference between desire and ""the desire so directed toward the good"" (1.2). Both are desire according to the Stoically conceived concept. 3. If desire were a natural kind, then the theory would be perfectly true. But desire, being natural, is only a case of a genus (genus) rather than a species. And it seems that our actual desires are quite varied. 4. To desire what we do must necessarily be to act in accordance with this desire—and not merely in response to another desire or passion. 5. There is thus no reason to expect that either the wish or the action should be desirable. 6. Therefore, although we are naturally disposed to seek what others want, such desires can neither serve as a motive to action nor be necessary conditions for any action. 7. Since desire involves action, the Theory cannot describe the way in which our natural desire works. Consequently, when we act, therefore, those actions are performed in spite of these natural desires. 8.-10. Just as desire imperatively demands the fulfilment of its aim, so the urge imperiously demands that its object should appear in the midst of us. 12. Suppose that someone asks you to go into town and come back. You would gladly go and do as you were bid, but you would realize that your desire had not been fulfilled. Would you go? Would going out be preferable to staying at home? Or would you decide to stay at your home and think of ways to entertain yourself? What if you discover that the person whom you love has actually gone out to meet someone else? Where would your sense of pleasure lie? With the objects of your satisfaction? Of course, you cannot follow your natural inclination in all cases. Still, if we deny that we possess a capacity for natural goodness, how can it be that every desire we have is unnatural? It seems to me that there really is nothing in our nature that makes us desire the truth. 13. Whatever the origin of our desire may be, wherever it may originate, I think that most of it would remain natural. Not the least of my own wishes is to find out who my friends are. My desire often forces me to visit certain places. Every time I go, my desire tells me why I should stay.14 Why should I not take pleasure in seeing what I do see? Why shouldn't I be interested in what happens there? But I know that I am not fulfilling a pure desire like other people. I feel no excitement in visiting some city and discovering what is happening there, no thrill of curiosity.15 I have no desire whatever to investigate the laws of physics or to see the stars.16 My only desire consists in finding out what happened.17 Yet, since I enjoy the experience of visiting new places and seeing new things, this is something I can do.18 -20. Finally, now that he has said that many desires spring from natural inclinations, Plato goes on to point out that they are not the only ones."

In it the philosopher discusses the nature of human society. Although the topic is not the most significant one, it is the beginning of a long series of dialogs which take place in different cities throughout the ancient world.

Introduction



"
"Gilbert and Directions of Correspondence In this short paper, I will discuss J. David Velleman's"," claim that, in the course of his research, he came across a set of correspondence between Boccaccio and a man named Guglielmo da Forlì. This correspondence, which Vellmann claims to be a precursor to Petrarch's Le Credite (or The Book of the City of Ladies) reveals something about the way in which Bocaccius' poetry functions in its original setting. The correspondence also serves as a window into BOCACCIOS literary production: it reveals the manner in both which he produces his texts, and in what ways he appropriates and transforms the forms of writing that he has seen in Florence. Ultimately, the correspondence illustrates how the form of Renaissance literature, with its diverse modes of expression, can be understood through its literary practice, for example, how, when writing about figures of a religious order like Pope Pius V, who enjoyed the support of an immense number of courtiers, writers like Boca should not forget that the poet must always find those who would help him to write his text. Although I have chosen to analyze this correspondence in relation to Boffo, Velsant and Valla, my analysis of this piece of literary history is not at all a straightforward one. In order to understand the relationship between the two Boci, one must read the poem in terms of its wider context. Vellsamont's theory suggests that we should study Boco's poems in their original context before analyzing their literary value. But such an approach, however tempting, risks ignoring the ways in each individual case in question that give us a sense of what it is that makes each work unique. As I hope to show here, this is particularly true of Vallas' letter, because in spite of being situated within a larger literary context, it offers us insight into the kind of creativity that characterizes the life of Italian Renaissance humanists. Finally, although I do think this essay is ultimately a study of Bollo, Krasemann, Tasso and Ugo Foscolo, there are other contemporary scholars who might profitably consider the letters from Bowers and Tassoni, especially those of Pietro della Valle, whose literary-critical approach is much closer to Vella's than any of these earlier scholars. I end on a note of caution, suggesting that reading this literature in isolation, without looking at it in context or considering its significance for other Renaissance studies, might be dangerous. It seems likely to me, though, that it will never be completely out of reach. 2. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST POPE VI

Bocacius had written his Ars Amatoria, now first published by Bibliothèque Universelle in Paris in 1532, about Pope Julius III. Already by the beginning of 1520, Pope Leo X was already making the case for his choice of candidate for papacy, Julius' successor. Leo's predecessor had been Julius, a contemporary and close friend of Lorenzo de Medici. Julius was also an advocate of freedom for Italy, against what the Venetians had done to their former master and colleague. Both of them were fiercely opposed to foreign interference in Italian affairs, but their policy was very much in harmony with the Holy See. Between 1502 and 1506, Leo was pope, taking over from Julius.
13
A PROPER REPRESENTATION OF A NEW ERA
With Leo XIII's death in 1509, Italy was left without a leader, since none of Leo x's successors were as powerful as Julius himself. His successors in Rome, those two cardinals he had appointed, were the same ones who had dismissed Julius in 1494. Throughout the 1510s, Venice was able to assert itself as the pre-eminent power in Italy. And in January 1514, as soon as Leo died, Veneto was given the papal name and its representative in office. Clement VII was the fourth pope after St Peter to come to power from a region that had never before had a pope. He brought to Rome the most powerful forces of Europe. After Clement, no pope held a greater power than John XXIII, whom we will meet again in our final chapter. John was a strong advocate for the rights of Italy in his position as pontiff. However, despite his power, John had no real control over the temporal power of Venice. Indeed, his rule was often questioned. There was much talk of how much power he was lacking in governing Italy due to his lack of control of Veneta's power. Therefore, someone had to occupy the seat of power and this was usually thought to belong to Pope John. Yet, anyone who saw the long line of pope's in charge knew that they were not in control, nor were they truly in possession of their own authority"
"Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant attempts to prove that our"," sensory faculties are the only means by which we gain knowledge about things. This is the point of a passage from a later argument he wrote to support his claim: I have not succeeded in showing that I can know any object on the basis of its form alone. In order to know some object one must also know its matter; for example, I know the forms of an object through my sensibility. But how does a man who knows nothing about these forms acquire knowledge of the matter of these objects? By the power of his reason. The forms therefore are known to me as a consequence of my cognition of their matter. (A138/B147) Kant's claim is that there is a necessary connection between the form and the thing it shapes, and that through this connection, or transcendental deduction, one can find out the essence of all things, namely their materiality. We can see why the transcendentally deduced essence would be the same for each object, since it is simply the way in which the object is characterized by its particular matter, i.e., by the specific ""form"" that makes up its different properties. To know what it consists in, we need only know it through its sensible properties, just as the laws of physics tell us that every particle has mass and length. Our understanding of objects, then, is like our sense organs, which function by means of certain kinds of mathematical laws. Just as our sensation of color allows us to describe a particular triangle in terms of three different colors, so the analytic understanding allows Kant to characterize the objects of scientific inquiry in the manner we do. For example: Kant states that a mathematician needs only two parameters, such as number and magnitude, to discover the nature of anything: ""In addition, when I determine the magnitude of something, no other term comes into play, nor is there any other instrument available in order that [I may] measure the space occupied by it. [Although] the limits of possibility remain."" A142/A146 (italics mine). Kant suggests that it will take a human intellect to figure out how a triangle is formed and what its dimensions are. How is this achieved? Through the senses. Not the sense of touch, but the experience of hearing, sight, smell, taste, feel, etc. These are all ways of perceiving the world. And they all allow us access to the essences of things precisely through the application of mathematics. Therefore, the mathematician, through his mathematical knowledge, can make sense out of appearances. All of which leads us back to Kantianism. More generally, it offers a plausible explanation of why we are able to understand the natural world using mathematics and logical reasoning. 2.2 The Critique of Pure Reason As far as Kant is concerned, mathematics, logic and epistemology are together the most fundamental philosophical disciplines. Although he believes that the two subjects cannot be understood separately, he nevertheless admits that they share certain common features. Kant doesn't explicitly refer to these common characteristics, because he realizes that this would undermine his thesis. Instead, his discussion focuses on two very distinct and independent concerns: the critique of pure reason and its consequences for episteme. It seems that Kant thinks that, although both subjects have been developed separately throughout history, they still have a common foundation. At the core of Kant s critique is his belief that rational thought involves the act of thinking, not the merely passive reception of information. Any attempt to conceive a pure form of reason would collapse the distinction between reason-as-form and reason itself, rendering reason a formless thing. Hence, pure reasons are properly understood as pure concepts. Given this, what can we really know? The very act involved in determining what is truly rational is at the heart of everything we think and ask of another. If pure philosophy is founded on pure conceptiN Kant gives a definition of concepts similar to this one, though here, instead of referring to categories, Kants uses language more akin to a scientific term: concepts are such that we can state with certainty whether they are true or false. Every concept ultimately consists of several concepts, each of whose elements is contained in another concept. Here Kant uses the expression ""extensive concept,"" which he calls a concept of extension. A concept is extended if it can be shown that its components can independently serve as independent concepts and, therefore, are derived from one another rather than being identical with them. Thus, for instance, a category is defined as having the property of being a member of some class. Many of our concepts relate to each other in such a way that given a set of premises, anyone could rationally derive the truth of any of them without reference to any others. However, while this is true for any concept, often we have more than one concept that is capable of independently serving as part of yet"
"Music and Negative Emotion In his essay, Music and Negative Emotion, Jerrold Levinson attempts"," to reconcile what he terms a ""problematic"" relationship between music and negative emotion. Levison describes three kinds of music-related negative emotional response: emotional arousal (e.g., a thrill, an earthquake, a feeling of terror), emotional avoidance (i.e., escape, avoidance of pain or embarrassment), and positive emotional experience (the experience of happiness, enjoyment). In examining these types of negative emotions, Levson is particularly critical of the way music is often regarded as a means by which one experiences negative affect. The first type of response, he argues, is actually a form of arousal that results from music's association with the experience; it is something one wants, not something that occurs naturally in response to music itself. This type involves no fear, no anxiety, nor does it result from a sense of separation from the music. Although the second type - namely, the kind of avoidance that involves negative physiological changes - is typically considered the most disturbing, it may also have a more pleasant counterpart. For example, when one hears a trumpet note, one may become flooded with pleasure for several moments following its playing. In this case, there is no discomfort, because the pleasure is generated by the association of a specific sound with a pleasant feeling. Finally, for individuals with high negative moods, music may trigger negative feelings of disgust, sadness, and anger, but these emotions are only elicited through exposure to certain kinds sounds. These different types do not occur naturally together. Therefore, although it seems that music can elicit negative responses, those responses are not in any way innate. Because Levionts' view of musical pleasure contains a strong emphasis on psychological involvement, such responses seem natural to some, especially those who experience negative states. Moreover, since Levinsons uses a scientific account of emotion, his position is open to criticism. What might be the basis of Levinst's claim that our experience has nothing to do with our biological inheritance? More generally, what might we learn from Levionses' interpretation of past evolutionary history?"
"The Chinese Room, and What It Takes to Build a Mind In the past several decades, computer scientists and artificial intelligence"," researchers have built impressive neural network architectures that can solve complex problems for massive amounts of data. The research has had a range of applications in domains such as image recognition and speech enhancement, but its biggest impact is yet to come: It has ushered in a new kind of “superintelligence.”

Scientists are now using neural networks to build machines that are smarter than us — with the potential to be far more powerful than we are. In fact, one researcher compared the recent successes of AI research to being born with only the most rudimentary brain. ‘He could remember everything you say,’ says Svante Pääbo, who helped pioneer machine learning. He is the director of the New York-based Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, where he leads an effort to understand how the human brain works.
A few days after that, Péter Szilágyi, another pioneer in AI, was discussing how much progress had been made by researchers in both fields. His reply was that they should study the same thing, which was very easy to agree with, given that AI researchers typically work in disciplines that overlap with neuroscience. (For example, when AI scientists like DeepMind were designing their algorithms in the 1990s, they relied on techniques from biology, such NMR spectroscopy.)
But it was only just recently that this convergence began to accelerate. This is a common phenomenon among people who work with big data and big projects. For example:
1. Machine learning researchers used to think of a neural net as a black box that worked without knowing anything about the way the brain operates. When I spoke with Deepmind‘s chief neuroscientist at the beginning of 2018, Ralf Tafler, he said that his team had built a ’black box‖that gave him insights into the workings of his brain – and that it could take any number of approaches to understanding the underlying mechanism. Now, however, Taffler says that these approaches need to start thinking of themselves as building blocks of neural nets. As they learn more about each other, the black boxes will get smarter, able to communicate with each individual part of them. So while the neural architecture might be a mystery to the researchers, it will all eventually be understood if the teams can combine their various insights. [The Telegraph]
2. Many of today‟s top scientists use some form of mathematical modeling to describe the biological processes they want to study. But there is little agreement about what makes up these models. It is increasingly common for scientists to talk about a model as if it were a blueprint, rather than a working tool. Just as the „blackbox‡ model used in #1 is now seen as an actual blueprint for understanding neurons, so the ones used by #2 are becoming more akin to actual functioning models, not just mathematical descriptions. Still, though, many scientists argue that there are still important gaps in our understanding of how these systems work, especially in terms of mechanisms that underlie the ability of these networks of neurons to perform complex tasks. And although we still do not know the fundamental rules of operation for these neural structures, we do know a lot about how they behave and why they work the ways they do. Brain research, for example…
3. Neuroscientists have been using mathematical models to make sense of behavior of nerve cells over centuries, since Aristotle described the nervous system in his 13th century biology treatise De generatione et destructione animalium. Mathematical models became even more important during the last few decades because they allowed for a greater level of understanding. Early attempts to characterize the function of single neurons produced models that were often highly simplified. More recent models allow for much greater complexity, capturing the connections between different parts of neuronal structure. A model of interneuronal communication is one example of an emerging field of research; another is modelling the organization of large-scale neuronal assemblies. Both of those fields have led to greatly improved understanding, including developing algorithms that allow computers to recognize patterns in images and identify specific objects or events within them, as well as creating sophisticated artificial neural ‐t networks that mimic the functions of human brains. Other research focuses on understanding how information flows between neurons and how neurons connect to each others‚ providing a wealth of clues about brain structure and function. There has also been much interest in determining how different areas of cortex work together, whose interactions shape the experience of memory and cognition. Ultimately, all of this research can be used simply to test models and ideas, suggesting new lines of investigation that will yield better understanding and prediction. One such line of inquiry is to determine whether certain brain regions are associated with certain types of memories or with different types. Researchers have tried to detect links between areas that fire together in different moments of time,"
"Two Distinctions in Kant In his Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant makes two"," significant generalizations regarding the conditions for justification: first, that justification is possible only if the subject is capable of a free and adequate reason-for-giver; second, to be justified, the agent must also possess the faculty of willing. Both of these propositions are quite general. The first can be understood as a statement about what it means for someone to have a genuine, autonomous reason to fall short of being justified. To be able to know whether I have an adequate rational response to my reasons for choosing p, I do not need to analyze them directly, since I can merely consider whether they are compatible with my (subjective) reasons. In other words, because I am capable, on my own knowledge, of thinking how much it will cost me to adopt p when I know I should not, my consideration of whether p is sufficient to justify me, regardless of its content, is a pure form of self-knowledge. This does not entail, however, there being no such thing as my right to choose whatever I want. Someone who knows she should reject her evidence for p's falsity may prefer to believe she has an independent reason for rejecting it. But such a preference would not constitute justification. Rather, it would be a form or a stage of justification, something I could choose to undergo once I had grasped the full significance of my evidence against p. Suppose I were to make that choice, which would amount to simply taking an option away from a perfectly good alternative. There would remain no grounds for denying the existence of an absolute end—no grounds at all for holding that I lack the basis for any justification whatsoever. That is why, Kant argues, such grounds do exist, though they always come into play only when there is an evident failure to satisfy some necessary condition of possibility. Therefore, if it is clear that there cannot be justification for one to do something against one's reason, then it cannot equally be concluded that one cannot also be condemned to doing something contrary to one s reason. Thus, according to Kant, insofar as there are reasons that are sufficiently compelling for us to accept their existence, they can never be overcome by any reasonless action we might undertake. Given this, although it may seem that justificatory principles are somehow more difficult to discover than moral principles, this is not so. Simply stated, we can know our own moral status without knowing that we are deserving of any rights or responsibilities. We can thereby know that it makes no sense to demand our neighbor do anything against his reason except suffer the consequences of his actions.

But even if this argument is sound, questions remain as to whether Kant's generalization can really be extended to the level of the particular case. Kant thinks that every rational agent is aware of some kind of legitimate freedom, namely, freedom from irrationality or blind faith. However, he thinks it wrong to conceive of rationality as completely free, as if we could imagine ourselves in a position where we were not bound by some external reason whose operation we see but do nothing to resist. Since, for example, someone is justified to hold on to some material objects if those objects are necessary in order to support him, anyone who possesses the capacity to put these objects aside would clearly be deprived of their value. If, therefore, having an actual reason not to deviate from one course is actually a necessary aspect of human freedom itself, isn't it also true that everyone who is genuinely rational has the same freedom? What happens when we think of ourselves as having the freedom to deliberate endlessly over a plan of action, or to decide upon a course of behavior, especially in matters of life and death? In these situations, you can hardly maintain that your freedom is completely freed of coercion, given that you have the option of remaining silent or of deciding to abandon your plan. Certainly, when you go to bed, sleep, eat, and drink, others are still trying to convince you to act otherwise, but you are not in any way being controlled by them. Nor are you constrained by the opinions of others. Yet, in spite of all this freedom we have, people are often forced to behave in ways they would otherwise refrain from. So if you think that the claim that all rational agents have some degree of freedom before making a choice is ridiculous, take a look at some of Kant s own examples. For example: Why should someone continue to drink alcohol if he believes there will be negative side effects? Why would someone ever give up a career in medicine if they believe it requires a certain amount of sacrifice? And why would a physician allow his patients to die if, alone among them, nobody believes the disease is curable? When the physician says that, ""We cannot save everyone, so we must try to cure as many as possible,"" isn t it a sign of madness that he is deceiving himself and others? The real question"
"Grice's Analysis of Metaphor and Irony In his Logic and Conversation 1, H. P. Grice describes"," how metaphors can convey complex messages in a straightforward manner, whereas he regards metaphors as 'the least adequate' (Griffiths 1974, 163). There are different kinds of metaphor, with the most basic being that involving the similarity of two ideas or terms, for example:

(1) I have a hat which is like a crown.
  (2) A crown is round. The hat is square. (3) If a man had a tall hat, he would look very much like King George VI.

 We can represent the first two items of the above pairs by: (1)-(2), and the third item by (4): (A) = (B) → (C)
I do not think we should take the idea of a high hat seriously at all. Our thoughts about (a) may be based on (b) and (c) rather than (d). The second item of (5) does not involve the resemblance of hats – it involves the same thing but in different form. Therefore, although we can say that (e) could be understood as a sentence such as (6):
 (7) The moon is shining. [lit., shine]
this sentence is not clear. We would not normally say ""The moon looks shiny.""
It is only if you consider the expression ""shining"" to be a property of some object that is different from a natural phenomenon. For example, the light of an incandescent lamp is sometimes said to shine, when in fact it does nothing else. Similarly, one says ""There is something shining on the floor""; this is a figurative use of ""shine"".
But it is also possible that we make use here of certain common meanings of verbs, such that the two sets of ideas are equivalent, and that our sentence (""The sky is glittering,"" ""If you're shining, you must be happy."") can be taken as expressing an analogous meaning. This is the case with ""glint."" We use ""gleam"" in such cases instead of saying ""smell"" (as is usually done), because ""stirring"" has a more conventional meaning in English. But ""look"" can also be used in this way, as in ""Hair is glinting."" Now the phrase ""sailing into the sunset"" seems to express a similar thought. In fact, it could also mean ""looking glamorous."" But again we would normally use other verbal forms, because they are commonly used. Note that ""ship"" is never used, since it has no obvious equivalent in any of these situations. So, we see that there is no way of knowing which set of expressions we really meant. Neither the metaphor nor the literal interpretation is satisfactory. Thus, Griseldis denies that metaphor has truth-conditional force. He considers that it may merely convey an interesting image, or may tell us something about the speaker's attitude to the objects mentioned, but he cannot be held responsible for the truth of its meaning; nor can it be shown that any statement which expresses it will ever be literally true (ibid., 199).
Some further considerations are necessary, though, before we try to understand what it means to say: ""if it were shining"", or ""it is shiny"", etc. It might be helpful to point out that, in both these cases, ""brighter"" and ""more brilliant"" are non-verbal expressions of quality, not of quantity. They are not words of actual magnitude. And they do seem to convey something of value about what they refer to. ""Bright"" may mean bright, pleasant, clean, etc., but it can equally mean brighter, brighter..., i.e. brighter brightness. Or, perhaps, just more brilliant. There is probably a middle ground between the extremes: perhaps something more or less bright. That is, maybe the word ""bright"" could mean something else entirely. One could imagine a case in which ""butterfly"" might actually mean butterfly, instead, while ""sunflower"" would be correct. Certainly, then, there are shades of meaning here, each of which may give us a sense of something nice about them. Of course, this raises another question: is there a single meaning which all these uses of words serve? It seems that if there were, they would all be acceptable, even if none of them seemed to correspond to anything real. Although it sounds odd, I suspect that this may not be so. Many of us are aware of ways in everyday language of referring to qualities without mentioning quantities. Someone who talks about an ""excellent"" meal, someone who describes a person as having an excellent job, a perfectly good car, an even-tempered person, anyone who writes well, who knows exactly what a dog is"
The Morality of Commonality and Agent Specific Restrictions Act-utilitarianism holds that an act is right if and only," if it maximizes its effect, because in such cases the act's effect is the same for each person involved in the action. In other words, since the effect of an action is defined by its causes, and since agents do not differ in their sensitivity to reasons, actions are right just in case they maximize the ends of their individuals. The act maximizing its outcome is called a maximizing act, or a common utility act. Common utility acts are thus utilitarian actions; they are those that are most worth having (because they maximize the collective end). However, not all actions maximizing their collective ends are utilitarian. This is one of the most serious objections against utilitarianism. For example, no actions maximizing their effects will be considered right when they violate some principle of social utility. (See ""Some Philosophical Issues about Utilitarian Aims"")

This is a topic often discussed in philosophical texts, especially in ethics. Many authors discuss whether there are any circumstances in which an agent may not have a duty to maximise its good. Some authors go so far as to declare that it is wrong for any agent to have moral duty towards anyone else. Others argue that agents might be obligated to behave in certain ways because they deserve to be treated as having certain sorts of good standing within society. Both views are controversial.
Other authors who defend utilitarian thinking on this issue are:
Eckersley and Clark (1961)
Cannon and Tullock (1963) 
Lomasko, R.M. and Hales (1973)

"
THE MEANING OF WRONG What is meant when we call an act wrong? I," have not the foggiest what you were saying about those two guys. In fact, I know that it was just a rumor. The thing to do is get back to me and let me know what they say.

It is never a mistake to put the blame where it belongs. A man who can make good use of his own body while a man like George Washington can go into battle in a shirt unbuttoned all the way up has every right to wear a coat even when he is covered in blood. We should always think of those who come to this country as the only people who are the most innocent. I hope your friend is able to be healed. Not that I ever expect anything from him. This is the one thing he will never have. You can hold him down with his big arms if you wish. But you can never hold a body high. It will fall with the weight of its own weight. He may have a lot of life in him yet, but he still has nothing over his shoulders. Let me ask you a question, Mrs. Stott: If you could live anywhere on the face of the earth, where would you go? It is impossible to know. Every day is different. If I could choose a place, it would be a little country somewhere in the South Sea Islands. They are a long way away from here, though, and I doubt if there are any such places. When I am dead, my body will be lying in its coffin in some old churchyard in France. And I will take my Bible with me, so that if I die, no one can say I did not die the death of a Christian. Would you like to see my tomb? Would it be wise for you to visit it? The day will come when I can travel to the place where I first laid my head. Oh, you would not believe how much I loved this place. Nothing in this world could make me wish to leave it. All I want is to live and die here. Our Lord has said many times that he does not desire any reward for his disciples except that they should love their father and mother. So I too shall love you, because I owe you my life. (See The Life and Miracles of Joseph Smith, Jun., in Volume 1 of vol. 1, ""Inquiry into The Teachings of Jesus and His Revelations,"" pp. 94-95)

TO WITHDRAW OR RETIRE
My family and myself have chosen to withdraw from church service. My reason for doing so is that our children now understand what it means to go to church and learn about our Savior and to worship him and be taught to fear him rather than obey the command to love him alone. More and more I feel that we are making ourselves into people of little value. Therefore, we must withdraw until our minds and our consciences are clean and cleansed. Many of us feel tempted to continue attending church, especially in our old age. That is a temptation that is easily overcome. Just as a doctor cannot keep a patient forever under his care, nor can we keep anyone else under our rule. Fortunately, God has provided a way out of this predicament. Through the Holy Ghost, the Father has given me the gift of apostleship, which means that through my efforts, others can become Christians. By the power of Christ I now ordain that every person whom God gives unto me will receive the same baptism and receive salvation through him; and that faith in Jesus Christ is sufficient to qualify each one to receive it, whether or not he believes the gospel. There is one other way in which we can fulfill the will of God, namely through prayer. No one becomes saved by his merits, or through any human means. Salvation is by the grace of our Lord and Savior JesusChrist, obtained through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Amen. [2nd edition, pg. 494]
LAST CALL IN PAVILLONBURG
I have been in Pavanillonburg, Ga., recently, visiting with my daughter Ruth, her husband Tom, their three children and my grandson, Terence, since my arrival. As I write this, Ruth and Terenus are getting ready"
"The Cartesian Circle Often referred to as the Cartesian Circle, Descartes presents a"," mechanical and chemical description of a circle that would be impossible in any other system, such as Euclidian or cylindrical geometry. The Cartian circle is the plane composed of four straight lines, one from each point on the circle. This is shown below. Note that it is only a planar surface, not a solid.

A Carte's Description of the Circle
Descartes' description starts with the fact that the two axes of an axis-ratio diagram lie on a plane. He then defines the locus of points on this plane that are equidistant from these two vertical lines as a line through the origin. (See also: Line of Equidistance). For any point A, let the distance AB from the point at which all points along the curve B lie is called the ""intercept"". For example, the intercept of (A,C) = 2. Suppose that A is at the left-hand side of C, and that B lies at its right-ward end. Then the intersection of AB and AC is (B,A) + (C,B) – (0,0) : the segment AB intersects the line AC, but does not pass through A. We define the chord AB as being equal to this segment. Therefore, we have the following picture, where A' is A; B'is B; C'and D'are C and D:
(A',C'): [AB = D']
D': [AC = 0]
B': (D',A')+ (1, 1) [B = A'] - (2, 3) {B'= B}
It is clear that this is a Cartean circle, since the lines AB, AC and B can never meet except at their midpoint, namely (3,1) for AB meeting AC at (5,4), and (7,12) when BC meets CD at 4. In fact, this circle can be shown to be a square with sides parallel to the standard directions. More generally, for any positive rational number λ, we can define a set of rational points P′ that form a conic section of γ :
λP' + Σ*(P') = Λ*γ
where κ = ln ν and ε* is any integer value less than δ. If we let Π′ denote the set formed by all the rational numbers contained in ξP′, then we see that θP∗ = lim k →∞ ο kPk − Ϊi/2i, ιP = sup Ο ψiπi. Finally, there is an analogous formulation for the circles having rational parametres. By letting P̄ be the union of all these circles, together with their inverse images, denoted by ζP, it can now be defined that
ξ∕2 = ∏j∀i∑k∊N ijkP̂Pj + ∑j⋅jP˜j
and
T(x,y)∮= ∫ j∈J⇒∧’T∘mjx + T∝y
when ΰ is irrational. It is easily seen that these definitions agree with that given above. Since the same definitions can hold for rational maps, they can therefore be extended to rational functions on R. Given a rational function f:R → R, its ""discrete Jacobian"" is defined as
f̃ = [f(X)-X]∖X
such that f̷ is continuous and has a continuous inverse. Moreover, if the limit of f is zero, f′ is just the discrete inverse of x. Thus, a Rational function is completely determined by its discrete Jacobians. For instance, taking the composition of two rational polynomials whose coefficients are rational, gives the sum of their discrete quotients. Notice that if we define f(z) as z−1 and f(-z)=0 for all z, because f has the form f (z)-1=z, so we should have f (-1)=infinite. So, although the limits of certain functions are undefined, those functions can still be constructed. As a consequence, when we try to write a formula for a function, often we will get a slightly different formula depending on what we choose to put in the front. To illustrate this, consider the generating function for nth roots of unity: Let
n√x = nx∉∪{x}nx=1
then we find
$$\left[\frac{1}{n^{\deg x} }\right]_{"
Reliabilism Reliabilism is a nonevidentialist theory of knowledge that says that," truth conditions for epistemic modal expressions such as 'it is raining' are the same for all possible worlds, not just the most probable. This is called 'the no-overlap principle'. The main focus of its research has been on what it calls reliablism or relativism. Relativists argue that it is sufficient to know that A if you have a reliable basis for believing that (1) A is true, (2) there is at least one world in which A's truth is the case and (3) at any world where A fails to be true there exists some world W in such a way that, when I am in W, I can know the truth of (A) and still be justified in believing (B). Relatively, then, we can say that every belief is justified at some point in time. The best known of these theories is according to David Lewis, who calls it the Relationality Theory of Truth. Although the name'relativism' has several different meanings, let me stick with the one used by DavidLewis: it refers to a theory in epistemology that affirms that the conditions of justification for any belief are itself a matter of reliability. For example, a belief that water is red is more reliable than a false belief. There are other uses of the word'relative', but they do not seem to refer to the theory at hand. In the last few years, the term'reductivism'/'anti-reliabiltiy' came into use, though it does not appear in any of Lewis's writings. Let me explain what I mean by it. Suppose I have some experience that I call red, such that there seems to me to exist at most one possible world from which there could be a different experience called green. My experience of red could also be called red. I could continue to believe that either experience is correct. On the face of it, this would be an evidential challenge to my beliefs. So I might reply that my experience must be correct, because there really is only one experienced world. But how could I know this? I do think this is somewhat circular. If I were to reply something like 'well, since there isn't any other possible experiences, you've got to agree that your experience doesn't count' (and here again I emphasize that this discussion is about relisibilists), I'd be taking for granted that our experiences are indubitably reliable. However, if this reply is taken seriously, it will turn out that not only is there a possibility that some reality may be completely indistinguishable from other realities, but also that we don't know whether there are any such worlds. Consequently, although we may agree with this response, there does seem very much the risk that whatever we think we know about reality, is wrong. Of course, someone may well take the suggestion that anything is possible as a proof that everything is actually possible. It is also possible that someone will take my talk of an individuating reality as evidence for the existence of a completely indeterminate reality. Anyway, now suppose that instead of talking about an actual world, my relevant experience merely consists in saying that a possible environment exists. Then I should have an obvious problem, for reasons that will become clear later. Should I believe in a genuine possibility? That is, should I feel confident that perhaps there truly is some object whose existence I cannot be certain of? This too seems circular, and the answer is that again, anyone who takes this suggestion seriously will get into trouble. More generally, once we start thinking about the reliability of our beliefs, questions arise about what else we should be able to claim about our situation. Many people will assert that their beliefs are justified without considering what they know or even whether they are good reasons for holding them. Someone who accepts that an episteme is reliable is likely to question whether she is entitled to tell anyone else about her situation, nor whether telling others about it makes her more trustworthy. What kind of epistetic idealist ought I be? What sort of argument is I meant to raise? And what are my obligations to others? The notion of relativistic epistemia is thus not so much a normative one as an ontological one. Whatever the answers to these questions may turn up, however, they will depend on the particular views we take about epistemy. Put otherwise, relativist epistemies hold that what we share with others is simply a set of qualities we possess which is different from our own set; we are not the only ones to possess these traits. (On this point, see a recent book by Richard Feldman, Epistemic Justification: An Argument for Pluralism.) As a consequence, those who hold relativities are interested in questions of realism rather than truth. They are thus interested"
Final Cause and Necessity in Nature When Aristotle presents his theory of causation and the controversial," nature of necessity (and the contrast between cause and necessity), Aristotle's concern is with the natural world. The very nature itself of the world is the source of being that distinguishes it from other things, and this is especially true of life. Therefore, Aristotle seems to be taking for granted the existence of a necessary being, namely God, who is described by God as the origin of all being through which all things are generated. This being is something that exists not only before the beginning of things but also prior to their beginning. Thus, God is called “the Cause of Being” and ‘the Beginning and End of Things.’ The first of these definitions is somewhat vague, because it does not specify how the universe begins. In order to begin with, there must be a cause, but the cause must already exist. If a particular being lacks a specific cause (e.g., God) it can never have its beginning or end in time. (Aristotle's definition of „cause‟ is more consistent than any common translation we find.) Aristotle maintains that every being possesses a ‌cause. Any being exists through its own principles or elements, which come into being as a result of their combination. Consequently, each thing has its original cause in itself, although the causes themselves do not exist before being. Aristotle writes: ‚[T]he first principle of beings is that which they consist of, though they be originally of another nature, since they are the sum total of one and all their parts. Just as there is no part of an object which is without the whole, nor is there any part without those which compose it. All things proceed from the same thing, for no two things have the like form...'(Metaphysics, Book I, Chapter VII). This is a key passage in Aristotle on the basis of which he defines the nature and attributes of God. Our discussion below will follow from this definition. 2.2 Aristotle defines   God †in the form of his attributes. He explains that God has a body, soul, thought, intellect, reason, will, virtue, beauty, power, temper, action, volition, perfection, holiness, wisdom, piety, justice, goodness, tranquility, peace, health, safety, harmony, riches, possessions, powers, actions, events, circumstances, fortune, fate, misfortune, suffering, death, sickness, pain, diseases, perils, violence, lust, anger, rage, malice, ambition, pride, greed, hatred, fear, remorse, envy, wrath, righteousness, reticence, falsehood, duplicity, deception, quiddity, falseness, evil, carelessness, impudence, ignorance, rashness, ill temperation, suspicion, disquietude, temerity, timidity, conceit, indifference, obstinacy, vanity, self-confidence, arrogance, insolence; and these are such that they accompany the essence of that being which possesses them. [A]ll the other [divine] attributes depend on what they belong to; they cannot be given to anything without being joined to some other substance; but they always remain in the act of becoming, as soon as they appear in any being; so that, when we see something good, we think that it is owing to the presence of some good quality in it, whereas the truth is, that the good is present in both, merely because they possess the one. For example, the earth is admirable, having the quality of earth, even though it may not be named earth; for the ground of this earth appears to us as rough, hard, smooth, heavy, fiery, dull, sweet, light, fat, dense, fruitful, tender, dry, strong, small, active, extensive, busy, hot, cold, moist, near, far, narrow, lofty, obscure, wide, little, poor, wretched, rich, happy, miserable, prosperous, powerful, great, able, considerable, numerous, few, best, worst, honorable, notorious, fearful, pitiable, shameful, proud, fortunate, unhappy, blessed, deserving, unrighteous, perverse, licentious, wicked, prudent, righteous, honest, harsh, moderate, chaste, strict, miserly, charitable, merciful, godlike, pious, just, amiable; or else the sea, being water, looks and appears as watery, limpid, opaque, bright, thin, pale, turbid, muddy, glassy; yet it has the property of water."" Aristotle then gives several different senses of ""God"". The word    ‎ ‹‽ ‴‸ •‬ ‰ — ‡"
"The composition of the Earth Thales, argued to be the first philosopher by some, proposed"," a plan that would prove beneficial to mankind. The Thalean philosophy states that all living beings have an essence known as “the soul,” which in all things is the principle of life. This principle is contained in each individual being (being) and in the whole of creation. It should be understood that the Thalamontan or ‘soul’ is a pure principle, not a physical substance, for it is never found in physical form. Every being is one with the ’souls‘ of its nature and this is shown by its universal expression as the face of an individual, such as a human being.

The idea of a „soulish“ or a soul is an old one, dating back to ancient Egypt and Babylon, with certain parts of Judaism and Islam. In these systems, the ancient Egyptians called this spirit or soul the breath of Life (Breath of Soul, BSO). This spirit is sometimes thought of as having an existence separate from the body, yet it has many similarities with that of man. Many of these beliefs have been challenged and are now regarded as non-practical. More recently there has been a move away from a dualistic view of spiritual being to a monistic or holistic view. Although the heart of spirituality is indeed a spiritual, it does not mean that it can be achieved by means of some mystical method, as is seen in such books as A Course in Miracles and other ‚New Age‟ books. Whatever the case, those who subscribe to the theory of ″sous le corps″ know well that our bodies are only physical expressions of our souls. We can call them our physical ′sos‹, but they are not the same thing. Our physical sos, although it may possess a form, is in essence an energy, a living force which has an intrinsic nature independent of all physical processes. Physical life depends on the activity of this living power, and the life of another is only a passing shadow. To quote the great French scientist Pierre Paul Broca, who conducted a study into the workings of nerve fibers: ›The mind is like a plant, whose roots spread through the earth and which draws its nourishment from it. But when the plant dies, its roots return to their source and withdraw again; so the mind passes away.›1 As we see, no matter how much the physical body functions, even if it lacks the necessary elements of growth, life, death etc., it will continue to exist as long as there is something capable of maintaining itself, something which can generate a life-form outside itself. Therefore, since the human body is not physically isolated from other living creatures, because it shares its natural environment with them, therefore, any man or woman has his or her own individual ‿body‖, though not in any true sense a body at all. Hence, when a man speaks of his  ‱life  ‬as he sees it, he really means his own life as it exists in him. Thus, there can never be a total separation between the two. Since we are all united in life by a common bond, we can say that every man and woman is ‌somewhere‎in the midst of us, beneath the surface of everything, clinging to something strong, holding on to anything that may give help or comfort.2 It is thus that any being can become a part of me, my life…I am also included in your life and vice versa. …We are linked together in a most intimate way. Anyhow you cannot get away without my help! So I do not think that I can separate myself from you! …A life is best lived with others. If you love someone, you will always find yourself in contact with someone else. Love makes people happy and everyone wants to belong to somebody. Everyone wants love. Even if you are separated from somebody, let me tell you what it․is like when you live with somebody! You share the bed, sleep together, eat together. You often go to parties and enjoy yourself. And if neither of you has had sex before, suddenly you find out that you were meant to have it! Then everybody feels the urge to make love to each other and to express their feelings. All kinds of love affairs take place. There is love between families, between friends, lovers, couples, parents and children, brothers and sisters, wives and husbands. No matter what the age, sex, race, religion, class, education, economic status, nobody can escape from love! Once you have loved someone and felt close to someone you wanted to marry, then you could get married! The pressure of society to adopt the customs of other cultures makes it hard to meet anyone in our own. Why"
"God and Omnipotence According to traditional theology God must be omniscient, omnipotent, and"," all-powerful. This is the basis of a lot of Protestant and Catholic teaching. The main idea here is that God acts by means of his power, not in response to some need or evil being (as is sometimes supposed) but rather in accordance with his ultimate purposes and intention for creation. In other words, since God has power he has an intention to do good, which implies that he intends to cause all kinds of good things to occur (good will). God creates the universe to be a nice place where we can enjoy our good will. Therefore God intends for us to behave well and to satisfy our desires so that we don't hurt others as much as we might.



But that's not the only view. There are those who hold that there is no such thing as good or bad will, only good and evil intentions. That is simply because they believe that the will of God cannot be used by God to create anything that is bad, evil, or immoral. God is never concerned with evil and its consequences. For example, if it were possible that I could choose to not use my will to produce evil things, then I would not have a free will at all. But since it is not possible, I do have one. And I can use it to overcome evil as I see fit. (For example: I might want to drink a little whiskey, but I know that it will poison me.) So I have the freedom to choose whether I want this to happen.
This is what Protestants believe about the essence of the Christian faith. They believe in God's omnia, omnibus, ejusdem generis, literally ""out of all things"" or ""all-for-one."" All things are good for him. He has unlimited power to make everything happen as he wants it. To take something away from him is to disobey him and is therefore evil. Other Protestants say that Jesus is God incarnate and that every single good thing that happens to us is due to him; that our will is nothing more than his choice of what to put in our hearts, wills, actions, words. Not all Protestants are as monastic as they once were, though, because there are different schools of thought. Catholics, for example are known to believe, as the Church did until 1789, that only Jesus has real existence, while Protestant theologians have always believed in Jesus' divinity. Protestants also have their own set of morals which they adhere to as part of their faith, although they may disagree with them. Non-Protestants generally accept the standard teachings of both mainstream Protestantism and Catholicism, with the important difference that Protestant theology is extremely vague, claiming that any non-Christian who isn't partaking of Jesus's kingdom of heaven is guilty of sin. Orthodoxy, on the other hand, does not share this interpretation of Christianity. While it has varying levels of rigor and precision, the most widely accepted versions of Orthodox Christianity are the official doctrine of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia and Patriarch Kirill of Georgia. Both of these patriarchates are considered the leaders of today's Orthodox community and the two have led Orthodox communities for over half a century. Note that Orthodox beliefs are open to question, especially in regards to certain practices and dogma. Our discussion is focused on what they say about God and God creating human beings. Many people seem to agree that human experience is incomplete, so there must have been something before the beginning of time. If that were the case, there would be no purpose for the existence of humans, let alone a God. Every intelligent creature created by a divine creator must come into existence with a purpose, according to many Christians. Given that purpose and a natural desire to live, humanity must exist. As far as anyone knows, no other human species existed prior to the origin of humankind. Any other species would have met the same end, obviously. Nowhere in Scripture does Jesus say anything about this. Nor do they mention whether humans are responsible for anything. However, when Jesus says to his disciples, ""Whoever does the works [to fulfill his purpose] of him that sent me, do ye also do it?"" (John 5:18), it appears that this refers to humans and not, say, animals or plants. Although the disciples did not fulfill Jesus’s purpose in any significant way, they still lived lives that demonstrated Jesus's command to “do unto others” as Jesus told his followers to. So, Jesus would expect his sons and daughters to fulfill the Father‘s will by doing whatever was necessary to accomplish that great plan. Just as a human father would instruct his children to follow his instructions, a man who is commanded to love his wife and children would likewise instruct them to fully fulfill that role. We can assume that a mother"
"Question 9: Determinism and Free Will At first glance, the question as to whether human actions"," are determined or free seems very straightforward. The answer is “yes” if we accept that there is a necessary connection between the past and present in terms of causation. In other words, when we think of a past action, such as a murder, then the act is determined by something external to us (i.e., our mind). If we don’t think this, though, we can still deny the existence of determinism. This can occur through reasoning, because it is possible to infer from a set of past actions that some action has been determined, for example, by God, therefore, it will happen again.

However, if you think that human freedom is not a possibility, you can argue that it does not follow from this fact that an act had to be determined in the first place. For example: Consider that God has provided us with free will. Would it be impossible to have a free choice when there was no causality? And if it was possible, would it necessarily make sense to talk of freedom? It seems that the answer must be yes, but the reason why we should think so is that we see that every action is connected with the previous actions in a way that makes them causally connected. Therefore, each time we choose a course of action we are making use of the causal connections between preceding actions. But now, let‘s say that I have chosen to drink a Coke, and that Coke has caused me to fall asleep. How do I know that this is the only reason for my action? The reason is simple: I can ask God what Coke did to me, since Coke was one of my causes. Thus, I could say ‘God gave Coke to cause me‖, instead of „God caused Coke‟. So even though God did not create the Coca-Cola, he still had a direct effect on my actions; and because he had direct effects, although they were not necessary, his actions were still determined. And that brings us back to the fact about necessity. It is clear that, in any case, God creates the actions we take, hence, once we start thinking about it, there must also be a necessity involved in each action. We can call this the ‚necessary connection  of causation›. Given this explanation of necessity, which requires us to understand causals logically, anyone can affirm that freedom does exist. However, this raises the obvious question, does determinists have the same view of free actions?
(Answer: No.) A determinist thinks that free choices are available, at least in principle. Although there are good reasons to think otherwise, deterministic logic allows us—in general—to say anything we like. Just as there may be some causal connection to earlier events, so there often is one to later events. Our free decision to steal a cigarette may have been caused by our previous decisions, thus, our subsequent actions could also have followed from those decisions. Similarly, someone else might decide to rob a bank, causing others to open fire on him. Both of these decisions can be understood as based on causal relationships. Someone who stole a house, on the other hand, cannot be seen as having done so based solely on luck. Rather, people have certain motivations that cause them to behave in certain ways. Suppose that one day, Jack has decided to run away from home and run into danger. He has two possible reasons for doing so: he may simply want to get away or he might be afraid of his mother. Neither of those two possibilities is actually responsible for his decision. To make things worse, both of their reasons are based in causal relationships, namely, a causal relationship between his willingness to go and a sudden appearance of danger at home. Now, suppose that Jack decides to tell his parents about his plans. Even if they believe him, they may still be able to prevent him from going. Under this assumption, however,Jack‡could not have gone. His initial decision was based purely on his fear of being apprehended, not on any desire to flee. Consequently, no free action can ever be completely determined within the realm of causal relations. Moreover, as soon as we speak of deciding, obviously there will be exceptions to this rule. Should we say, ‹If Jack decided not to inform his family, than he did nothing wrong′? Of course, nobody can say this. Whatever happens, results from the decision are still subject to causal interactions, even when neither of its causes is responsible. What we mean here is simply that our actions depend on something outside of us. Nothing outside us can determine what we do. Finally, maybe Jack is guilty of stealing a property. Since he has stolen the property, presumably it has already happened somewhere. Furthermore, whatever happens depends entirely on what"
Hume and Smith on Justice Adam Smith and David Hume agree that rules of justice," can be derived from human conduct, and that the just distribution of property will take place if all members of society are rational and virtuous. The problem, according to Hume, is that in many cases the laws of social life are contrary to these rules; that is, they tend to encourage the pursuit of wealth or other material objects over the protection of those same goods. In other words, when there are competing claims for the same thing, the distribution tends to be uneven. This, Hume argues, gives rise to conflict, which he terms ""excesses of passion."" For Hume then, it is not the state of affairs that makes men unjust but the excesses thereof. For example, if a man has an estate worth £100,000, he will be tempted by an offer of £30,00 to buy it. But if this price is too high, though the offer was made, we should not be surprised to see him sell his estate and keep only £60, 00 instead. He has acted reasonably, but he still has suffered an excess of his own passion. Hume's view is much criticized in modern times (Bacon 1876: I, 515-516; Stoughton 1939: II, 3-5), but it has had considerable influence on many recent sociologists. Not all social problems can really be explained in terms of excessiveness, such as Hume argued, because there is a natural tendency toward equality and harmony. Nor do some problems, like the one mentioned above, always turn out to stem from excession.

"The Evaluative Role of Pain Eric suggested in class that pain fulfills criterion E, the"," evaluatively important role. The evalulative importance of pain is that it influences not only individuals' beliefs and attitudes but also their interactions with others. Although this is the most familiar role for pain, there are other evalulatory roles. This class taught that, for example, pain may influence the level of attention one pays to another person or a situation. In other cases, though, such as when a child who is being bullied by another child attends a play party, it may be appropriate to tell the bully to ""watch where you're going."" We can find different ways to express this evaluating function of suffering and pleasure. Many of these functions are nonfunctional. For example: • A lack of pleasure is not functional; it does not need to be taken into account for any practical purpose. It does, however, provide a sense of violation and violation of expectation. • As long as there is no real harm, taking pleasure in suffering is sufficient to warrant moral concern. (A) I have been told by the teacher that I should not care about my health because I suffer from asthma. My asthma has caused me to miss school for three days each year and to run short of breath during the winter. Should I continue to take pleasure from my suffering, or should I stop caring about myself? (B) If I do not take enough pleasure now, I will get sick later on. Therefore, my enjoyment of my illness is an indirect way of influencing future health. Having said this, we should stress that our pleasure needs to arise from a genuine concern for ourselves and our children. Our pleasures need not be directed toward our physical well-being. We may take delight in merely thinking about what it will be like to die. That pleasure may carry with it a suggestion that we ought to think more about our health, although it needn't be a serious suggestion. More generally, when we think of a possible future, our primary motivation may not consist in getting good health at some distant time. Rather, those motivations will involve how well we can handle the prospect of death. Such concerns are not based on mere indulgence, but on a concern that matters to us personally. To illustrate this point, let us consider a case in which our main motivation is to avoid the loss of our own health through ill health itself. Suppose that the doctor tells us that if we don't take adequate rest we will lose our ability to breathe. Would this motivate us to put off our work until after we had recovered, thereby losing out on the income that would accrue from our labor? Again, this might be regarded as a minor motivating factor, since we might also imagine ourselves to gain nothing from delaying our activity. However, if this desire were the primary motivating reason for our delay, then it would be necessary to have a strong reason to prevent the disease from occurring. Now, even though we may agree that having a large number of people around us who are ill is bad, and that its avoidance is desirable, nobody would argue that avoiding the risk of being ill itself is something we seek. Given this fact, someone might attempt to object that perhaps the desire to preserve our life is greater than the wish to enjoy our longevity. But this would not make sense. If we are concerned about the long-run consequences of having an ill body, rather than our short-term impact on our bodies, why would we wish so seriously to postpone our bodily functions? Nevertheless, while we disagree over the amount of justification we need in order to feel pleasure, they are still both relevant to our evaluation of whether we have the right to expect pain. Finally, as we've seen, pleasure need only occur in response to a specific situation in accordance with our interests. Even if it weren't clear that this was the case, people might worry about wanting too much pleasure at a particular time, especially if they believe that their interests are being subordinated to someone else's. These considerations suggest that satisfaction of certain kinds of happiness need require more justification than is sometimes granted in normative theory. Consider, again, a parent who wants his child to live healthy and happy lives, not because he believes that doing so is in his daughter's best interests, nor because it is justified to him. He simply wishes his son to lead a happy and healthy life. When the mother expresses her pleasure to the girl, she is expressing her willingness to meet the needs of her daughter, whatever they may turn out to matter to her personally, without regard to anything that she might want. On this basis, her claim is plausible. She may accept that her personal interest is served by her love for her child, yet she may still feel that either she or her other interests must be subordined to hers. Nor do I see any reason why a mother should give up her hopes of meeting her children's needs just because they happen to"
